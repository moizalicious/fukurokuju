{"reviews": [{"id": 249, "score": 40, "body": "Rockman.EXE/MegaMan NT Warrior is one of those series which was modified fairly heavily in transit to English, 4Kids-style... but to tell you the truth, that doesn't make a huge difference, as it's a pretty heavily Westernized Saturday-morning-cartoon style anime by design. 90% of the changes in the English version weren't for content. In fact, they don't seem to be for any reason at all. But I digress. This review covers both the Japanese and English versions (which, again, the difference isn't as huge as other examples).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n __Writing:__ The storyline somewhat follows the plot of the first two Battle Network games (of which this series is based off of)... eventually. Truthfully, it pretty much skips over the entire first game, as the first half of the series has a very cartoony, episodic, adventure-of-the-week structure to it, with the WWW agents from Battle Network 1 given wackier personalities and made the proverbial Team Rocket of the series. Fairly typical for a Saturday morning kid's show, but not exactly a shining beacon of ingenuity in terms of writing.\r\n\r\nThe second half of the series enters into the plot of Battle Network 2, and does a somewhat faithful job in following the storyline... with the exception that most of the Gospel navis' operators never make appearances (I guess implying that they're all standalone navis) and that a rather large plot element was changed at the end of the story which eliminated one character entirely. But compared to the first half of the series, still a relatively faithful effort.\r\n\r\nNow, I could go on about the many silly changes made from Japanese to English, but this being a Saturday morning cartoon sort of anime, that much is kind of a given. What's really silly is that they made changes from the English versions of the games, which were themselves already changed in transit--I can only guess this had to do with ease of animation, which would explain how Mayl became \"Maylu.\" Gives me Lamu flashbacks. Anyway, while most modern dubs are quite faithful adaptations, this is not one such case--entire episodes are cut from the English version, so the only way you're really going to get the whole story is in Japanese. Of course, if you don't care too much about the story (you're not missing too much) and just want a fun, nostalgic cartoon ride, either version is perfectly suitable--and it is pretty fun to hear Light Yagami barking orders at MegaMan.   ...oh, and Mr. Match's accent is pretty awesome, too.\r\n\r\n __Art__ is fairly typical for the type of anime this is. It's meant to be pretty simplistic and Westernized, and... well, it succeeds. There's really not a whole lot to say here.\r\n\r\n __Sound__, I also feel I've pretty much covered already above. None of the voices are ear-grating in either dub of the show, but you're not likely to be blown away by any heartfelt performances, either.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all, the series as a whole is a fairly mediocre one with low production values and a very Western target audience upon inception. It's a pretty toyetic show which the producers didn't feel the need to expend a lot of time, effort, or resources on, and it shows. If you're looking for a great anime series with a strong storyline, well-developed characters, and brilliant plot twists, you'd best go elsewhere. If you're a fan of the Battle Network games, like me, and the thought has crossed your mind that \"Y'know I bet it'd be kind of cool to see this series animated,\" feel free to give it a watch. It can be fun for nostalgia purposes, but doesn't hold a lot of water on its own merits."}, {"id": 328, "score": 48, "body": "Setokai no Ichizon is, for the lack of better words, a cliched story. In fact, its so cliche that you can just rename it to generic harem story #42515. What's the story? Harem. What's the animation? Harem. What's the subplot? Harem. Its almost as if Seitokai no Ichizon just plans to cash in on greasy neckbeards whose only happiness comes from wish-fulfillment characters such as the main lead, Ken Sugisaki - whose only interest is playing eroge and constantly talking about it with girls who are clearly repulsed by them. Still, for some reason, the girls fall in love with him - because that's what a harem is.\r\n\r\n __Artwork and Animation (8/20)__\r\nThe artwork is horrible - nay, atrocious on a very good day. Its grainy and flimsy. So let's start in sequence. Firstly, faces. The facial features are terrible, and the faces are overgrown to shit (like, more than half the size of the body), which is quite pronounced in Kurimu and Minatsu's characters. The others have it too, just not to a very high degree.\r\n\r\nNext up, the environment, which is also quite horrible. It is sparsely detailed and it never can create the environment needed and its a far cry from good. It looks terrible and there is nothing to it. The council room (which is where 80% of the work is done) could have seriously done with a revival. Its just a table, some chairs and a bunch of boxes. Atleast put SOMETHING there, it isn't a shack. \r\n\r\nAnd, now the animation. The animation is choppy, flies every which way and combined with the horrible artwork it just might kill you. Character movements are cluttery at best and the action scenes look ridiculous. Even the breast physics are crap.\r\n\r\nOther than that, the only releases of seitokai no ichizon today that have any seeds are 480p versions...so good luck with that.\r\n\r\n __Sound and Music (12/20)__\r\nThe voice acting is pretty bad, and I could never really feel sucked into the story because of how dull the sounds -in general- were. The only person that was even a bit convincing was Lilicia's character, and other than that, the characters were flat as a board.\r\n\r\nThe music is kind of a saving grace of the series, with atleast its OP being good and quite catchy and had a somewhat good music video. Sadly, even this falters when it comes to the ED. The ED is terrible and has a boring music video. Of course, it could just be my shitty taste in music.\r\n\r\n __Story - Or lack thereof (10/20)__\r\nThe story line in Seitokai no Ichizon doesn't quite exist. It is more comedy than having an actually decent storyline. While the comedic effect isn't bad, it relies too much on references - and not even good ones at that. Like, honestly, what's the point of a reference if it is thinly veiled, and even mentioned in the official description? Like, seriously. References are supposed to be inside jokes, and you aren't supposed to base an entire season's worth of episodes on them. That gets old really, really quick. And god forbid you are on the outside of the inside joke, because that will destroy whatever little comedic effect Seitokai no Ichizon does have. Other than the references, the only other source of comedy is the girls beating up MC in rapidly escalating sadistic ways because the MC said something they didn't like or were embarrassed about, which I guess is funny for some, but for me, it was just too cliche.\r\n\r\nSo far we have already established that Seitokai no Ichizon is nothing on its own and relies on other \"classical\" anime to get its viewer base. Now, its story? Surprisingly enough, the story is pretty good, not there is enough of it, but when it does come, its great. The overall story (and in turn, most of the development) only shows its face at the start and end of individual arcs, which is disappointing to say the least. Still, when it does get executed, it almost looks like the romance was good enough. Plot progression is pretty bad though.\r\n\r\n __Characters (8/20)__\r\nHonest to god, what's the worst and blandest characters you ever saw? No one really cares, cause Seitokai no Ichizon is gonna take all those titles away. By far the characters were absolutely dreadful and cliche. I'll go in order.\r\n\r\nKen Sugisaki - The main character and a pervert, he constantly mentions that he wants to make a harem out of the student council and repeatedly gets his ass kicked. He plays a lot of eroges and his only positive quality is that he sits after school to finish all the work the \"cute girls\" couldn't do and hence establishing himself as the \"man\", you know, since women love responsible people.\r\n\r\nKurimu Sakurano - The token loli and the character that \"is in highschool but hasn't grown since elementary school\". her job is to act as the girl who brings in breast envy and whines about how she is a 'lady' while going head-over-heels for candy. For all intents and purposes, she IS an elementary school student, who was sent to high school as an excuse so that people who sexualize her can say \"I'm totally not a pedophile bro, 17 year olds are fair game!\"\r\n\r\nMinatsu Shiina - The typical \"Tough chick\" who is good at sports and beats the MC for being a pervert. She also likes action games and is -for some weird reason- good at maths. Her entire plot goes around her trying to protect her sister from the lecherous hands of Sugisaki.\r\n\r\nChizuru Akaba - The \"mature\" woman. This can't be said enough. SHE IS MATURE. LIKE, REALLY MATURE. The plot constantly reminds you of this by repeatedly mentioning that she makes more money than everyone combined and already has a high profile job. She is also a sadist whose only job is to act as a maternal guardian towards Kurimu the loli. Wait, how the fuck does sadistic and maternal go together? Because its a harem, that's why it goes together.\r\n\r\n __Enjoyment (10/20)__\r\nWhile Seitokai no Ichizon isn't  _bad_ it isn't good either. Not if you don't like watching the same shit you watched in harem anime #125. Still, It has some comedic relief and its storyline can sometimes be fairly intense. But in hindsight, it end up being just what it wants to be, it copies every harem anime ever and ends like every harem anime ever - mediocre. Best I can call it is a good copypasta.\r\n\r\nI won't write a review for its second season (Seitokai no Ichizon lv 2) because I haven't watched it, and I most probably won't either.\r\n\r\nFinal verdict - 48/100"}, {"id": 371, "score": 40, "body": "I'll start this review off with the obligatory statement that, as with all entries in the Night Shift Nurses franchise, this is a very extreme hentai series with plenty of bondage, scat, and other such content matter that many would consider undesirable. So if you're squeamish, don't even bother reading past this point--this series isn't for you. Now... Night Shift Nurses 2 (technically, it's not licensed, but we all know \"ni\" means \"two\") is a direct sequel to the original series in that at least two characters make reappearances, but falls short compared to its predecessor in many areas, not the least of which is the storyline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n __Writing:__ The general premise of the series remains consistent in that the hospital seeks to employ a doctor who will train unwitting nurses into sex slaves for the institute's own profit... but the fact that the hospital would rehash the exact same gambit again after the less-than-desirable outcome of the first series (the definition of insanity is trying the exact same thing multiple times and expecting different results) defies any logical sense and says that the producers were rather desperate to find some way to continue a series that really wasn't meant to be continued.\r\n\r\nSetting the big unrealistic plot element aside, there are several smaller instances of unrealistic script and dialogue throughout the series that were not present in the original. This is especially noticeable in the character interactions. In the original series, most would not have considered the doctor a sympathetic character, to be sure, but he had some level of compassion and intimacy with his subjects, and worked their minds such that they developed feelings for him, giving the series a very psychological aspect. In Night Shift Nurses 2, the main character lacks this sort of manipulative aura... in fact, he's just plain physically abusive, and that's all there is to his character. His subjects all develop feelings for him, regardless, however--hence my assessment of this sequel being much less realistic than the original in terms of writing.\r\n\r\n __Art:__ The art hasn't changed too much, thankfully, as the series is regarded as being one of the higher-end pieces in the field of hentai. There may be just a bit less detail than the first series, which one might attribute to the fact that the franchise had already established its place in the industry by the time this sequel was produced, but Night Shift Nurses 2 is still one of the better-animated hentai series out there.\r\n\r\n __Sound__ is also something I can't really complain about. The Japanese voices all played their roles as well as any other hentai, and the music was suited to the screen. It did feel a bit less recognizable than the original series' soundtrack, which had a very distinct theme to it, but nonetheless manages to maintain viewer interest. Unlike the first series, this one has added a proper opening song and closing song, like other anime... which feels weird in a hentai, to me, but I'll leave the judgement of whether this was a good decision or not up to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the end, Night Shift Nurses 2 could be considered good for a hentai, but it did not live up to the standards set by its predecessor in being good not only as a hentai, but as an anime. A couple characters from the original series return for this one; most don't. If you found yourself at all attached to the original characters, this may be worth a view, but I wouldn't expect to see a holy grail of hentai if I were you."}, {"id": 422, "score": 10, "body": "School of Bondage is... unremarkable, to say the least. But if I said the least, this wouldn't be a very long or useful review, now would it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n __Writing:__ As far as hentai series go, the writing is well below average. And that doesn't bode well for it on the overall scale. The plot, as you've likely read in the above synopsis, begins with a chauvinistic fuck who preaches that women are nothing but animals looking for a good plowing. When the female class rep tries to change his mind, she agrees to be his slave for three months in order to prove her dedication to love over lust. Let's stop here. This plot has already completely abandoned any remote sense of believability due to the fact that if you placed those two character models in that scenario a million times over, such an agreement would never be made... chiefly because this decision only helps the chauvinist's case. I could go on to explain how the writing only gets more ridiculous from there, how the series sends perhaps the worst possible message at the end of the day, and how none of the characters are even remotely likable, but after someone asks for extra mustard on their sandwich to prove how much they hate mustard, I feel like the case has been made for me.\r\n\r\n __Art:__ The art is... average, for a hentai. Which, again, doesn't carry over well into the grand scheme of things. On the bright side, everything isn't drawn at a 3:1 hentai-to-reality ratio of size, but it's certainly nothing to write home about, and doesn't help the terrible writing in the slightest.\r\n\r\n __Sound:__ The music is simple and repetitive, and the vocals are exaggerated and artificial. As far as production values go, you won't find a more utterly average hentai out there.   ...or, I guess you will. That's what makes it an average, I suppose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, School of Bondage is a hentai with a terrible story, terrible characters, and terrible writing which would not benefit from the saving grace of good animation or audio even if I considered either of these things to be saving graces for a terrible show. Unless you're really scraping the barrel, pass over this one."}, {"id": 437, "score": 39, "body": "I don't usually write reviews for harem + ecchi anime. The reasoning is quite simple, there is nothing to review. Every one of these goes pretty much the same way, and I never like it. Still, I make an exception for To-Love ru since I have  watched the previous two seasons, and used to be pretty committed to it. The other reason being that To-Love Ru actually tried to create a story which was somewhat different from the others. TRIED? Yep, tried and failed.\r\n\r\nThe series has been, for a long time considered the face of Harem + Ecchi genre, and why wouldn't it be? Its got a denser than potato MC, a massive harem, quality artwork, a moronic fanbase, and the most important of all - nudity.\r\n\r\nArtwork (14/20)\r\nThe artwork is the same as it was the previous two seasons, some improvement has been made on character models but nothing worth noting. The animation has definitely improved though (not the day to day animation, think more along the lines of breast physics, which, now that I think about it, IS day to day animation). The partially nude scenes have been somewhat improved (I won't provide pics, because site policy)\r\nAt the same time, neither of these is something to write home about (see how 10 is average on a scale of 20), its good, but it isn't over the top eye candy, so I give it a 14. \r\n\r\nMusic and Sound (8/10)\r\nThe music stays true to tradition and is rubbish. I don't know if it has something to do with the series itself, but out of all the To-Love Ru Music, I could barely just tolerate Motto To-Love Ru's OP, I just skipped the rest. Darkness is no exception to this. Its OP and ED were horrible (including their videos). The only redeeming quality in an otherwise ruined music section is the music accompanying the usual fights which is mediocre, but its still something.\r\n\r\nPlot (7/20)\r\nTo-Love Ru never had a plot. I don't care what the fans say, pulling something approaching a story at the end of episode 10 and taking it all the way to episode 12 is NOT a plot. Its just a last minute hope of trying to end something that never began. For some reason people believe that harem as a genre is something more than a cocktease, but it isn't. Some seek closure (who does the guy pick?!?!), but it always ends the same way, the guy just chooses everyone or comes off with some sweet platitudes which somehow calm down the girl in question (that's why its called a harem, duh)\r\nDarkness deviates from it -which I suppose is a good thing- and tries to create something fresh. Rito is told about his harem right into the first episode, and Momo starts doing shit. But once again, I got my hopes up, and had them trashed. Momo's bullshit tactics just serve to create typical \"uncomfortable\" situations which are present in every anime ever, and her motives are more than just stupid. The plot lacks flow and goes too fast (though it could be just me because I read the manga) which leads to \"oh we just met, and you are a stupid as fuck person who grabbed by breasts, but I love you now and let's do uncomfortable stuff together after which you won't take responsibility and will forget all about it by saying 'what was that all about?'\" you know like it happens in every poorly written anime ever. To Love Ru tries VERY hard to create something approaching a story, but in the end it really is just momo or golden darkness flipping out and beating everyone ever using something they never mentioned before and turns out they had all along. \r\n\r\nCharacters (5/20)\r\nTo-Love Ru drops the development and focus from Lala and Haruna and moves its focus to Momo, Golden Darkness and Mea. All of which are boring robots with no emotions at all and have no development except the extremely forced development handed over to Mea and that Run guy/girl. Not that even the forced development serves any purpose beyond it being used as a shitty fanservice device sometime in the future, but well, atleast they are trying, as opposed to the moronic degeneracy that was the original To-Love Ru. Out of all the new/revamped characters I didn't like a single one, even the somewhat tolerable and moralistic Kotegawa fell from grace and became shit.\r\n\r\nEnjoyment (5/20)\r\n404 not found. Sorry if I don't think ONLY with my dick. Yeah sure, naked girls are nice, but having them naked all the time doing retarded crap gets boring REALLY fast.\r\n\r\nIf you actually like the To-Love Ru series for any reason, go ahead and watch it, nothing will stop fanboys.\r\nIf you just want a decent fap, go get some hentai, it will save you a lot of bandwidth, and will probably work better than this cesspool of cancer. \r\nIf you are just a passerby, get the hell away from Darkness at any cost, its only  _trouble_\r\nSee what I did there?"}, {"id": 458, "score": 39, "body": "Sword Art Online (or SAO) is an entry level series for all those that aren't really into watching anime. For seasoned viewers though, its an absolute train wreck. While SAO does function better than most anime on some levels, its weak story and pathetic characters all but wreck the series for the veterans. On the other hand, the new kids on the block are too enthralled by the pretty colors to look past the facade that passes for a story. Now, I'm not saying SAO is  _bad_  it has plenty of strong points even the haters will falter against, but that doesn't make it good, now does it? I mean more along the lines of \"the cons overweight the pros\" in the case of SAO. \n\nI'm pretty sure you have heard this term overused to kingdom come, but SAO had potential - potential it wasted.\n\n _ Note - This review is spoiler free, it might appear that I'm treading into spoiler territory, but I won't. You just gotta trust me on this, okay? _\n\n  Artwork and Animation (8/10)\nThe artwork is by far the strongest field of SAO, but let's proceed in order here.\n\n __Character Models__ - After all, what is an anime without a pretty face? The character model hits spot-on with the flagship of Asuna and to a lesser degree Kirito. Both of whom are created quite well and both attract great amounts of fans from either gender. Still, the level of detail in facial features is quite lacking.\n\n __Environment__ - The environment is lush and green with sprawling cities and major architectural structures which greatly add to the entire \"town\" atmosphere. With its great amount of detail, it is evident that the entire environment looks great. \n\n __Animation__ - Broadly speaking, the animation is also quite good - this is especially the case during the fights in which the animation probably plays the biggest part in the immersion. While that may be the case, I noticed that some day-to-day activities seemed to be....cluttery and unsynced (one of many examples would be ep 10, around the 11:42 mark). Now, while that may be an uncommon occurrence, it is still there, and it is helluva annoying when it happens since in one deft move it completely destroys the immersion (and please don't say that animation hadn't progressed that far in end-2012, cause it had, take a look at KSnH, tell me if it happens there). Still, considering how great it is overall, it almost feels like my complaint is nitpicking.\n\nWith all that said, I still won't go as far as to call SAO eye-candy. There are plenty of anime that were released earlier or almost with SAO that look much better than it in terms of Character Models and Animation (KSnH, Durarara, Psycho-Pass, etc). Still, it is undeniable that its environment is among the best of its kind.\n\n  Sound and Music (7/10)\nSome people count the music as one of the stronger points of SAO, while I don't disagree, I don't agree either. \nI agree that it is one the stronger things about SAO.\nI disagree with the implication that it is great - for the sole reason that it isn't.\n\n __Voice acting__ - I have no qualms about the voice acting and I'm fine either way with voice acting since I don't honestly speak the language. Still, I can feel the emotions in the voice across a totally (not totally, but still) unknown language, and that part is spot-on. Despite that, I don't exactly feel  _connected_  to the characters in any way, but that is probably the stupid plot's problem.\n\n __Environment__ - Now, by environment here, I mean noises in the background, like town chatter or the sound of insects, even the clash of swords. And all of this felt....artificial. And faint, mostly artificial though. \nNow, it is obvious that the cast didn't get real swords and clash them in from of a mic, but still, having such hollow sounding noises just doesn't allow one to immerse themselves in their surroundings. Then, there is the fault of faintness. The background noises are so low below the general talk volume that it almost feels neglected.\n\n __Background Music__ - The background music is mostly just violin and guitar, which sounds perfect for more...emotional scenes, but for the action scenes, there isn't any strong or intense BGM to really bring the feel of the battle. Yeah, there is some light drumming and something that sounds like a faint and repetitive dong, but it just doesn't quite do its job. If you would better have an example, then try watching ep10 or ep14 of SAO, skip to the fight scene, watch it, and then watch ANYTHING from SnK. You will understand the difference something like background music can make.\n\n __OP and ED__ - The OP01 (Crossing Field - by Lisa) wasn't quite good enough. It was good, but not good enough. Yeah, it had a great AMV, but other than that it gets boring really fast, and even then it probably wasn't worth adding to your playlist anyways. The other memorable entry in the music section is ED02 (Overfly - by Haruna Luna) which is just great. Its definitely worth listening to, even though it has a somewhat weak AMV. The others (OP02 and ED01) were both fairly average, nothing that I will waste my time with though.\n\nyoutube(CpDyF4pkbAs)\n\nSorry, couldn't find the AMV, but I linked the official video.\n\n Story (10/30)\nThe story section marks the beginning of the downfall of SAO. Yeah, we were at the supposedly good sections before.\n\n __Premise__ - The premise relies around a Virtual Reality Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (VRMMORPG) called, well, SAO which is supposed to be a real craze, and after the release everyone buys it in a hurry. Sadly, after just a short while, they realize that they can't log out and return to their normal lives, they are forever trapped in the game because the creator conveniently backstabbed them into staying in the game forever and if they die, they die forever. Because game developers totally destroy their own lives and deconstruct their hard work by creating a game which allows them to annoy totally random greasy neckbeards for reasons unknown (and never revealed)\n\nStill, I can't deny that the premise has potential. Plenty of potential in the MMO genre considering that most of the anime viewerbase plays one online game or the other, and it is always fun to watch something you can directly relate to. Sadly, SAO took all that, built people's hopes until episode 2 and then cut those hopes to little bits.\n\n __Execution__\nThe execution is just that - an execution. An execution of all the potential and the hopes that were put into SAO by viewers everywhere. It is almost as if SAO as a series is a facade that does exactly what it portrays happens - A creator destroys the hopes of no-lifers everywhere. Despite its rather solid premise, SAOs power lasted only until ep2, after which the next few episodes were just filler crap about how Kirito can steamroll over everything ever - and all by himself! As any MMO player ever will tell you, going solo is  _the_  best way of getting killed, no matter what your skill level is. It is an inherent fault in humans as a whole that they will make mistakes. One wrong step, one slow dodge, and you are dead. Forever. This is especially true at higher levels with more and more intelligent and  powerful enemies that just can't be taken down solo. Despite being an advanced gamer, Kirito doesn't understand such basic things and goes solo against great odds- and wins where entire teams of his level fail. Because why the fuck not, he is kirito.\n\nHonestly, that is the explanation for all of the events in the series. \"Why the fuck not, he is Kirito\" Nothing else is needed, he is stronger than dozens of people of his level and he can break the game using sheer rage as his weapon. Because why the fuck not, he is kirito. \n\nThis is literally the only thing that happens until Episode 9. After that, the story somewhat continues, but having already broken its momentum, it falls straight on its face, because, let's face it - Nothing happened the past few episodes. Episode 10 seems like it will finally be able to recreate, maybe even rekindle SAO's flame -and it does to some point- but then comes episode 11, which destroys even that and goes back to its filler bullshit.\nand stays there until it thinks \"oh well, maybe I should end this arc\". Then it does some stuff and the arc ends. Just like that. The next arc is totally spoiler territory, so not gonna discuss it. If you want a concise description though - Its shit. Even worse than the first arc.\n\nNow, let's do a quick review of its genres and how well they were pulled it off.\n\n __Action__ - Mostly okay-ish, its lacking through the entire series and the biggest reason for that (besides the BGM support and the filler crap) is that it ends too quickly. And there is honestly nothing to lose, we all know Kirito is gonna lolwtfpwn everything, hardly makes me give a crap or even get excited.\n\n __Adventure__ - Don't know what classifies as adventure in your books, but pretty sure its supposed to be a challenge.\n\n __Game__ - Well, its in a game...so, yeah.\n\n __Romance__ - Terrible, terrible romance. Mostly because the time jump (forcing two and a half years worth of stuff in 5 episodes) really messed everything up and doesn't allow for a sensible start (or end) to the genre. The romance is therefore extremely rushed. It resolves, but who gives a crap if it isn't gonna build up?\n\n __Shounen__ - Big boobed pretty gamer girls and wish-fulfillment OP MC who every girl digs Yeah, sounds like shounen to me.\n\n Characters [4/30]\nThe characters are, by far the weakest link in the chain of SAO. The characters are bland, unbelievable, undeveloped, and if they aren't Kirito or Asuna, probably pathetically weak.  ~! and most probably dead by the end of the episode they appeared in. !~\n\nKazuto Kirigaya (also, Kirito) - He acts as the MC and also as the Gary Stu. As I already pointed out, he rolls over everything and anything. He is probably the height of a wish fulfilling character. He is strong, everyone depends on him, women love him, he is cool as shit (doesn't use a shield, uses a single sword, goes solo and doesn't afraid of anything) and he gets all the girls. Like, ALL of them despite actually being a shut-in betafag. Once again, because why the fuck not? He is kirito.\n\nAsuna Yuuki - As someone who loves a strong female lead (and even reads crappy shoujo if it means having one) I loved Asuna from the get go, she seemed strong, independent and pretty cool (okay, I sound like a feminist now, I promise I'm not) but then her character changed (one of the few character to have a character development, btw) and then she became a 1860's housewife. Like, really. Her entire point was to look cute, and be a total burden to everyone around her by being absolutely useless. After the first two episodes, she always needs kirito to save her.  ~! in episode 10, when kirito is paralyzed by the poisoned water she comes to his rescue, but then it is kirito that finishes off the enemy, not her. Then of course, we have ALO which was ridiculous from her point as she became a damsel in distress.In ALO, you could replace her with a shiny sword that kirito REALLY wants and the story won't change the least bit. !~\n\nSuguha Kirigaya - Cousin and adoptive sister of kirito and pointless other than as a imouto type character who looks cute and shit while kirito kills everything.

It does its job as a starter anime quite well by roping in people who don't care about anime, but that is really all SAO is, it holds nothing for a viewer that appreciates a story or even wants something interesting. Because even though SAO tries very hard to mask its faults (and succeeds against most of the people that watch it), upon hindsight, you can't help but glare at all the holes and say \"Did I honestly enjoy this piece of crap?\"\n\nThat only applies to the first arc by the way, the second arc is so shit it isn't even masked anymore.

If you had any misconceptions about that, I hope they have been cleared up. It's also the first gay OR shota hentai I've watched, as far as I can remember, thus killing two broads with one testicle. I may be a harsh critic, but there's absolutely nothing I just plain won't watch. I'm told it's also the first hentai anime of its kind. I have no idea if this is true or not, but it's certainly the first I've seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n __Story:__ The story of this episode is of Pico, a young crossdressing boy working at his grandfather's bar for the summer, and the 24-year-old man he's left with by his no-fucks-given elder. The two of them very quickly start an explicit relationship. All NAMBLA jokes aside, it's a fairly sweet story, if not very inspired. I didn't despise it, but at the same time, there's not much good to say about it from a purely writing perspective. The plot moves very unrealistically quickly, jumping almost immediately from meeting to sex, and the conflict in the episode is perhaps the most generic and overused in any love story, bringing nothing new to the table at all. Truthfully, the fact that the romantic partner is a young boy is completely inconsequential to the plot. You could replace Pico with an 18+ girl with exactly the same reactions and lines of dialogue and you'd have a very cookie-cutter hentai series that still made perfect sense. Not that I'm saying he should be an 18+ girl; rather, I'm saying that if a story is about man-boy love, it should be at least in some way reflected in the plot, rather than taking a standard, overused formula and lazily replacing the female love interest with a shota.\r\n\r\n __Art:__ The artwork is actually fairly strong in this series. Very pretty, cleanly drawn, and even cute. Animation was fluid, and overall, I have no complaints to speak of. The creators are quite fond of man-nipples. You don't see those too often in anime.\r\n\r\n __Sound:__ I've heard complaints about some of the sound effects used in this series, but having seen many more hentai series than the people issuing said complaints, I can say that they're nothing new and nothing that hasn't been used before. The Japanese voice acting was sweet and well-delivered, and the soundtrack suited the series very well. Again, well-rounded in all aspects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuffice it to say, Boku no Pico met all the minimum standards in place for hentai, making it a fairly average--perhaps even above average--entry in the world of hentai. In retrospect, I can say with confidence that I've seen many which were much, much worse, somewhat sloppy writing aside. Still, for having a generically sweet storyline, and for making boys cute again (as opposed to all the ugly old bastards I've grown accustomed to seeing in hentai), I wouldn't mind recommending this series to anyone interested in guys and/or shota, vanilla."}, {"id": 610, "score": 30, "body": "The story of young Pico and his homoerotic escapades continues in this second installment of the Boku no Pico series. Hopefully the squeamish people are a moot point by this review, because they won't have sat through episode 1. This one is an entirely distinct story from the first, and doesn't seem to reference it in any way, for better or for worse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n __Story:__ In a nutshell, Pico befriends a boy around his age and teaches him about sex. This episode lacks the conflict-and-resolution structure of the previous, making it a decidedly more Eastern narrative. What isn't really explained is how or why Pico is in this new setting. I have to just assume he's homeless, or some kind of wandering ghost or something. His romantic partner from the previous episode long gone, this one's focus is on two young boys, rather than one young and one not-so-young. Thus, it balances between a sense of childlike innocence and the childlike not-so-innocent. This is kind of what I suspect Gon and Killua do in their free time. ANYWAY, the progression of events feels at least slightly more believable in this episode than it did in the last, and it's much more laid back and slow-moving. I'm sure there are lots of people with childhood stories that share some similarities with this plot (though probably not all of them). Finally, while it's not a significant enough part of the episode to merit watching it just to see, there is some female nudity featured as well, which was entirely absent from the first.\r\n\r\n __Art:__ The art hasn't changed from the previous episode. Still very pretty and bishonen. I will say that the production values in general are a cut above most hentai here.\r\n\r\n __Sound:__ The same goes for sound. The music is surprisingly charming and the theme song cute (if very saccharine), the voices generally well-acted, and overall, no complaints to speak of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would say that this episode was a better entry to the series than the first, simply because the plot wasn't as rushed and character relations/dialogue as unrealistic. It can be interesting to see Pico take the role of dominance that his partner took in the previous episode, as well, in that little bit of reversal. I could easily recommend this to any fans of shota/boy love, but anyone else? Steer clear, and let the fans be fans."}, {"id": 611, "score": 30, "body": "And finally, we come to the third and final installment. Blah blah, gay shota, you've been warned. This episode sees the return of the plotholes and nonsensical story elements seen in the first, but thankfully doesn't suffer from a rushed pace. I would even say, in my opinion, this one is the most interesting of the three, adding a little bit of magic (for lack of a better word) to the mix. Honestly, my ghosts theory is starting to feel closer and closer to the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n __Story:__ Unlike the previous episode, this one relies on characters and events that took place in the one before it, creating a continuity. This episode features a storyline in which Pico and Chico meet a young boy (again mistakenly thought to be a girl) who lives alone in a maintenance area in the subway under the city. He's very knowledgeable about the city and its lore, telling them of \"city fairies\" and how cell phones are really alive and communicate with each other. This gives the story a very different tone at times than its two predecessors, but not an unwelcome one, I think. Don't be misled, though. The content hasn't changed. In fact, the whole thing ends with a boy-on-boy threesome. Who could have seen that coming?\r\n\r\n __Art:__ Not much to say that hasn't been stated in previous reviews. Lovely art, decent animation, above average for a hentai series.\r\n\r\n __Sound:__ Same as above; decent soundtrack, believable voice acting, and no complaints to speak of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTruthfully, I don't think there's much left for me to say about this series (why isn't it a single entry again?). It's cute and pretty, if not the best written, and sets a decent standard for any other gay shota hentai to follow it. You won't get a whole lot watching this for the story, as is the case with most hentai, so I can only really recommend it to those who are attracted by the subject matter. That, or if you want to get a reaction video from your friends. It's amusing at times how hot and bothered people can get by this."}, {"id": 614, "score": 40, "body": "I'm sure this is a nostalgia trip for a lot of people. Me? I never saw, played, or knew anything about Digimon until recently, but part of me wishes I'd discovered it a long time ago. True, it's not a fantastic show on its own merits, and I'm not going to pretend that it is... but in the world of toyetic children's series like Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon, Beyblade, and Yu-Gi-Oh!, the Digimon series does have a certain special quality to it, despite falling victim to the same monster of incredibly edited dubs that claims so many others.\n\n\n\n __Story:__ The plot, as a whole, ranges from arbitrary and childish at worst to confusing and convoluted at best. I don't know how else to describe a story in which God himself ([no joke](http://digimon.wikia.com/wiki/God)) is an involved character. You can't spin a simpler \"good vs. evil\" yarn than that. What's really unusual is how drastically the series changes from beginning to end, starting off in an incredibly generic and formulaic villain-of-the-week format and expanding into a rather intricate narrative. So intricate, in fact, that I don't think the writers themselves knew what they were doing. The plot jumps from one extreme to the other over the course of the series, which is a crazy move in terms of narrative. Maybe that's why I'm just a little bit drawn to it; I like things a little crazy. That said, the last thing you'll hear me call the storyline is thoughtful. As I've said, it's unique, but not much else... and it does sadly suffer from an abundance of plotholes and loose ends. While the actual plot doesn't change much from Japanese to English, the style of writing most certainly does. The English version makes damned sure to insert a bad joke or two anytime things start to get too tense so as to maintain the \"cartoony\" air of the localization... mind you, even with this fact, the story does approach some topics that any other toyetic series would avoid like the plague. While these scenes are more serious/powerful in the Japanese version, I have to say that it's beautiful to see this new ground covered at all in either version. Ash never got smacked upside the head by his mother for nearly killing someone in Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon, I can guarantee you that.\n\n __Art:__ Despite all the competition out there in the \"monster training\" subgenre (remember Monster Rancher?), Digimon actually manages to have a fairly distinct style to its artwork, and not an unattractive one at that. You won't find beautifully immersive character models, photorealistic backdrops or jaw-dropping special effects, of course; I'm just saying the art style is unique and recognizable, and with a series that boasts 50+ episodes to a season, that's not a bad feat. The animation itself ranges from subpar to average, but usually sticks closer to the latter, and isn't uncomfortable to watch.\n\n __Sound:__ I'll confess, the last version I watched was the English, edits and all. By acting alone, it's nothing extraordinary, but it's not particularly bad, either... unless you mind hearing the same actor play fifty roles, in what I call The Sabat Effect. Me, I find it hilarious. But I digress. The Japanese dub is fairly standard and the English passable in terms of voice acting. Despite some localization, the English dub manages to be surprisingly faithful by toyetic standards--hardly any name changes and almost no visual edits. One thing I do have to complain about, however, is the music. As cheesy as the English theme song is, it's nowhere near as bad as the goofy insert songs scattered throughout the dub. Those, sadly, sorely hurt the experience, but are thankfully not present in the Japanese version (which again, I personally recommend in this case).\n\n\n\nTo put it simply, this is one of those series that I find myself conflicted on. As much fun as I have watching it, either for abstract reasons or just because it's so bad it's good, my analysis must remain objective. Simply put, Digimon is not a good show. But it's a bad show that I can't help but have fun watching. Who knows? Maybe the same will be true for you."}, {"id": 624, "score": 40, "body": "<div align=\"justify\">Perhaps it's my intolerance of romance anime in general, but I struggled with  _Ef: A Tale of Memories_. I sincerely wanted to enjoy this and although I must commend SHAFT for conveying human emotions so vividly, after I took a step back to evaluate what was actually happening on the screen in front of me I couldn't help but laugh at the raw absurdity of it all. \n\n _Ef: A Tale of Memories_ is divided into two parallel love stories, which, although loosely related and referential of each other, never actually cross paths. On one hand you've got a love triangle centered around Hiro Hirono, a highschool student despite being a published manga author. He soon meets the outgoing Miyako and a rivalry forms between her and Hiro's childhood friend Kei. The other story is focused on Renji Aso, an aspiring novelist who one day meets a girl called Chihiro. Due to an accident four years ago, Chihiro is unable to remember anything but the events of the last thirteen hours since the age of twelve. Renji soon begins to assist Chihiro in her longtime dream to write a novel.\n\nwebm(https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/7c653c06e6fa6dcc85bc04c36d5c5eb1.webm)\n\nOne of the most striking things about  _Ef: A Tale of Memories_ is how in a genre often confined within the restraints of cliche and normality, the series is refreshingly unique in style and construction. It takes seemingly simple scenarios such as the love-triangle and presents them in a whole new angle, accompanied by incredible emotional flair that really packs a punch. The driving force behind this emotional impact is the unusual complexity of the series' characters, however, this is also where things start to go wayward. \n\nUnderstanding the psyche behind each of these characters reveals a surprising amount of intricacy and initially, realistic humanism. Hiro, who is also my personal favorite character, is torn between pursuing his tenuous line of work and focusing on his more stagnant school career. He is, however, unable to make a decision and it is this indecisiveness which proves to be his greatest obstacle. Miyako represents the option of devoting himself as a manga artist, the freedom to do what he truly desires, but behind her outgoing and seductive front she is in actuality a confused and lonely girl, driven by selfish desires due to a tragic background. Kei is the safer option, where although she appears to be a control freak she is in fact fueled by a guilt-ridden sense of responsibility and compassion due to, well, once again, a tragic back story. Renji is similar to Hiro in the sense that he doesn't know where to go, he's lost and directionless, that is until he meets Chihiro who suddenly gives purpose to his life. Chihiro struggles on a daily basis to come to terms with a lifestyle that she believes renders her identity and existence an empty one. She feels confined by her handicap, unable to progress, and like Renji, unable to find any meaning. \n\n~~~img320(http://adtrwiki.com/images/8/8d/04_l.jpg)~~~\n\nDeep, right?\n\nIt really is. Unfortunately, this impressive depth is completely smothered by how hyperbolic these characters end up becoming. In the show's efforts to convey the emotions which its characters are experiencing, the characters end up being defined not by their motivations but rather by their incredibly outlandish actions. Miyako and Kei end up devolving into some of the most obsessive, incomprehensible and plain detestable women I've ever seen- seriously, bitches be crazy. And although I understand the intent behind the exaggeration, where the lengths in which they go to are to demonstrate the intensity of their feelings, these feelings are ultimately overwhelmed by the sheer ludicrousness of what these girls are actually doing. As such, what we end up with aren't the complex characters initially implied but rather melodramatic caricatures.\n\n~~~img320(http://adtrwiki.com/images/5/5a/Ef_.jpg)~~~\n\nIt is this melodrama which ultimately drowns the series. Everyone (perhaps excluding Hiro) seems like they're constantly PMSing. We have characters on their knees howling at the moon, people constantly tripping as they run feeling betrayed and distraught, a monsoon of tears and stacks of shattered plates. It gets a bit ridiculous. And once again, although I understood what the producers were going for with the whole concept of 'intense melodrama = intense emotions' (and admittedly, it succeeds to an extent), it becomes overwhelming. Our very real characters with very human flaws become distorted and inflated by the stupidity of their actions and what they say, and as such become harder and harder to sympathize with. One could argue that their irrationality shows how deeply twisted and distraught they are, I think it's got more to do with lazy writing analogous to that of a Korean drama. As a result, some of the most intense scenes end up becoming some of the most unintentionally laughable and embarrassing. I can't help but feel it's a bit contrived at times, especially when you have two men having a deep and meaningful discussion on a Church rooftop (seriously, isn't that a bit dangerous?)\n\nFor all its depth and complexity,  _Ef_ is lacking in any subtlety. It's not handled with nuance but rather with extravagance, and consequently everything is blown out of proportion to the point where it becomes obnoxious. There's so much illogical crying and screaming and smashing of fragile objects that although this cacophony of noise conveys a cacophony of emotion, it ends up being rather silly. \n\n~~~img320(https://38.media.tumblr.com/925a162b3dc1b507290377a228e1bbf1/tumblr_middai12Qa1rizsxoo1_500.gif)\n~~~\nThe visuals very much complements this sentiment. SHAFT's/Shinbo's stylistic individualism really shines through here, and the intensity and passion of the feelings of the series' characters is represented through a range of vivid imagery. Bizarre camera shots, framing and symbolism really communicates emotion in an effective manner. Something as simple as a harsh red dominating the shot to a black and white scene often ends up being drastically more effective at conveying emotion than through the dialogue and actions of the characters, and with far stronger of an impact as well. \n\nOnce again though, the imagery is at times overwhelmed by the sheer ridiculousness of it all. Some motifs are just so absurd and overused that it's cringe-worthy (I'm talking about you, paper-airplanes). Although for the most past the visual style is brilliant, it sometimes ends up trying to being too deep when it really isn't.  \n\nThe soundtrack is characterized by a heavy emphasis on piano and violin to reinforce the mood. The opening song,  _Euphoric Field_, is downright amazing, where the mounting passion in the vocals really reflects the same amount of passion the show tries to communicate (and ends up overdoing). \n\n~~~youtube(Uo5rQnLLoPw)\n~~~\nPacing can get sluggish at times, and the intense melodrama can make important moments seem plain boring, although it picks up during the latter third. Also, as to be expected there's a lot of talking.\n\nAlthough Ef: A Tale of Memories has a strong foundation with intriguing characters and vivid pathos, the intensity of it all soon becomes too overwhelming. The melodrama does work at times, and there are some genuinely endearing moments, but for the most part, I can't help but wonder if it realizes how ridiculous it's being. The series tries too hard, tries to convey too much through the irrational dialogue and actions of its characters and its unique but sometimes overworked imagery. I can see why this might appeal to many people, but for me, the complete absence of any subtlety, any attempted nuance leaves me severely disappointed with what was really so much squandered potential.\n\nIf you're into romances chances are you'll like this. If not, well, if you can ignore the absurdity of it all, maybe you'll be more satisfied than I was."}, {"id": 653, "score": 15, "body": "A young boy, in order to pay off debts his parents owe, is forced into crossdressing by a perverted student council. That is the premise of Himegoto, so no one was expecting it to be a masterpiece. Those who hear of the premise will probably fall into one of two camps. One group will roll their eyes and say \"I'm not giving that piece of shit the time of day,\" and the other half will eagerly say \"this sounds absolutely terrible and I'm going to love every raunchy, shameless, stupid second of it.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, even those who would choose to enjoy Himegoto ironically will be sorely disappointed, and this is coming from someone who has a soft spot for absolutely terrible anime. Himegoto strives for that over-the-top blatant stupidity one finds in many ecchi shows but fails even at that. It tries so hard to be shocking and scandalous that all jokes are blatantly telegraphed, predictable, and repetitive. All the humor in the show boils down to \"there's a penis under those clothes\" episode after episode. On top of that, despite their silly names, all the characters are entirely forgettable. I wish I could say that the plot makes up for it, but as a gag show, there is no plot. It's just a series of scenarios strung together by a concept. It's unfair to deduct marks for storytelling because of that, since gag shows rely on characters and jokes instead. So if we look at--oh, wait, we already did look at those and they were both shit.\r\n\r\nThere are only two redeeming qualities of Himegoto. The first is how explicit it gets, content-wise. Our crossdressing male characters (yes, there's more than one) will occasionally have their nipples exposed and even show visible bulges. Wow! What a bold move! It's a shame that it's a shock that only works once. In subsequent appearances, viewers will merely be wondering what excuse the show will come up with this week to display the characters' 8-balls and pool cues. The other saving grace of Himegoto is that, at thirteen episodes of four minutes each, it's not a long watch. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time, but if you do decide not to take my word about how tedious it is and give it a shot anyway, you'll waste less than an hour of your life on it.\r\n\r\nYou might think that audacious imagery and short length don't exactly sound like selling points. This is only because they aren't. If those are the only good things I can find to say about the show, what exactly does that say about the show?  I'll answer my own rhetorical question: it says that the show is bad. It's not even a piece of shit, because that implies that one could feel anger or strong emotion toward it, which would have given it at least some appeal. Instead, it's wholly uninteresting. If the show had been more blatantly worse, it would have actually paradoxically been better. At least then it'd be fun to make fun of. But no, it is instead just thoroughly unenjoyable. It's just...bad. Wasn't worth my time. Won't be worth your time.

Well, look no further, because _Psycho-Pass 2_ looks to answer that exact question!\n\n_Psycho-Pass_ was a fantastic dystopian cyberpunk story. It made frequent (almost too frequent) allusions to great works of literature and philosophy, then explored those ideas in a technologically automated world. It was frequently dark, but the darkness was always to make a certain point. It had a variety of arcs, each emphasizing a different idea or theme, but all leading to a greater conclusion. The nuanced characters were also a selling point for me. In an industry where most shows play it safe by writing archetypes rather than actual characters, _Psycho-Pass_'s leads felt like a breath of fresh air.\n\n_Psycho-Pass 2_, however, seems to miss the point of all that. Instead of basing the story around ideas that the world would raise, it attempts to manufacture the first season with new material. While I give the season props for at least understanding the formula of the first season (i.e., separate arcs focusing on an idea that ties into the villain's philosophies), the ideas it explores are all the same basic idea clumsily done in different ways, and when the arcs all finally do come together, it turns out that the concept they're based on is itself clumsy. \n\nThe second season is so concerned with trying to replicate the first season that it completely ignores the world and the characters, investing all its energy into a premise that is itself flawed. Said premise--a variation of the omnipotence paradox--could have made an interesting story. The question \"can an all-judging entity judge itself\" is one worth asking, but the ideas explored in the first season should have already answered the question with \"it doesn't need to because it is above judgment.\" Worse, in attempting to answer the question, the show directly contradicts certain elements of the first season, such as how the Sibyl System functions or what \"criminally asymptomatic\" means.\n\nIn addition, _Psycho-Pass 2_ seems to flat-out miss the point at times. When the first season contained gore, it was usually to demonstrate a point, such as how depraved a certain individuals inner desires were. Most of the gore in the second season is there for shock value and is violence for the sake of violence.\n\nFinally, let's talk briefly about the characters. The old characters in _Psycho-Pass 2_ are used with reservation, likely because the upcoming film meant they couldn't be drastically changed. The new characters fall anywhere from uninteresting to offensively bad. I wish I was not able to say that there was more than one character whose entire existence ceased to make sense once their backstory was revealed. But no, the characters either fail to engage or engage on a level that provides negative results.\n\nOf course, there's plenty of action and violence and a storyline that seems like it's deep and engaging to those who don't know any better. I'd recommend it to people who like _Elfen Lied_ or _Tokyo Ghoul_, or those who liked _Psycho-Pass_ for the wrong reasons (i.e., it's got violence and cool science fiction stuff in it). To anyone who likes to be engaged on a more meaningful level, though, skip it. Please. It will only succeed in insulting your intelligence and giving you _Darker than Black 2_ levels of disappointment.

The story makes it clear from the very start that it is serious, and that it has a high potential. It gives off a light-hearted feeling, only to reveal itself as something tragic. It deals with problems such as traumatic experiences, child abuse, and more. But what is so compelling about Your Lie in April, is how they portrayed these problems. They portrayed them truthfully. They showed that these problems have a long-lasting effect and that they are very difficult to get rid off. For the characters in this story, music is their remedy. It is like the beating of their heart, the very thing that resonates who they are.

Tone shifts is one of the those flaws. This was evident in the fact that comedy scenes were often misplaced. Any misplacement or an imperfect switch of tone can ruin a scene. It is a common trait amongst shows today, and it can be quite cringey or even annoying. In fact, they should have just left out the comedy and melodrama in order to build on the premise that they introduced in the beginning. The performances would have also been better without monologue. We seriously didn't need to know what the audience was thinking every single time. As this anime progresses, it starts becoming repetitive with its continuous symbolism and foreshadowing. The ending is one that many people may like, but the overall quality of the story just drops and ends up becoming mediocre. Many sides to the plot were left untouched, but at the same time, there were also things that should have been left untouched, such as the case with the Tsubaki character arc. Finding inspiration through music, and the relationship between Kaori and Kousei were two great things about this show.

With an added flair, the musical performances became surreal, so much so, that it can even sometimes give you goosebumps. From the monotone world of Arima, to the colorful world of Kaori, the transitioning of the animations from lively moments to dull gave a feeling of realism.\n\n~~~img320(https://49.media.tumblr.com/605b35df5d7a65a4d16e67d67a628d22/tumblr_o57irh9TFn1vqic7go2_500.gif) img320(https://78.media.tumblr.com/e510c73ce4d7610fe7346b3db07c8062/tumblr_p18ef2vTav1twgfw0o2_500.gif) img320(https://78.media.tumblr.com/7344806d23718f43d11fd9c9d9e02501/tumblr_okhwnm05kB1vgh64ho1_500.gif) img320(https://78.media.tumblr.com/626efce1f430291a7d5d7e4404591c01/tumblr_osv4z7z2TD1tfm2f3o1_1280.gif) img320(https://78.media.tumblr.com/947234886fc2c13f0cee81127eca3126/tumblr_p1bnryQ1RB1u7gyjmo4_500.gif) img320(https://78.media.tumblr.com/72c8e4d3307ec0cc7bd52606f31a15d9/tumblr_osv4z7z2TD1tfm2f3o3_500.gif) ~~~\n\n<hr style=\"height:3px; border:none; color:rgb(60,90,180); background-color:rgb(60,90,180);\">\n\n__Sound and Music:__\nNot an episode went by that I didn't listen to the OP and ED in this anime.

They made them 14 year-olds in order to appeal to the audience, but I honestly think that they should have upped the age. Second, the only characters that were fully fleshed out were Kousei and Kaori. Although it could have taken more episodes for more character development, it was disconcerting to know that the rest of the characters were just basically tossed off by the end of the story. The time given for the supporting characters was pointless because they did not serve any purpose by the end of the story. Introducing more characters by the second half of the show did not help either. If they were just gonna toss all of the supporting characters off, then they should have just focused solely on Kousei and Kaori."}, {"id": 675, "score": 40, "body": "__Minor spoilers. __\n\n__Disclaimer: I have limited knowledge of the Fate-universe so this will be apparent in my review.__\n\n\nSense of place. The term can be used in many different ways. For some it may be unique places like ones bedroom, for others it may be about an attachment to a group of people where one feels safe and free to express oneself. We all seek a place to belong, somewhere where warmth emits. Some are lucky to find attachment early during their childhood while others struggle to. When you do not find a place, you feel left outside, alone, scared, cold and that is when one is the weakest and perhaps most aggressive; acting with hostility towards those who have taken your comfortable place out of frustration and fear. \n\n2wei! is a story about finding a place to belong.\n\nThe sequel to Fate/kaleid liner Prisma\u00e2\u0098\u0086Illya, Fate/kaleid liner Prisma\u00e2\u0098\u0086Illya 2wei! continues the journey of the two girls, Illyasviel and Miyu. After completing the task of collecting the class cards, Illya and Miyu adjusts to live their life normally after the events. But that does not last long since there is trouble brewing in the complex space. Illya and Miyu are once again needed by Rin and Luvia to deal with the side effects left by the cards. Following the restoration we are introduced to Kuro, the new addition of the story.\n\nBeing reminded that others have a normal life does take a toll on one's self confidence and balance, and this is what happens to Kuro. With Illya being surrounded by friends and family, Kuro is constantly reminded of what she lacks. When Illya expresses that she wants her life to return to normal it triggers Kuro making her loathe Illya all the more. Even though surrounded with demoralizing scenes she tries to find a place by taking advantage of Illya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s desires (which Illya is not able to act on because of fear) and attempts to push her out and replace her. This is shown when she advances towards Shirou (who Illya holds a dear crush for) and being sexually suggestive while flirting with him. Her attempts on phasing Illya out eventually ends with a fight and it being interrupted with perfect timing (a bit too appropriately) by a third party, the source of Kuro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s problem itself. As the show progresses the influence of Illya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continuous friendly advances leads to Kuro being able to find a place in her former enemy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s warmth. Although minor, Miyu plays a role in the story when Kuro challenges the validity of her friendship with Illya which Miyu responds with a strong resolve, and it shows that Miyu has developed during the course of the series.\n\nEven though they had the first season to reflect and improve their show, 2wei! is sadly not an improvement over the first season and the series is faltering.\n\nThe themes of friendship and trust that was dealt with in the previous season are now shifted away to give way to the new theme, a place of belonging. Early on the show loses focus on the themes it attempts to deal with. Episodes leading up to the climax favors comedic events spawned from Kuro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interactions and these events take too much time of the shows constricting episode count. Episode 4 being the biggest offender with it being about a game of dodgeball which is dragged out to the point that would make a taffy confectioner jealous. The dodgeball game serves little purpose in the narrative with its intentions being about eliciting chuckles and to mystify Miyu and the school nurse, perhaps hinting the upcoming events of the series.\n\nThe theme is vaguely hinted throughout the story from Kuro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hostile and apathetic actions towards others, and her reaction from Illya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s questioning about her reason to remove Illya out of the way. It is later clarified why Kuro acted the way she did, but it does not leave a satisfying conclusion. There is a sharp contrast with how light and playful the the story was compared to the event leading up to the climax, and the bridge leading up to it gives little time to empathize with Kuro. With these reasons the climax did not reach its full potential and in the end falls flat.\n\nAlthough humor is a part of the series, anything but the interactions between the main characters are so weak that they detract time only to attempt a flat and dull gag. It also feels artificial and forced. The shows side characters are significantly degrading ones experience, to the extent that you cannot enjoy the show whenever they pop-up. Tatsuko being the energetic and feisty troublemaker, Suzuhana the mature one, Nanaki the one who just goes along with anything and Mimi the one with lacking presence. They are all simplified, fitting common tropes and serve to share the burden of the main cast to supply amusement. This shows a lack of trust given to the main characters ability to elicit laughter. The memorable and great moments of fun are risen naturally from the main characters interactions.\n\nOne side character to note is Shirou, that lacks any purpose in the story other than to make the main characters, as well as Rin and Luvia, lose control and behave out of character. Two notable scenes are when Miyu clings to Shirou like a vulnerable puppy and scuttles away, and Rin and Luvia trying their best to look impress and get his attention. It feels out of place and is one of the downsides with the show. The influence he has on the girls and their feelings for him feels out of place whenever they are in the same scene. We are never explained why the girls feel the way they do towards him, and it does not have any impact at all. It just gives rise to an awkward and confusing scene. It also gives a sense of a subplot being that the girls are a part of a harem romcom with Shirou being the typical dull and oblivious main character.\n\nAlthough flawed, the series is enjoyable to a certain degree. The interactions between the characters does spawn great moments of comedy; in particular, the way Illya reacted and her face when she was seen by her classmates in her magical girl outfit is one the funniest parts of the show. The scene in episode 2 where Kuro explores the mysteries of Miyu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth might be weird to watch, but it sure offers a kind of fan service that is tasteful without detracting the characters to simple sexual objects. How the camera angles during that scene showing Illya in the background with the two girls kissing in the forefront and the fact that the camera lingers shortly close to them and quickly backs away to give them space gives the idea of the camera respecting their moment. The way Illya observed them during that scene reflects perfectly how I reacted to it, and it shows that the producer knows its audience and what reaction they expect. Interestingly enough there is a reason behind Kuro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kissing, however it is not convincing enough to pass it off since there are other ways she can recharge her mana which does not require her to force herself onto other girls.\n\nIt is also a pleasure to see how Kuro slowly warms up to the rest of the cast as the show goes on. The antagonist that is introduced later in the second half ramps up the girls relationship. The battle that follows shows how well the CGI complements the action that is displayed. The animation of the characters are well done and smooth, and it does not detract the exhilarating action. In contrast to the light and bright scenes in the first half of the show, the dark arc in the end fits well since it serves to strengthen the girls bond by inserting a common enemy which they will have to work as a team in order to defeat it. This allows the girls develop their characters even further, and gives Miyu, Rin and Luvia some needed screen time.\n\nIllya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character design has never looked this good before, making other works design of her look poor in comparison. Miyu and Kuro are no exception to the lovely design as well. Silver Link\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strength regarding animation are character design and CGi, and they sure do know how to draw characters with a great consistency. The shows CGI looks amazing with its natural presence unlike other shows which feature CGi that looks out of place. The lighting applied to the scene are nicely represented, and the shadows covers and wraps around the objects and characters they are on decently giving a decent overall look. Other than the CGI, the overall animation quality is decent The soundtrack and background music does not impress. It does its job, but being simple regarding synths and tunes, as well as the background music during the fight scenes feeling more like a dance than action pumping sound it leaves one unfulfilled. There are not any notable or memorable soundtracks. At least the ending song is nice, fitting well into the shows light and magical feel with its instruments sounding very light and giving a cheery and girly overall sense.\n\n\n__OP:__ youtube(z3DtDuRKuk8)\n\n__ED:__ youtube(8vk4goYHbF0)\n\nSometimes there are shows that pop up which are incredibly popular with the help of it being a part of a popular franchise or something else. Prisma\u00e2\u0098\u0086Illya is one of those shows, risen to heights with the help of the Fate-franchise immense popularity. Even though mediocre, it offers fans of the Fate-franchise a mahou shoujo spin-off with the ever so popular girl, Illyasviel.\n\nCute girls in cute outfits is what Prisma\u00e2\u0098\u0086Illya is all about. With a heavy sprinkle of magic, friendship and acceptance it paints itself like any other generic Mahou Shoujo but within the Fate universe. Although the show handles itself decently at some aspects its dynamic between philosophy and humor falters, and it offers nothing new and should be treated as nothing more but sugar. For the fans of Illya, I suggest hopping onto this series since Illya has never before been more beautiful and cute. She looks lovely but the shows she stars in are anything but."}, {"id": 683, "score": 5, "body": "Due to what are apparently masochistic tendencies, I've subjected myself to a lot of bad anime. This got me thinking. I asked myself \"what is the worst anime I've ever seen?\" I thought this over for a few moments, and gave myself this answer: \"Elfen Lied. Elfen Lied is the worst anime I've ever seen.\"\n\nElfen Lied is essentially about monster girls with psychic powers behaving violently in response to humans being shit. One monster girl tries escaping and actually manages to succeed, but loses her memory in the process, reducing her to a vegetable who only goes \"Nyu!\" She winds up in the care of a boy and his female cousin, whose names I've forgotten and can't be assed to look up.\n\nThere are a few things to like about Elfen Lied. The first is the soundtrack. By this, I mean that there's a good song (used for the OP) that is repeated through the soundtrack ad nauseum in slightly different ways. The second is the potential it had. There were a few themes that could have been fairly solid. But we'll get to those when we talk about what was bad. Which happens to be now!\n\nAny good of Elfen Lied is far outweighed by what's bad. I could be wrong since I don't really have an eye for animation or direction, but I don't remember it being particularly impressive. In fact, I think I remember laughing at how poorly things were animated at a few points. The English voice acting is lackluster, even by dub standards, and I've heard the Japanese acting isn't all that impressive either. Maybe not bad, but certainly not any points in the show's favor. Let's talk about things I can more definitively say are bad.\n\nI hate to throw around buzzwords, but I can't think of a way to describe Elfen Lied's shortcomings without saying that it tries way too hard to be edgy. There is plenty of gratuitous violence, gore, and nudity, as well as themes relating to the darkness of human nature. It is possible for these elements to make a show good. Elfen Lied, however, utterly fails on that account. It assumes that these things are inherently good, so it makes no further effort. There are many stories in various forms of media that have combined sex and violence in ways that make both more appealing. Elfen Lied seems to be vaguely aware of this idea and has tried to emulate it to ill effect. Instead of having these two elements emphasize each other, they are simply thrown together so that hey both exist. The result is that they cancel each other out. The nudity makes the violence ridiculous, and the gore makes the nudity unsexy.\n\nWorse than that is the theme, which weaves through the plot. Elfen Lied is about monster girls called Diclonii who can kill people with their brains. The government experiments on these Diclonii, because humans are scumbags. This bit is important, we'll come back to it later. One Diclonius, named Lucy, attempts to escape. She succeeds, brutally murdering half the facility in the process, but a sniper shoots her in the head. Not fatally, mind you. Only enough to give her brain damage, because the plot requires that she become literally retarded for a while in order to work. She is found and taken in by a boy named Kohta and his female cousin Yuka.\n\nThe government is not fond of Lucy escaping and murdering, so they send a bunch of Diclonius after her. Her murderous side conveniently reemerges when she is in danger. As the series progresses, the government continues to try to bring Lucy down, while flashbacks slowly reveal Lucy's past. Spoilers follow:\n\n~!It is revealed that, as a child, Lucy was bullied for being a Diclonius. We see a scene in an orphanage where, after Lucy makes friends with a puppy, a bunch of children beat it to death in front of her. She then uses her mind-explodey powers and reduces them to strawberry jam. Later, it turns out that Lucy and Khota ended up meeting each other, and he was about the only human who was ever nice to her. Then, one day, Khota's like \"Sorry, can't hang out with you today. I've made plans with my cousin to go to a festival\" and Lucy's all \"Is this cousin a boy or a girl?\" and for whatever reason, Khota lies and says that she's a boy. Lucy finds out about the lie and murders Khota's father and sister in revenge. Because even as a child she wanted his dick and was apparently terrified that he'd fall for a blood relative instead of her. Though in fairness, he and his cousin totally do start falling for each other over the course of the season, because incest is edgy and that's how Elfen Lied rolls.!~\n\nUltimately, the series hammers in how much life sucked for Lucy and how horribly everyone always treated her, and how that turned her into a murderous monster. Because humans are trash, you see. We're cruel to anything that's different from us. This on its own isn't an inherently bad idea to explore. There are plenty of ways it can be handled well. But once again, Elfen Lied fails on that front. Instead of showing realistic human cruelty, it subjects us to the most blatant, over-the-top, cartoon villain evil it can find. Men abusing women isn't funny, but when a man randomly backhands a woman in an early episode, entirely unprovoked, I can't help but laugh. It's such a hamfisted way of attempting to show that a character is evil. There were so many times that I didn't know whether I should be laughing or whether I should just be disgusted at how much Elfen Lied was insulting my intelligence. There's making a point, and then there's flat-out misanthropy. Guess which side of that line Elfen Lied is on?\n\nElfen Lied is an anime that not only failed to do anything correctly, it flat-out insulted my intelligence and insulted me as a person by implicating that, as a human being, I was terrible simply for existing. Maybe, in the hands of someone more talented, Elfen Lied could have become an average series. If that were the case, it would have at least had the decency to be forgettable. But no, it decided that if it couldn't achieve greatness, it would at least manage to succeed at being terrible enough to be remembered, dammit! And the worst part is, because this was one of the first \"edgy\" anime to gain relative success in the West, there are a lot of people who are actually under the mistaken impression that this is good. It's not. Worst anime I've seen.

And, when done correctly, can be both an infinitely frustrating yet infinitely gratifying experience. Unfortunately, _Rokka no Yuusha_ was far more of the former than the latter. \n\n~~~img320(http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2015/07/rokka_1-720x403.jpg)~~~\n\nA demon god has been resurrected and is threatening to destroy the world. As with each time this apocalyptic threat has occurred in the past (you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d think that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have thought of a more permanent solution by this stage), six mighty heroes have been chosen to save the world. Among those selected is our protagonist: a charismatic, artful, and dare I say _foxy_ young man specially trained to dispatch of fiends and other demon-nasties; the \u00e2\u0080\u0098strongest man in the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099, Adlet Mayer. The only problem is, when Adlet and the rest of the gang gather, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seven of them. We have an imposter on our hands! And, given the circumstances, Adlet is the group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prime suspect. \n\nThe key to any good story, but perhaps more so for something which aims to be as immersive as a whodunit, is to treat the audience with the respect. Greats of the genre such as Agatha Christie and Rex Stout did just this: the crime is set, we are given the clues and maybe a couple of red herrings along the way, but in the end, whether we successfully solve the mystery or not, we are satisfied with a well thought-out, reasonable and comprehensive ending. \n\n~~~webm(https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/f331598e3a3aab20c0759a0512d6ed54.mp4)~~~\n\nBy _Rokka no Yuusha_\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conclusion, however, I did not feel as satisfied as I did insulted. The flaws of the series are diverse, but the fatal failing lies in the construction of the mystery itself. \n\nThe actual structuring of the series was the first problem. The actual mystery isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t introduced until the end of the fourth episode (in a twelve episodes series). Up till that point, we had some pretty average world-building and exposition and were introduced to four of our potential impostors, including Adlet. One of these characters wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t given nearly as much screen time, backstory or development as the other three were. To put it simply, he was one-dimensional. Like, seriously \u00e2\u0080\u0093 his single defining character trait is his loyalty/love-borderline-possessiveness of another character. And this is an issue with the three remaining characters introduced post-episode four: they simply aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as fleshed out as what is our primary trio, mainly due to their relative lack of screen time. \n\nWhat we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re left with is a couple of semi-interesting characters and a bunch of bland archetypes. Consequently, we as the audience are quickly able to eliminate majority of the cast from suspicion, simply due to their lacklustre characterisations. In fact, I found myself trying to decide between two of the suspects for most of the series.\n\n~~~img320(http://pm1.narvii.com/5827/ef58be107f4939776281edced89a608bde0ae6bc_hq.jpg)~~~\n\nThe second problem was the actual reveal. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t surprising at all, especially given the aforementioned formatting of the series and the inequality of screen time allocation given to the various characters. In fact, it was nearly too simple. But that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t my primary gripe. Nor was the ridiculous, deus ex machina-esque clue that catalysed the resolution \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it was so far-fetched that you literally need a degree in meteorology to even have a chance at identifying it. \n\nRather, it was the motivations of the perpetrator. A plot twist is a common device in whodunits. Except, _Rokka no Yuusha_\u00e2\u0080\u0099s big twist was as ludicrous, arbitrary and down-right stupid as something from an M. Night Shyamalan movie. In fact, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly what it felt like. A character does a near 180-degree reversal and we learn things about him/her that come straight outta left field. \n\nThe resolution was as dumbfounding as it was ridiculous. You might even find it laughable. But, all things considered, it was insulting.\n\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also an equally frustrating and ludicrous ending post-the big reveal that sets things up for a sequel, but for all intents and purposes, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just going to ignore it. \n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unfortunate, because in spite of the easily dismissible characters and asspulls near the conclusion, the mystery element was fun. The various clues, red-herrings and logical conundrums posed, for the most part, all lend themselves to continuously peak the curiosity and engagement of the viewer. The suspense was aptly maintained, largely due to the cliff-hangers that every episode would finish on. \n\n~~~img320(http://cdn.myanimelist.net/s/common/uploaded_files/1441827189-7f6f9e55654d0bf2dbf6567504c2554d.png)~~~\n\nAs mentioned, the characters are a definite weakness of the series. Apart from Adlet, whose charisma alone makes up for his rather clich\u00c3\u00a9 tragic backstory, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really care much for any of the characters. Other than a couple of nuances here and there, the vast majority of the cast were cardboard cut-outs, and some were just plain despicable. As such, whilst the suspense in the series is superb, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no real tension in the action sequences as none of the characters make an emotional impact. That, and plot armour.\n\nWhich was another issue. The series had a difficult time choosing if it was a whodunit or a fantasy action series. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say the two have to be mutually exclusive. Only, the action sequences didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really add anything to the series, and if anything, detracted from time that could have been spent forging better-rounded, developed characters, thereby elevating the mystery aspect.\n\n~~~webm(https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/212d87350ef0e08de9b0d8e1042f5fa4.webm)~~~\n\nThe inconsistent animation quality didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help either. The budget limitations were distractingly obvious at times \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as in, it occasionally looked really awful. The CG fiends were plain ugly. The ancient Mesoamerican setting, whilst intriguing at first, quickly lost its appeal as the setting stagnated and we were treated to the same background-types over and over again. Namely, jungle and the interior of a temple. Character designs were pretty cool though. \n\nThe soundtrack was okay, if a little uninspired. \n\n~~~youtube(NBxFQkLWSg0)~~~\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a shame, really. _Rokka no Yuusha_ was, for the most part, a fun, engaging, suspenseful watch. The issue is it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t treat itself or the audience with intelligence. Poorly thought-out episode formatting, bland characters and a farcical conclusion make this an asinine series - which is the last thing you want a whodunit to be. That said, if you can ignore the pure doltishness the show eventually degrades itself to, you might end up enjoying _Rokka no Yuusha_ a lot more than I did."}, {"id": 888, "score": 15, "body": "This show is an absolute clusterfuck.\n\nKanojo ga Flag wo Oraretara, or If Her Flag Breaks, is a 2014 anime about a boy named Souta Hatate who can see flags. It is properly abbreviated as \"gaworare,\" but I'm going to call it KanoFlag because I never bothered learning the proper abbreviation when it aired so I'm sure as hell not going to bother using it now.\n\nKanoFlag belongs to an increasingly common subgenre of the harem that I like to call \"gimmick harem.\" Like other harems, it has a notable cast of girls, most of whom have at least some sort of vaguely romantic interest in the generic male protagonist, but instead of being based around wacky fanservice hijinks, the show focuses on some novel, out-there idea. [Noucome](http://anilist.co/anime/19221), for example, where the protagonist deals with being forced to make difficult decisions. [Invaders of the Rokujouma ](http://anilist.co/anime/20638/InvadersoftheRokujoma)is another, this one centered around all the characters fighting for room in the apartment. Most of these are adaptations of light novels, and presumably because the writers wanted to write harems but didn't know how to do fanservice in text form, they are almost entirely devoid of actual ecchi material--which as I'm sure you all know, is a large part of the reason you'd want to watch a harem in the first place. It's a terrible genre, and KanoFlag is one of the worst examples of it that I've seen.\n\nKanoFlag's gimmick is that Souta can see flags, presumably referring to event flags, and knows how to break or advance them. This ends up being a vague power that the writers seem to have no idea how to handle consistently. Sometimes flags are things like romance flags or death flags. I can get that. But when you include things like a flag denoting the direction a character is going to kick a ball, or have flags he can't break or that respond differently to being broken, things become a lot more convoluted. It's either the most OP thing ever, or it's completely useless.\n\nThe plot seems to aim for complex, but it only manages to hit other adjectives starting with C: complicated, convoluted, and confusing. I've watched this show twice (for some reason) and I still haven't quite managed to grasp the plot, which seems to have something to do with an old king and a guy becoming a flag. It really doesn't help that the show paces the plot in a horrendous way, alternating between episodes packed with nothing but generic harem fluff and episodes where all the exposition happens at once. And the plot it tries to focus on is pretty heavy, too, so the tone of the show ends up getting whipped around, snapping back and forth like a flag fluttering in the violent wind. At the end of the show, they go to an alternate reality, everyone turns into a D&D class, and they fight a boat.\n\nThen, of course, there are the characters. This show has some of the blandest, least interesting characters I've seen in anime, and it has a _lot_ of them. The harem has over a dozen members by the end, in fact. Keep in mind that this is only a 12-episode show, meaning that the show is absolutely bloated with these boring, bland faces with unmemorable character designs. With so many characters and with a convoluted plot to cram into such a short space, they receive almost no development and remain generic archetypes. In fact, they fail to even live up to the standards of most generic archetypes, instead feeling more like tokens. You have the token onee-chan, the token tsundere, the token trap, the token robot girl, etc. No one develops past that. They just stay a sea of boring, redundant faces.\n\nI honestly don't know why I stuck with this show to the end, despite being able to tell it was so bad from early on. There were only two things I actually liked about this show, and that's Megumu and when they went \"gao, gawo!\" at the end of every episode. Don't watch this show. I don't know how anyone could actually enjoy it, especially when there are better alternatives. It's dumb. Just...don't do it.

Hasn't provided me enough material to overturn my judgement yet about it being good sooo.. I guess it was.\n\nGrimgar of Fantasy and Ash while it seemed like a good watch at the time, when I finally started the series it left me severely disappointed. While the concept of being stuck in a fantasy world seemed interesting, I haven't seen much of this\"Fantasy\" or \"World\" in that matter to make me not gouge my eyes out because of sheer boredom. The story line hasn't even begun developing, the characters themselves I find have little development, the action while it's enough to leave me satisfied makes me yearn for something more, and the adventure I was promised (if there was any) is barely there. I did find a redeeming quality to the anime in the form of its art and animation. The fight scenes were beautifully done making me excited for more of them, especially during the 1st episode, and the artwork's style literally made me pause the episode just to view its glory.\n\nNow Let me explain my thoughts:\n\n1. The \"Fantasy\" - Of course I'm not blind to ignore the magic or the magical creatures (which apparently only consists of a single goblin (hallowed be thy name) or its friends) besides that there hasn't been any other fantasy elements to truly pique my intrigue towards this anime. I haven't seen any mystical, strange, or even outrageously stupid elements which I would like to see or even any different creatures or races in the world they're in. Likewise the different classes of the characters, outside of the occasional spell (which from what I've seen only consists of the same single spell) I would've liked to see any particular special skill (especially a magical or one with a single fantasy element) that's been granted to the characters due to their class. But as far as I know, all they know is basic physical skills that they constantly repeat and a single special class skill from the Dark Knight class that they touched upon but never elaborated. This lack of a fantasy element truly makes me doubt if the anime should be labeled \"Fantasy\" instead of just \"Magical\" (if even).\n\n2. The \"World\"/Adventure/Action - I was deeply disappointed by the lack of adventure seen in this anime. I personally define \"Adventure\" as going out, exploring the world, and participating in many different events. In Grimgar, I haven't seen even the slightest inclination towards the characters even going on an adventure. Firstly they haven't even left the bloody town where they started in and venture out more than 10ft away besides them just going to the forest, where they get their butts handed to them by a single goblin (hallowed be thy name). Secondly, all I have seen them do is sit on their butts all day sitting around something and eating food. Which tells me nothing is going to happen for a very very very long time or in layman's terms, they ain't going to do shit. Mixed in with this lack of adventure is the lack of the \"world\" that they currently exist in. No special land forms, monuments, or even a distinct architecture type that tells me they now reside in a different world instead of their previous human world. Even the lack of new creatures, people, races, and new ideas haven't been touched upon in the anime which would've made me very excited to see. I would've loved for more exploration of the world of Grimgar that's currently full of possibilities due to it being \"fantasy\" world, but alas my dreams and desires have not been fulfilled.\nAlthough the action is beautifully animated, the action itself leaves a lot to be desired. The amount of action is few in number and some of it can even can be considered redundant. Why do I consider it redundant you say? Well the characters have shown me a sort of functional fixedness where they keep using their weapons the same way (technique-wise) expecting a different result. Yes, I know I'm being harsh because they're relatively new to this world and haven't completely grasped the concept of professional combat. But, they have been taught by mentors of their own respective classes which means they have a lot more skills in their repertoire. I would love to see these skills and techniques be used in their fights instead of just seeing a Runescape-like hack-and-slash with them just swinging their weapons like hillbillies (no offence). I would also love to see them fight something else besides the same single goblin (hallowed be thy name), by adding more variety of creatures to fight.\n**For those wondering why I keep saying \"hallowed be thy name\" whenever I mention the goblin. It's because I find the goblin to be essentially immortal. It was stabbed in many lethal areas and a multitude of times then somehow it still lives (insert Jackie Chan meme here) so essentially it must be some sort of immortal god where it can brush off all those strikes of death.\n\n3. Story/Characters - The plot of Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash is very slow going with little development. Already 3 episodes in and I still have no idea what it's about besides the rough outline provided by the anime's summary. This overarching storyline of discovering their purpose of who they are and what their purpose is, is constantly overshadowed and left in the corner to rot. Instead of developing the storyline in the episodes, it feels more like a slice of life where we get a small insight into how the characters deal with their situation. The plot has so far remained stagnant with little effort to even try to develop it as evidenced in episode 2, where half the episode was a fight scene against the goblin (hallowed be thy name) and the other half was basically an animation of the characters dawdling around doing nothing while music is played in the background making you feel cheated in your time watching the episode. The only way I can see the plot even attempting to budge is if a huge massive Deux ex Machina just slammed into the series and made such an impact nothing or nobody can ignore it. If the storyline has to continue like this with little development and if they truly need Deux ex Machinas to move along the story this is going to turn out to be a very cheap-shot anime.\nNow onto the characters, while all they do is sit down and talk most of the day, I haven't really been able to build a connection with them because of how little I even know about them. Some of the characters don't even stray past the typical archetypes that typical anime's have which gives me little hope of the characters getting a full thorough development that would make me very happy to see. Yeah sure you can say information has been revealed about them to reveal their general character but beyond that I don't really personally know their characters of them as individuals. I can see in the story that there is a beginning towards developing the characters. But with their lack of memories, you can't truly understand how they act due to their past experiences and how they grew up.\n\n4. Art/Animation - Just like I said in my introduction, amazing and breathtaking! Anymore of my abhorrence towards this anime would make me negatively judge it.\n\nOverall:\nThis anime so far as been a disappointing experience for me as I continue to watch (begrudgingly) in hopes of a new direction the anime is going. I hope the anime becomes better than what I've depicted because I'm just not ready to throw in the towel on this anime after I selected it out of the multitude of others I could've chosen. But as long as I see this anime remain this way this review isn't going to change neither is my opinion. So I tell you, if your interest was piqued by this anime like mine, go ahead by all means go watch it but in my opinion it's going to be a very disappointing ride."}, {"id": 954, "score": 20, "body": "___WARNING: THERE ARE SPOILERS AND SWEARING IN THIS REVIEW.

First flaw is that she isn't even really his wife, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. I hope you enjoy.\n\n__Story: 2__\nHonestly, if you haven't watched this series, I'll summarize it for you. It's a fap fodder show. You watch the characters do basically non-essential stuff before Wakana or some other girl suddenly gets into whatever fap moment the episode shows. I must criticize the Student Council President part, because while yes, she is the Student Council President, THE STUDENT COUNCIL DOES BASICALLY NOTHING. You know the most important thing she did? Made it acceptable for people to hold hands. FANTASTIC LEADERSHIP WAKANA, A FUCKING PLUS. We see a rather shitty \"love triangle\" if you want to call it that, where Misumi also gets into sexual situations, and since she has bigger breasts, she's obviously chasing after the guy and also had more fap worthy moments. I must also say that Izumi is basically the only guy character, which makes it even more possible for the girls to be thirsty for him. Misumi is basically the \"enemy\" of the Student Council, and she has her own little person, and so does Wakana for that matter. You all know that moment where the two little people meet up and they fight for the honor of their \"master\" and it's usually funny? There was only one encounter, and it was just, I lost brain cells from watching it. It was stupid, forced, cliche, and made me want to punch my computer. I might also add that this series is also a comedy (how fitting), so we see all the ways of how Izumi is a \"pervert\", such as Wakana intentionally leaving her panties in the living room so Misumi can see them and then suddenly make Izumi make up a lie that he is a cross-dresser. GRADE A CONTENT GUYS. BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE. Izumi and Misumi end up in a love hotel, and a sex toy suddenly fall into Misumi's private areas and basically going full blast to Izumi's utmost horror. Izumi also later sees Misumi's privates in full later in the series because we've obviously gotta make that peach joke! Also, when I watched the final episode I thought, \"Wait, how is this the last episode? It felt like a regular episode.\" YUP, THEY DIDN'T EVEN GET MARRIED OR HAVE A WEDDING OR ANYTHING. JUST GAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.\n\n__Characters: 3__\nJesus Christ, I want this to end. Our main MC Izumi is basically that guy who works hard, gets his stuff done, etc. He is a rather bland character throughout, except when he's being authoritative, stopping Wakana from doing stupid stuff. Speaking of Wakana, she is like an 8 year old that has boundless amounts of energy. She doesn't even look fit for the job of Student Council President, and is quite naive. She also does whatever sexual act she's supposed to for the episode, like letting Izumi take off her panties in an alleyway because screw decisions, we need fap material! Misumi is a rather voluptuous girl, yet she is pure and dancing in the green hills of Europe, which of course is a stereotype that is quite common in ecchi and hentai. She tries to enforce stupid stuff, like no holding hands, (remember that from earlier?) or showing you're in a relationship with a person. But we saw her privates anyways, who gives a damn! (Christ, I feel like face desking.)  The rest of the characters are basically useless to mention since not even the anime gave a damn about them. And when they did show up they were basically fap fodder, like Misumi's sister straddling Izumi and Wakana's mom falling onto Izumi in a way so Izumi can accidentally lick her privates. (OH JOY) Might I add that Wakana's mother looks like a third grader and sounds like one as well even though she is FORTY(or thirty, I dunno). If you're into that stuff then good for you, but I'll stay away.\n\n__Sound: 7__\nSound was fine, but the characters sounded like those voices you'd regularly hear from a hentai or something like that. Music was fine as well but nothing stood out to me. Opening was pretty meh and cliche.\n\n__Visuals: 7__\nThe visuals were rather normal, nothing that made me go, \"OMFG THAT JUST MADE MY EYEBALLS ORGASM.\" Sometimes the quality was lowered, but I didn't really care all too much. Please note that this is the last good thing about this series you will hear.\n\n__Enjoyment: 1.5__\nThis show is fap fodder as I stated in the beginning. It adds nothing to your life but wasted semen on something you could've felt good that you masturbated to, but NOPE. The ecchi scenes aren't even that great, it's just toned up a bit. The comedy doesn't add much to the show, I never really even laughed at all. The story and characters were absolute shit. I don't recommend watching this series in the slightest, except if you want to see how shit an ecchi series is compared to this. I know there's an OVA, but I didn't watch it as I could've cared less. If they got married and then had sex FUCKING WOOPEE, good for them. This series is the worst anime series I have ever seen. May my eyes not have to suffer through something like this again. Once again, I hope that you enjoyed. If you think this series is actually good, then good for you! You can like whatever you want, and be proud of it. ^O^ Hope you have a wonderful rest of your day!\n\n_DaDerpBear_"}, {"id": 964, "score": 30, "body": "My Imouto: Koakuma na A\u00e2\u0080\u0094roughly, My Sister: Little Devil with an A Cup, but I will affectionately refer to it from here on as simply \"My Imouto\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094is an exceptionally short hentai with some forced writing, but a fairly cute setting and characters.

Not that that's any excuse, just a matter of perspective. As is typically the case, writing takes a backseat to what most people are watching this for, but that said, there's far worse storytelling out there. In fact, there are plenty of non-hentai anime I would count on the list of less realistic writing and less believable characters. Also worth noting, the female lead isn't always as bratty as the synopsis makes her sound, and there's a little bit of crossdressing/roleplaying sprinkled into the story for fans of that genre.\n\n__Art:__ Pretty good. I wasn't blown away, and the animation is pretty cheap/static, but the illustration itself isn't bad, and the characters are both very cute. There are very few relevant characters outside of the main two to judge in terms of art design, but the ones that do make appearances seem to be animated with about as much care as their leading counterparts.\n\n__Sound:__ This series takes the more subdued approach taken by many hentai in boasting a soundtrack composed mainly of soft, pretty piano music. So if 2 Girls 1 Cup didn't destroy that kind of music for you forever, then I guess you're in good shape. Voice acting is average and perfectly passable, and the only really goofy or out-of-place sound effect I can recall is on the title slide.

Also the way she meets the main love interest makes no sense due to me simply asking \"how did they get from bumping into each other to sitting beside each other on the log ride\"? It also shows that she makes the same mistakes with her daughter as her mother did; tying her daughter's childhood to consumerism.\n\nThe amount of plot in this animation would be laughable if it were even tangible, however the animators appear to have not had any sort of plan laid out from the beginning. Also do not bother with this if you expect any semblance of character development; instead it's more of a slideshow of the woman's life where short moments of her life are presented with no context - likely meant to be inferred by the viewer.

At the halfway point I wanted to shut it off, play some XCOM instead because I was really unmoved by it all. It felt slow, it felt like the characters had gotten bland after years away and I was pulling it apart more. The soundtrack was bugging the shit out of me I kept picking out moments were the music would ruin moments and seemed really out of place. I wasn't amazed by the animation either, it's not by any stretch of the imagination bad but it never amazed me and I was just waiting for something to remind me of why I liked Digimon in the first place. Why I watched the show as a kid with eyes glued to the tv in amazement or later as a teen still finding enjoyment in it. I was geared up to really dislike Digimon tri.\nDue to the sheer number of characters I feel like rating all their overall performances would pointless, especially as this movie mostly focuses on Tai and Matt. Starting with them it feels like the writers are trying to make Tai deeper by showing how Tai realises just how real the damage caused by the battles can be but I don't understand most of his actions throughout the movie. Matt's always been an emotional little shit and in this movie it shows however he does come across as the more herioc and proactive of the two. I feel like the writers are stepping on old group with the two meaning that it all feels a bit familiar, and I'm more than happy to bet $5 that in the next movies they're gonna have a punchup. Everyone else is just there for the sake of it and I hope they build on them more later because I feel like they've grown up but that haven't actually grown as characters.\nAs I said I very nearly disliked this movie so obviously it does some things right. Despite some bad comments on animation earlier it does have some nice moments towards the end of the movie and overall the whole thing has a nice colour pallet. The soundtrack is awful but I really liked the opening, I like how it matches the movie and is pretty catchy as well. I felt invested in the characters instantly because of my connection with the series but I feel it adds some things that could add to the series in later movies. Like the introduction of Meiko who feels important to the plot and shows the signs of being an okay character. Despite my rant about Tai and Matt the fight they have in this movie feels more adult (probably because they nearly are adults) and it seems like the two boys are beginning to realise just how far apart they're drifting. I also get the impression they're going to build certain characters and maybe get some of them together but a nerd can only hope.\nI'm not entirely pleased but I'm looking forward to next movie.

It can be hard to move on to a similar piece of entertainment without finding a way to mentally detach from the previous one. Many people would suggest finding something light-hearted or starting something that is easy to digest.  This is how I began watching _Active Raid_, a show that in different circumstances I would consider not finishing.\n\n_Active Raid _is a 12 episode show that follows a police task force named \"Unit 8\". The unit is commonly seen and referred to by various government branches and members as a black sheep group, due to the heavy amount of collateral damage that follows the team's deployment. The unit is filled with oddball individuals that pilot exoskeleton mech suits called \" Will Wear\". The unit has many common character tropes from top to bottom. A rookie looking to make a name for herself (by agreeing to report on the unit to a higher up), two field agents that annoy each other to no end but inwardly respect one another, a well endowed female member who has a strange obsession or fetish( depending on how you interpret it), and the female commander who looks like a teenager.\n\nThese characters, along with the rest of the unit, provide the heart of the show. They use any chance they get to throw a party or go drinking, they consistently become exasperated with the bureaucracy of their job, and help with a wide range of crisis. I can say firmly that my enjoyment comes solely from the characters and the situations they are put into. Whether it's a poker tournament, a cross dressing idol concert or a tribute show to the old mecha fandom of the 70's and 80's._ Active Raid_ is at its best when it allows the unit to work within the realm of the absurd, giving the characters a chance to comment on some of the ridiculous nature of the job.\n\nHowever, the show has many faults against the aforementioned praise. Mainly, that the police angle and villain add nothing of substance to the show. The police officer label that the show focuses on in its opening credits and during action scenes is for flash only. \"Unit 8\" does very little police work, if at all. Episodes 1 to 8 were the exact same format of a show with two halves. First, background of a unit member and then in the second half the unit is dispatched to resolve a conflict in progress because another prefecture or branch is asking for help. Active Raid attempts to have an overarching connection between the crimes from episode to episode, but the characters themselves do not put any of the pieces together until the climatic finale has been pressed upon them. This puts the show in an awkward position of minimizing Unit 8's police work , and using off day scenes to drive the story forward. Ironically, these scenes are far more interesting than any brief desk work that the individual members do. Creating a riff in the viewing experience for the audience, as some may realize (such as myself) that the main draw of the show - a police anime with mechs- is uncreative and dull.\n\nThe villain, Mythos, is incoherently used to make a larger point that rigidness and the protocol of a government may put a country in harm's way. But the show in a clumsy manner, reveals information - along with a motive for Mythos- in the last three episodes of the show. While the shows earlier episodes poked fun at this theme, the lack of weight put toward the topic makes the whole finale taste like cold pizza. Provisional at best, but the audience would have preferred something warmer, something with a bit more depth than a teenage boy (Mythos) creating an online terror organization with other teenage boys(Bird, Dog) just to get revenge.\n\nWhile whole heartedly recommending Active Raid feels cruel, watching it with the caveat that the show does have a serviceable slice of life element to it seems fair. So if you do end up watching this show, go in with low expectations. It's a by the book experience that has decent chemistry between its characters, but falls under its own stupidity once you put some thought into the universe it presents.\n\n__Things of Interest__\n- The [OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTbEWUgs-UY) really grew on me. Especially when they introduced the 2nd half title card animations.\n\n- The homage to Super Sentai using mech suits in the unit was a nice touch.\n\n- The detail put into a software app Liko, and then Benu was also a great gesture. Showing the impact of the show in the ending credits with the two replacing one another was cute.\n\n- The fights scenes were well animated.

Positive because the director of the series Atsuko Ishizuka, did such a great job with _No Game No Life_. Which stood out last year for its art design and color palate. However, _Stride\u00e2\u0080\u0099s_ source material originated from an otome game (romance games targeted at women). This fact had me worried that the show would become a clone of a certain swimming show involving men from a commercial.\n\nThe art and style of this show is on point. The styling of the races and OP are reminiscent of_ Air Gear_ and _Persona_, using different textures to create a vibrant background involving all of the characters that filled the screen. Anticipation for each race is a result of how clean and polished the environment was. Everything from the obstacles, to the design of the large scaled font on the sides of buildings created some wonderful scenes. Making me yearn for more action in each race.\n\nBut that excitement was doused upon by _Strides_ inability to present a race coherently. In early episodes, it was hard to understand the scale of the objects the runners were maneuvering around. Mainly due to the editing and the abundance of tight shots on the runners clearing the objects, the distortion that it created was frustrating. In later episodes this issue is less frequent, but the secondary annoyance is the decision to not provide the audience a layout or map or distance or anything really, to convey basic information about the area where the teams are running. There are quick cuts to a top down map on a screen, but the issue is unresolved because the shot follows the runners instead of pulling out to show them in relation to the map as a whole. The best that Stride can muster is the time difference between each leg of the race as members prepare to relay with their partners, but that information is slightly useless due to the fact that the audience is rarely given overall times or even the average time of each member.\n\nAll of that should make it obvious what the show is concerned with. _Stride _is a show that puts the relationships first and the competition second. There is nothing wrong with that focus in a sports themed show. One of the common tropes in sports anime is the childhood promise to win a big tournament, stating that you compete for your friends and not yourself, and the clash of two rookies who end up working well together. Stride hits all of those beats and more, but the balance of the show feels distorted.\n\n\n\nIt is hard to justify viewing_ Stride_ as sports show about running. While there is a framework for that is in place the  running and training is just a device used to enable the students to participate in various antics, whether the students are modeling for a sponsor or going on a trip to their rivals -Galaxy Standard- training facility and throwing a beach party. Even though_ Stride_ doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to fully embrace its otome game origins, it does not shy away from the potential male/male romantic pairings that are occasionally implied. Making the show awkward at times to sit through.\n\n_Stride_ in general is plagued with an attempt of trying to please a wider audience, but wounded itself in the process. There is the generic sports show about running, along with the romance (or \u00e2\u0080\u009cbromance\u00e2\u0080\u009d) created from the winking subtext of the relationships between members of the team. In simpler terms, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to enjoy the show as a whole if one of these aspects doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t appeal to you. Potentially leaving certain members of the audience disheartened when the show is unable to earnestly present enough of a race, or move away from the dreamlike world of male teenage bonding.\n\nIt is just fine if you enjoyed the show, I know there will be some individuals out there who did. But the if you are considering whether or not to watch  _Stride_ just be ready to come face to face with a lesser version of_ Free!._"}, {"id": 1026, "score": 40, "body": "I had absolutely zero interest in watching Pom Poko. I never intended on watching it, I never intended on caring about it, I honestly didn't think I'd like it, and I had other anime to watch. Plus, an anime entirely about tanuki just didn't appeal to me, and probably never will. I was so sure I would go through my life never watching this movie...unfortunately, I took a class on Japanese supernatural creatures in college, and on the last day of classes, my teacher made us watch this...and my fears were correct: not only was this movie disappointing, but watching it just made me feel drained and uneasy. The only time I was happy was when this movie finally ended or was close to ending. Honestly, I can't stand this movie and I hope to never have to see it ever again.\n\nThe story is about a bunch of tanuki who live their normal lives in peace...until humans come into their forests and knock everything down so they can make houses and a new neighborhood for humans. This makes the tanuki angry, and they try to fight off the humans as much as possible in order to preserve their homes, even going as far as to use their shapeshifting powers. Unfortunately, some of the tanuki have forgotten how to shapeshift and have to learn from the masters in order to do so. Some will stop at nothing to fight off the humans, some even suggest that they kill humans, and others just want to save their homes. Yeah, it's a pretty heavily environmentalist movie.\n\nHonestly, this movie could have been great, and it does have a lot of things people would like: animal characters, great Ghibli animation, a wonderful soundtrack, and an aesop about protecting the environment. Unfortunately, this movie fails so hard in so many ways. For one, the movie barely shows anything. All it does is jump from scene to scene for just about no reason just as people are getting to understand what the heck is going on. It doesn't help that there's an obnoxious narrator who is present throughout THE ENTIRE MOVIE who NEVER shuts up about anything! I think the movie would have benefitted so much had they cut out the narrator! Instead of having that narrator info-dump about the tanuki losing their homes, why not show the tanuki losing their home and their reactions to it! Well, technically, they do, but it's so forced in and heavy handed that the movie gives us no reason to care about the characters or their plight.\n\nSpeaking of the characters, I'm not afraid to say this: the characters in this movie don't feel like actual characters. They feel more like props to force feed the audience the story's message than anything. All of them are extremely one note, bland, one-dimensional, and pretty much never develop throughout the entire movie. One character, Gonta, is especially terrible because all he does is whine about how he doesn't get to kill any humans. Almost all of the characters are incredibly mean spirited, and the ones who aren't don't do anything to make us care about them or like them. The only character I even remotely liked was the one tanuki lady in the red kimono. She was a strict teacher, but had moments where she was hopeful, told jokes, had fun, and genuinely cared about her elders and the students, so she wasn't being a strict teacher for the sake of being strict. But she didn't get enough screen time to make me like her. All of the other characters are just either ciphers or mouthpieces, nothing else.\n\nThe animation is good as usual, and the music is the same, and...honestly, I don't have a problem with tanuki using their testicles in this movie. They're clearly using them for non-sexual purposes, and if they do use them for sexual purposes, its always consensual and never played for fanservice or ecchiness. I know some people would be absolutely horrified by this, but there are worse things out there than mythical cartoon animals using their balls to transform themselves and fight humans. Besides, animals using their sexual organs is common, and it's never portrayed as fanservice-y in any anime I've seen. I DO, however, have a problem with the movie's execution of its morals. It has a very heavy message about how humans hurt the environment with their housing projects and technology, but it's so heavyhanded and forceful that it feels like its force-feeding its message to us rather than letting us interpret it for ourselves. Above all else...the tanukis' struggle is all for naught. We pretty much know that they're not gonna win no matter what, so the question we should be asking is...was it all worth it? What should we even take from this? I honestly don't know, but I do want the two hours I spent watching this back.\n\nWant to know the worst thing? This was penned by Isao Takahata, the man behind Grave of the Fireflies and Tale of Princess Kaguya, among other films. He's usually a lot more restrained than this, so to see one of his works be so ham-handed and cringe-inducing is extremely unlike him. Needless to say, I didn't like this movie. At all. All watching it did was make me feel drained. Now I know what the TVTropes term Darkness-Induced Audience Apathy is, because this movie pretty much exemplifies it.\n\nNot Ghibli's best work. I'd recommend Nausicaa, Kaguya, or When Marnie Was There over this. It's just...not a good movie, and not even good animation and music can save it. It was a massive chore to watch, and a massive waste of time."}, {"id": 1030, "score": 10, "body": "___Note: This review contains spoilers. I've hidden them under the spoiler tags. If you haven't watched the show and hate spoilers, you better be careful reading this.___\n\nHave you ever wondered about an alternate 'what if' route spun to a good story? If it is utilized properly, it could be a good alternative route that could possibly rival the original story. But, if it was handled poorly, it can turn horribly wrong and end up becoming a trainwreck.\n\nUnfortunately, Tokyo Ghoul \u00e2\u0088\u009aA is a show with the situation of the latter.\n\nA continuation to the an adaptation to the manga with the same name, Tokyo Ghoul \u00e2\u0088\u009aA tells an alternative route diverging from the manga, which follows Kaneki's adventure after the event of the Aogiri arc, which has him joining Aogiri to protect his friends.\n\n__Note:__ From here and out, I'm going to review Tokyo Ghoul \u00e2\u0088\u009aA from standalone, not relating or talking about the manga to determine its quality, because the two as a whole are very different things.\n\nWhile the concept of Kaneki joining Aogiri is interesting to say at least, it comes off as horribly executed and came out of nowhere, and feels forced. First off, what for did Kaneki join the group that tortured the living shit out of him? The show did not explain it further and executed it without any thoughts. What's worse is, the subplot was abandoned when ~!he decided to leave the group in Episode 7 which is made more confusing since they did not explain how did he left the group!~, and the plot adds nothing to the main story as a whole.\n\n\u00e2\u0088\u009aA also had a habit of introducing subplots that came out of nowhere, and ends vaguely without adding any meaningful development to the main plot at all. For example, ~!there is an instance about them saving a guy named Shachi from Cochlea. A few episodes later, Shachi disappeared without any explanation at all.!~ Then, ~!the twins also did nothing to the story at all, and like Shachi, they also disappeared after the Cochlea raid!~.\n\nThe ending of the show would be the biggest disappointment of the plot. It just had ~!Kaneki walking through the road with Hide in his lap, then he meets Arima and BOOM. The screen goes black all of a sudden!~. The ending did not solve anything at all, leaving holes open wide for the story.\n\nMost of the time, the characters would compensate for the poor plot. Unfortunately it's not the case for \u00e2\u0088\u009aA, since it handles the characters so poorly. Kaneki, who is the most prominent character in the previous season, is downgraded to a doll with no emotion. He just spends most of his screen time wailing and screaming in agony. His motivations are also vaguely hinted, and they had him joining Aogiri for no apparent reason other than 'protecting his friends' which is of course illogical.\n\nThe other characters are also pushed to the background. Touka becomes completely useless, Tsukiyama has no role other than being a comic relief, and the rest are just there. From the CCG side, the show had a habit of introducing them, and then pushing them to the background and it's hard to connect with the characters when you know almost nothing about them. The only developed characters are probably Ayato, Suzuya, Amon and Hinami.\n\nThe soundtrack is good. Most of the background music are well-handled and fits to the show as a whole, and the ending theme is definitely superb. The main criticism would have to go to the opening, which lyrics are unreasonably very un-catchy. The voice work is average, although I have to admit that Kaneki's screaming can get irritating sometimes.\n\nNow another criticism goes to the animation. Most of the time, the animation was fine, but when it gets poor, it was really bad. Take a look at Shachi and Kaneki's fight in Episode 4, as well as the scene of Irimi jumping at Hachikawa and his squad in Episode 11. You can see that the budget of the show went down when you see the keyboard scene in Episode 6. The art is good, although sometimes it gets QUALITY art, such as Arima's chin being too long and Kaneki being poorly drawn after jumping from Tsukiyama's attack in Episode 10.\n\nOne merit to this show however, is that the fight scenes are still brutally entertaining, and can be a good watch if you're looking for some action.\n\nWith all that said, Tokyo Ghoul \u00e2\u0088\u009aA had little to no redeemable qualities in my opinion. This is a show that I would not recommend to most people, given its convoluted plot, forgettable characters, and average to poor animation.\n\n__SCORING LIST__\nStory: 1/10 (Convoluted and full of plotholes)\nArt and Animation: 5/10 (Fine, but very bad when it gets poor)\nSound: 6/10 (Great BGM/ED, average voice work, opening is poor)\nCharacter: 2/10 (Forgettable, only a few of them are developed)\nEnjoyment: 1/10 (Definitely not)\nOverall: 1/10"}, {"id": 1041, "score": 40, "body": "~~~__A Story With a Kafkaesque Touch__~~~\n~~~\nimg520(http://img03.deviantart.net/31b3/i/2013/003/b/7/kokoro_connect_v2___anime_icon_by_rizmannf-d5qboa3.png)~~~\n\n__Story:__\nKokoro Connect is a story about five high school students who form a club known as the Cultural Research Club. The objective of the club is to publish newsletters, but the five members just often end up doing random things because of the amount of free time they have. It may seem easygoing at first, but then a sudden phenomenon of body-swapping occurs between two of the five members. It doesn't stop there because the same phenomenon then happens to the rest of the members. They then find out that it was caused by a person known as Heartseed. Heartseed's intentions are to see how various phenomena affects the relationships between the five members and he is doing it for entertainment. As the story progresses, the five members slowly start to uncover each other for who they really are. The various phenomena throws the relationships between the five members into a disarray, but it also offers them a chance to help each other and become greater friends.\n\n~~~img320(https://67.media.tumblr.com/8f26a34cb9d262bec4a52d9fddde311e/tumblr_n8isowfAW51s5mgubo1_500.gif)~~~\n\nKokoro Connect is basically an anime that adds a supernatural twist to the school-drama genre. It has many interesting concepts such as dealing with mental disorders and how the value of one's identity fares against human relationships. As the series progresses, we get to see the characters overcome the various problems that happen. We get to see these characters learn to accept each other for who they really are and we also get to see revelations of a lighter note. As a first impression, Kokoro Connect can be perceived as something that is capable of becoming great because of not only the concepts which it deals with but also because of the fact that it can be described as being Kafkaesque.\n\n>\"Characters in a Kafkaesque setting often lack a clear course of action to escape a labyrinthine situation. -A setting that straddles fantasy and reality, and a sense of striving even in the face of bleakness\u00e2\u0080\u0094hopelessly and full of hope.\"\n\nKokoro Connect starts off fast by introducing the first phenomenon and the catalyst behind it. The catalyst or \"Heartseed\" as he is known, instigates these events just for the sake of entertainment. By the end of the show, we are left with no story behind Heartseed. We never find out what he plans to learn or achieve by doing all of this. In short, he is just a massive troll. The characters lack a clear course of action because they never try to dig deep by trying to figure out the reasoning behind all the supernatural happenings. The story fills the characters with hope as they try to go through the various phenomena, but there is always that lingering sense of hopelessness because they know that Heartseed will just keep playing with them. This is what makes Kokoro Connect seem Kafkaesque. The characters are going through a complicated experience where in things are not made clear. They struggle and struggle against the issues, but they can never stand a chance against  the force that is Heartseed. If you don't get it, then you pretty much got the idea of how complicated a Kafkaesque story can be. I'm pretty sure that the creator didn't know what he was doing though because the story does have many flaws. Kokoro Connect did have the potential to be great, but it squandered it and the fact that it was cut to 17 episodes (It was intended to be 24 episodes) contributed to that. The series was too fast, light and forced. Although it is common gimmick, the first phenomenon of body-swapping was good because it let the characters open up to each other. The execution however was so quick that they ended up needing to introduce more phenomena in order to keep things entertaining. These phenomena just ended up turning into mere plot devices. The fast pace sticks around for the entirety of the series because they never go far enough with each phenomenon and they just end so suddenly. They should have just stuck to body-swapping and used creative ways to execute the story. The second problem with Kokoro Connect is its lightness. As I stated earlier, there are revelations of a lighter note which are revealed. Things like confessing to someone that you masturbated to them. There is unnecessary humor that shouldn't have been involved such as the case with erotic jokes and jokes that prevent the series from being taken seriously. If you're going to bring in comedy then don't do it whilst dealing with a serious issue in a series because that's just insulting. The last problem with Kokoro Connect is how forced it is. There are tons of issues that are mostly dealt with through exposition and friendly chats. The ending is also forced because it puts the characters in a nonsensical situation and does not conclude everything.\n\n<hr style=\"height:3px; border:none; color:rgb(60,90,180); background-color:rgb(60,90,180);\">\n\n__Sound and Music:__\nThere is nothing much to say about Kokoro Connect when it comes to sound and music. There wasn't anything bad, but neither was there anything spectacular. There wasn't really anything memorable, but the sound and music did serve their functions well enough to make the scenes seem a tad bit better.\n\n~~~img320(https://67.media.tumblr.com/98ae4261f6a7c001590ab9ab6bf7d015/tumblr_n1drwll4zk1s4cujlo1_500.gif)\n~~~\n<hr style=\"height:3px; border:none; color:rgb(60,90,180); background-color:rgb(60,90,180);\">\n\n__Art and Animation:__\nFor the visuals, Kokoro Connect had some nice cinematography and there were some nice backgrounds that really fit their scenes because of the lighting, but everything else was pretty average. I was actually surprised that this wasn't made by Kyoto Animation because the character designs are very similar to that of K-ON. Kokoro Connect did have some drops in quality when it came to its animation. The backgrounds were spotty and there were also frames that shouldn't have been extended but used in different ways. This anime did get cut to 17 episodes so it's no surprise if they did have problems during production.\n\n~~~img320(https://66.media.tumblr.com/9de39e335329cfac20a339ce58f87e3f/tumblr_nw9r64f1KH1uipy4io2_500.gif)~~~\n\n<hr style=\"height:3px; border:none; color:rgb(60,90,180); background-color:rgb(60,90,180);\">\n\n__Characters:__\nKokoro Connect is a story that is driven by its characters and the interactions that they have with each other. The show starts off with the body-swapping phenomenon. It's a phenomenon that has been the staple of several genres because it is not only used for humor, but also for character development. The overall screen time for the characters is unfairly balanced though. The series feels like a harem that revolves around the main character Taichi even though that is not the type of genre it is. The romantic tensions in the series often center around the female characters and Taichi, leaving the other only male club member (Aoki) to be a useless character. Taichi is meant to be a representation of selflessness, but he comes off as being selfish which is even something that he himself admitted in the series. The strongest characters in the series are definitely the female characters because they each struggle with a form of self-identity. For the most part, the characters were handled well. Apart from the screen time, they should have also given us a backstory of Heartseed. He shouldn't just be there for the sake of exposition because he is a force to be reckoned with.\n\n~~~img320(https://67.media.tumblr.com/c2f6228671564ca7f6b16679e728c78a/tumblr_o89pa9AM9U1rcufwuo1_r1_500.gif)~~~"}, {"id": 1042, "score": 40, "body": "~~~img1180(http://i.imgur.com/mUCOXhx.jpg)~~~\n\n<div align=\"justify\">For a show all about pain, feelings and empathy, _Kiznaiver_ carries surprisingly little emotional baggage. And for a show that entirely rests on creating a relatable, engaging and multifaceted cast, it does a questionable job of that too. But perhaps the most concerning of _Kiznaiver_\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foibles is that, in exploring a relatively simple set of themes that have been explored countless times before, [Studio Trigger](http://anilist.co/studio/803/Trigger) fails to innovate, fails to execute and fails to handle its story with any sense of tact. \n\nIn fact, as far as substance is concerned, _Kiznaiver_ is almost tacky. This is a massive shame. Going into it, I had high hopes for this anime. And as a long-time fan of Trigger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s works it honestly troubles me to say that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m:\n~~~img480(http://i.imgur.com/MK52z8d.jpg)~~~\n\n\n#Seven sophomores walk into a bar\n***\n\nIn an effort to create world peace, a deadpan, kawaii as fuck, blunette high schooler has come up with the bright idea of \u00e2\u0080\u0098bonding\u00e2\u0080\u0099 seven classmates such that their physical and eventually emotional sensations are shared equally among them; to make them \u00e2\u0080\u0098Kiznaivers\u00e2\u0080\u0099. As ethically questionable and as logically dubious this experiment may be, it makes for a unique and alluring premise. \n\nUnfortunately, the end result is not nearly as appealing. \n\nThe root of the problem lies with the cast. Practically every character is introduced as an archetype. The most obvious example is with our seven guinea pigs. To list them off, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got: the blank and apathetic MC, the tsundere childhood friend, the macho broman, the lofty loner, the patronising coolfag, the moe crazy chick and a sadomasochist. \n\n~~~img480(http://i.imgur.com/Tsj7SdD.jpg)~~~\n\nThis really isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t an issue. The point of the experiment is to bond seven totally different characters that otherwise wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t normally associate with one another and build some form of empathetic connection between them.\n\nThe initial direction that the show appeared to be heading towards was that, in spending time together and interacting with one another, each of the cast would open up and transcend their stereotypes, ultimately coming to a better understanding of both themselves and each other. At least, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I was hoping for.\n\nAnd this happens, to an extent. To a very negligible extent. Okay, not really.   \n\nWhat does occur is that a single, private foil to each of the characters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 outward personas is revealed, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it. After these revelations, barring some really minor attitude shifts, they simply continue behaving, speaking and thinking as they did before. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the thing; the characters never really go anywhere. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly develop, nor do we as an audience come to a more holistic understanding of who they are as people. Sure, they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t utterly one-dimensional. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re two-dimensional, which is only marginally better and quite frankly, unsatisfying. \n\n~~~img480(http://i.imgur.com/5LjqrPb.jpg)~~~\n\nTo say, \u00e2\u0080\u009coh, the popular fuckboy has body image issues and the reason he acts the way he does is because he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s insecure\u00e2\u0080\u009d doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make for a complex or nuanced character. Why has he never been able to overcome his insecurities? How will the other Kiznaivers teach him to overcome his insecurities? What can he teach the other Kiznaivers from his experiences? How will the experiment change him, for better or for worse? These are questions that should have been, but never were, properly addressed. Sure, he has a more sympathetic side, but is that really good enough? To make matters worse, this \u00e2\u0080\u0098characterisation\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is typically presented in a very mundane fashion. This lack of depth applies to majority of the cast, irrespective of their centrality in the story. As such, they never truly succeed in transcending their status as archetypes. __To pigeonhole a character with a couple of over-exaggerated, uninspired traits and with only a hazy backstory as explanation makes him/her just that__.\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incredibly difficult to empathise with characters that are so bland and poorly-fleshed out. We just never receive sufficient reasoning as to why we should care about any of them. This is obviously a huge problem for a show that is essentially a character study. Doubly so for when the central theme is empathising with one another. Consequently, character interactions feel shallow and meaningless whilst the feels fest the series clearly aimed to be was never fully actualised.\n\n~~~img480(http://i.imgur.com/xKYPW99.jpg)~~~\n\n#\u00e7\u0097\u009b\u00e3\u0081\u0084, \u00e7\u0097\u009b\u00e3\u0081\u0084\n***\nThere is one exception. A particular character receives a couple of episodes dedicated specifically to her development and it pays dividends. Her backstory is fleshed out in detail, and consequently we are able to fully grasp her motivations, feelings and behaviour. What was even more rewarding was seeing the rest of the Kiznaivers banding together and facilitating her growth and lasting change. These episodes were undoubtedly the best the series had to offer.\n\n~~~img480(http://i.imgur.com/LB82ded.jpg)~~~\n\nThis is perplexing. Trigger obviously knows how to make their characters compelling, so why stop there? Even the primary two are sorely underdeveloped, which led to major complications as far as plot went. \n\nGiven that character motivations were vague at best, what was occurring onscreen oftentimes felt confusing, rushed and inconsequential.\n\nMuch of the confusion stemmed from how convoluted the Kizna project was. Barring how ridiculous, albeit intriguing, the whole idea is to begin with, many of the systems intricacies are never really explained. Similarly, the dialogue can get excessively heavy-handed. This is particularly the case when characters attempt to express their emotions, where the word choice and sentence construction can become frustratingly circular and awkward. I guess the argument could be made that this reflects the difficulty of expressing human emotion, but it was honestly distracting. \n\n~~~img480(http://i.imgur.com/pkuvDrS.jpg)~~~\n\nThe pacing was very rushed towards the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conclusion. As in, things are abruptly dialled to 100. This, coupled with the cast\u00e2\u0080\u0099s general blandness, led to a real sense of disconnect and thus a lack of gravity or feeling of importance. To exacerbate matters, thematic resonance was also lacking. Not only because the messages regarding empathy, compromise and friendship were predictable and unsophisticated, but because they had been tackled far more succinctly, cleanly and effectively in the past. \n\nAn example of when _Kiznaiver_ loses its grip is when a love pentagon (that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right, 5 points to Gryffindor motherfucker) is introduced to stimulate conflict. Not only is this an excessive, cheap and incredibly contrived tactic, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so out of place. Why some characters that had barely interacted with each other were suddenly lusting after one another was beyond me, let alone why we should care. The melodrama was straight from a daytime TV soap opera, and even then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure things get this ridiculous.\n\nAnd that's the problem. __On top of the hyperbolic characterisation, the drama always felt so forced__. In the end, it's ineffective and only further distances the audience. Subtlety is not one of _Kiznaiver_'s strengths. \n\n~~~img480(http://i.imgur.com/0x9amei.jpg)~~~\n\n#Light at the end of the tunnel\n***\nIf there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one saving grace, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s _Kiznaiver_\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aesthetic design. Once again, Trigger manages to capture just the right amount of the surreal and the absurd in their artistic choices. Colours schemes are vibrant and psychedelic, whilst the direction leads to some wonderfully staged scenes. \n\n~~~youtube(9m-RhWDMUwM)~~~\n\nCharacter designs are on fucking point. Combined with stunning wardrobe choices, this was a definite highlight.\n\n~~~img390(http://i.imgur.com/fJnkD3m.jpg) img390(http://i.imgur.com/HzlvK6Q.jpg)~~~\n\nThe voice actors did a great job too, especially given how dodgy the script could get. They alone could often portray more emotion then what was conveyed through the story. Soundtrack was pretty unmemorable, barring some pretty neat stylistic choices with SFX. The OP and ED were outstanding, and worth watching/listening to even if the show itself necessarily isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. \n\n~~~webm(https://my.mixtape.moe/duejvp.webm)~~~\n\nAnother thing _Kiznaiver_ gets right is comedy, both visual and verbal. This has always been one of Trigger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strong suits, and they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let up here.

Let's skip the banana and let's get right into the ananas. In other words, I won't waste our time with detailed complaints, so we will go through the bad shit fast.\n\nCharacters are better of dead. Unlogical and empty. Spotting the main character in the first scene was just as easy as I predicted. Just focus on the most usual and ordinary brunette guy and yay! It's him! There is very few good aspects of the characters. They are not funny and especially not deep, I was not able to relate to them at all. What did I say? Very few? There are NO good aspects. Case closed.\n\nStory doesn't know in which direction it wants to go. From lighthearted slice of life to mystery to horror, back to mystery and then to romance - in any way and even in my highest spirits and unbeatable optimism all I can say that was good were rare exciting events, mostly in the early episodes. Ending did not bring any mindblowing facts and plot twists, not even any backstory is worth mentioning. Nah.\n\nThe music is just like our protagonist - boring and once you've watched the 12th episode, you'll immediately forget everything about it. On top of it all, the animation is nothing to brag about. The monsters are of a laughable quality and the artstyle is rather annoying - but that is just a matter of a taste.\n\nSo, where is that one good thing about this anime? It's the concept. The pure idea, the skeleton of the plot, the base. How people react to reality's brutality, mental disorders and psychological scars, how trauma can take a form and haunt person down. The execution was poor. But the thought? I'd have loved to see this done. Just totally differently.\n\nIn the end, there is not much to be said. Anime as a whole was disappointment. Every attempt to create the right atmosphere despperately failed. Even then I held expectations for shocking reveals in the last episodes which did not come to happen. As plain as it started it ended."}, {"id": 2057, "score": 47, "body": "Paperweight Eye is a manga about a lonely college student named Marie. She makes dolls as a hobby those dolls often somewhat of a re-creation of a memory or feeling of the past or present, or as her latest work, Majenka, which represents, what Marie hopes to be, her future/present self. After one day putting her dolls on a exhibition, they get stolen. Upon getting the news, she rushes to the exhibition where the staff explains, \"it was almost as if they walked out by themselves.\". On her way home from the exhibition she stumbles across the main suspect, Kahrel, who kidnaps her, taking her to his manor where he demands one thing that seems to bring back memories and questions.\n\n~~~img320(http://i.imgur.com/bb7OuDY.png)~~~\n\nThe story falls under topic like psychological and mystery, revolving around a fantasy version of some every day problems and concerns. The story itself can be considered a brilliance by some, but what this manga fails is how is projects it. The ending was unsatisfying, and left a incomplete story behind. It's missing 20 chapters of clarification. Although clarification isn't necessary, as to make the reader theorize at times, there were too many unanswered questions in this manga, questions: some that the manga revolved around.\n\nThe characters, the characters. An unpopular opinion of mine is that, in fact, the characters are the least good thing about the manga. I feel the characters are underdeveloped, hell, I don't think I even caught Marie's last name. Obviously, last names aren't that important, but as an example. I feel the characters have no clear personalities, and seem to be a bit all over the place.\n\nThe art, on a personal level, is gorgeous and has a refreshing feel to it. While it stays true to the \"usual manga look\", it has a slight \"realistic\" feel to it. Which, some might argue, may give it a uncanny valley type of look, which wouldn't be a problem since this manga revolves around the more uncanny side of things.

It's missing a couple of volumes to explain everything it wants to and convey everything it wants to, while at the same time being too long as is, dragging on events and repeating things way more than it should for its own good. It gets old, and it gets old quickly.\n\nThe dialogue following the story is something one can't really judge accurately (if one isn't reading the Japanese original version) since it depends on the translators and their skill. In the version I read, translators did admit they had small problems, mostly with names (kinda understandable, seeing how most of them are Czech and German for God knows what reason). \n\nBut even with that, there are instances where it's clear that the interaction that the dialogue conveys itself is awkward, eg. the instance when cop scoffs off Maria's notion about a \"strange occurance and a weird man that came by the day before\" (A+ job, mr. Cop). The interactions between the main characters are also awkward as hell and pretty monotonous. They are basically characters that act in one way and one way only throughout the story. You have your smug character, your psychotic character, your blank character and all of it just comes down to flat and uninteresting writing.\n\nAnd while the art is somewhat decent enough to cover some minor aspects of the paper butterfly called characterization which was thrown out the window (those eyes are freakishly large, though), it isn't enough of a redeeming quality (especially since the artwork has its low points, and I'm talking Britney Spears 2007 low points).\n\nAll in all, a time waster that will leave you in regret and with sour taste in your mouth. But the time is wasted, and that was the point, right?\n\n**Recommended music to listen to while reading this manga**: Seeing how piano is a recurring theme here, I would suggest some piano pieces by the likes of Chopin, Beethoven or your little cousins that just started playing it, spiced up with drilling, scratching, crashing pots and evil laughs for good measure."}, {"id": 2084, "score": 30, "body": "<div align=\"justify\">Multi-cour anime are interesting. For the cynic, they are attempts to milk as much cash a franchise possibly has to offer. For the fan, they simply mean more anime to enjoy. Perhaps more objectively, they are a way of covering larger amounts of content, with intermissions to allow production teams to revaluate, reassess and improve upon their approach. \n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to think that _Arslan Senki: Fuujin Ranbu_ fits the latter description. And yet, at a mere 8 episodes, I find the sequel of the 25 episode long _Arslan Senki_ to be incredibly underwhelming. I find it so lacking, in fact, that I question its existence and what purpose it served for the franchise as a whole. \n\n~~~img420(http://i.imgur.com/96tKVg2.png)~~~\n\n#Ever get that feeling of d\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00a0 vu?\n***\nThings pick up right where _Fuujin Ranbu_\u00e2\u0080\u0099s predecessor left off. Kind of. If you recall, the first season finished off with Arslan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forces successfully capturing the Keep of Saint Emmanuel and marching towards the Parsian capital. In other words, shit was about to go down. \n\nExcept it never does. The second cour begins with Arslan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s army doubling back to Peshawar to repel yet another foreign invasion. Meanwhile, Silver Mask, Guiscard and Andragoras are all doing their own thing. \n\n~~~img420(http://i.imgur.com/tMnv6fC.png)~~~\n~~~_[My honour!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXNOQ8ej9c)_~~~\n\nThis opening sequence of events is indicative of the cour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest problem: nothing happens. Virtually no progress is made throughout the entire season. \n\nOkay that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little unfair. Things do happen \u00e2\u0080\u0093 pretty important plot developments at that too. Except, all these developments occur outside the scope of Arslan and his party. That is to say, they all concern less important characters. As such, what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re left with is Arslan and co. dawdling around aimlessly while the show tries to move all the pieces around him in preparation for the next, hopefully more climatic phase. \n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s filler.  And it certainly feels like filler.  \n\n#Welcome to Copacabana beach \n***\nArslan and his troupe are the central figures of the story. They certainly have the most screen time too. And yet this season they, quite literally, go on vacation while the rest of the cast plays catch up. They find themselves embroiled in a boring and predictable subplot that adds nothing to the show. Nothing is gained in terms of plot devices to influence their journey in any meaningful way. Nothing new is achieved. To make things worse, we get more of the same drab, flat humour. Hell, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even learn anything new regarding Arslan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true parentage. \n\nNone of the core group is really changed by the experience either. They simply continue to fulfil their same old archetypal roles. Daryun continues to be a raid boss, Narsus continues to be an insurmountable tactical genius, Alfreed continues to be uncomfortably horny for Narsus,  and Farangis continues to be a stoic pair of tits. \n\nThe point is, the season doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t build upon any of the central cast\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character tropes that were established the previous cour. Even Arslan remains the insufferably kind hearted but determined kid he was at the end of last season. Sure, he has a slight shift in attitude during the finale, but this was a long time coming and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly require eight episodes of lounging around to get to. \n\n~~~img420(http://i.imgur.com/tgdCWVL.png)~~~\n~~~_The season in a nutshell_~~~\n\nThe other major players sort of get some development. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really call it development in the case of Guiscard and Andragoras, who simply reaffirm their caricatures as conniving douchebags. There is some long overdue exploration of Silvermask\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past, which reveals a couple of new dimensions to his character. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still overly simplistic and a pain to be around whenever he opens his mouth, but at least it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something. \n\nWhich is sad, given it was the only thing the cour had to offer. Once again, very little that happens is of any consequence and so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really difficult to remain invested in the show.  At least the boredom only lasts eight episodes. And by the season\u00e2\u0080\u0099s end, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re literally back to square one, albeit with a couple additional elements. \n\n~~~img420(http://i.imgur.com/irjCL7z.png)~~~\n\n#If Berserk 2016 and Mekaku City Actors Episode 9 had a lovechild\n***\nSo _Fuujin Ranbu_ doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t improve on the first season as far as narrative goes, mainly because it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have one. But does it improve technically? After all, with only eight episodes, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be more budget allocated to each individual episode. \n\nNope. It suffers from all the technical difficulties that plagued the first cour. In fact, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possibly even worse. \n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the same shit. Masses of identical CGI soldiers, said CGI soldiers clumsily swinging swords at each other, poor quality art, a drab and uninspiring colour palette that even a more tropical setting can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t save, not to mention the absurdly athletic horses. Thankfully we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any horses jumping on war elephants.

I find them unfitting for the setting and tone, and they simply make it harder for me to take the show seriously as a war epic.

What little progress it does make happens to concern only the side cast, leaving the primary characters neglected and twiddling their thumbs. It fails to improve on the first season. It fails to make any serious plot progression, it fails to develop its characters in any meaningful way and it fails to entertain. You can chalk it up to the source material, but ultimately, as its own independent entity, this season fails at mostly everything really. \n\n~~~img420(http://i.imgur.com/ua1npZR.png)~~~\n\n_Fuujin Ranbu_ is filler.

It is one of the best journeys I have ever had in online games and I will never forget it in my life. Have you played in that game yet, you have?  Then I am sure that you will understand me. Blade and Soul is the game, where I read every single dialogue, every single quest, I know everything about that game. (Almost). And when I found out that one of my most favorite games ever had an anime adaptation, I could not even think about anything else; the only thought in my head was to watch it and to do it as soon as possible. However, my bliss was destroyed after two episodes of this wonderful anime called Blade and Soul. So, let us discuss the storyline. \n\nBlade and Soul (\u00eb\u00b8\u0094\u00eb\u00a0\u0088\u00ec\u009d\u00b4\u00eb\u0093\u009c \u00ec\u0095\u00a4 \u00ec\u0086\u008c\u00ec\u009a\u00b8) is an anime adaptation of the game with the same name that began airing in April 2014. Hiroshi Hamasaki and Hiroshi Takeuchi directed the anime at studio Gonzo from scripts written by Atsuhiro Tomioka. The anime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s storyline revolves around a female swordsman named Alka, who travels to find Jin Valel, a demon-like woman, who has the power to kill any living being, who also killed Alka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s master Hon. Alka heads on a journey to become stronger and to take her revenge. Will she be able to find and kill Jin Valel, or, perhaps, the woman she wants to kill is too strong even for her? Find out the answer now!\n\nWhile the storyline sounds average, it still has too many flaws to be even average: it is bad, it is so bad that you should never watch it, if you are a fan of the game. The main problem with it is that it has too many plot holes: so many things are not explained, so many questions are left unanswered, and the most important thing is that it is unfinished. I understand well that the anime is suffering because it cannot reveal anything about the game. (There is a chance that some people will not play in Blade and Soul, if they find all answers to their questions in that anime). I understand that the budget of this anime created some limitations for this anime, I understand it. But I do not understand only one thing, why would someone spend their money on something that is that bad?  Why not make the creators of the game promote Blade and Soul and make a very good anime adaptation? They might not want to do that? Then, what is the purpose of creating this adaptation? I do not understand it. \n\nThe animation and the music are the only two decent things about that anime. The animation is fine: character designs are okay and the anime has a nice range of colors, too. The anime sometimes uses CGI effects, which will make your eyes bleed. All in all, the animation is not great, but it is watchable, at least. The sound is also average. The whole soundtrack, as well as the voice acting, are dull and unremarkable. Nothing to comment on, to be honest; it is bad. \n\nThe characters are bad too. The villains are your overpowered guys that wear some weird stuff, but it is not the main thing. The problem here is that they do not make sense. What I mean is that in the game the trio of villains did make sense, here; however, they are the dullest villains I have ever seen in my life: Ga Gante is even unable to speak. But it is not the worst part about that anime, the worst part about it is the main protagonist of this series, Alka. I would compare her personality with a bacterium, but I guess that even a bacterium is smarter than Alka. Do not get me wrong, she does receive development in this anime and she will evolve into \u00e2\u0080\u009cslightly better than average character.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Not only Alka, but also her friends and other characters are just dull and do not make sense at all. A good example for this will be the fact that there are people that want to kill her, but they do not understand whether they want to do it, or not. All in all, the characters are another flaw of this anime, which make it that bad. \n\nAll in all, if you have never played in the game, I still do not want to recommend you this show. I cannot name you even one good thing about this show, because even the animation is sometimes bad, no, it is very bad. If you have an enemy; however, and if you hate that person, you can recommend them this anime. It will work, I promise you! Think twice before watching Blade and Soul!

This can often lead to two different outcomes, depending on how little capacity the individual has to stop giving a shit about public opinion: in one, the person evaluating the specific work can end up taking an extreme position, considering it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a naturally divisive work, in order to fit into the group that shares that position. The other outcome, however, is something that I find even more worrying: it can create around certain works the status of \u00e2\u0080\u009cuntouchable\u00e2\u0080\u009d. In these instances, the work is so wildly agreed as being a masterpiece that disagreeing with the consensus is nothing short of heresy.\n\nSo, I think this little diatribe can give a good idea of how I felt going into Watashitachi no Shiawase na Jikan (stupid long-ass names! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll call this one Happy Time for the sake of convenience) and suddenly finding it not as good as I was expecting. In fact, not finding it good in general!\n\nStory and Characters\n\nSometime ago I was discussing with a friend about a certain series we both had problems with and he mentioned that from his point of view it seemed that the characters in that series were not really representations of humans, but personifications of problems. When I began reading Happy Time, I suddenly recalled that specific statement.\n\nBut what necessarily would mean a character being just a personification of a problem? Well, the issue in this case is that, before we have any idea of how the characters can be generally perceived as human beings, the source of characterization is simply the problems that define their struggle. Being Happy Time a drama, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s understandable that the personal issues and traumas faced by the characters would be the focus of the story, but even for a drama, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to first of all, establish what traits the characters have outside of those issues. The problem with letting their traumas and struggle define them is that if they are supposed to be relatable or likeable figures, the audience is left with little ground to identify or attach to them, and if they are not supposed to be likeable or relatable, the lack of defining traits leaves them without solid foundation for their development.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to make a parallel to better explain my points, but before that let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s get to know the unfortunates that compose the story of Happy Time.\n\nMutou Juri is a former pianist that has already tried suicide 3 times and holds a deep grudge against her uncaring mother. She begins visiting prisoners sentenced to death by influence of her aunt Monica, as a way of driving herself away from her depression.\n\nYuu is the prisoner on death row that is visited by Juri and with whom she begins to develop a bond, based on the understanding that both have deep grudges against the situations they were raised in.\n\nMonica is Juri\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aunt and a nun who took the habit (no pun intended) of visiting the prisoners who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have anyone looking after them. In the past, she lost her son in an accident, but couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bear the grudge after the killer committed suicide in prison.\n\nHappy Time\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story already begins at what can be perceived as a conflict, with the main character, Juri, meeting her mother, who is visiting her in the hospital after her third suicide attempt and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear in this scene that their relationship has not been the best for a long time. From then on, the plot dives into its main driving point, the relationship between Juri and Yuu, which follows the tried-and-true development: they first don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see eye-to-eye, but due to the necessity of meeting each other end up finding similarities that lead them to bond and improve each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mindset and way of looking into life. Now, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll not simply disregard how the story develops and the changes they operate into one another, my point here is that, with such weak characterization on both parts, the foundation in which that developments stands on is flimsy and ultimately creates a disconnect between what the characters were and what they become.\n\nThe parallel I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to make here is with another manga, Bitter Virgin. Yeah, I know, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my favorite, call me guilty on that, but the parallel is still valid! Point being: in the first chapter of Bitter Virgin, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a superficial but effective work in giving up the basics about the main characters; Aizawa, the main girl, is generally shy and seems uncomfortable in interacting with men and Daisuke, the main boy, gives on the slight vibe of being a womanizer, while still being a well-centered teenager. When the bomb-shell about the main girl is revealed, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear understanding of how that might have shaped her current persona and subsequently how that affects Daisuke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perception of her. From then on, the manga goes on top explore her backstory, how she transitioned from her old-self to the individual she is during the main events of the narrative and how her experiences affect the people around her.\n\nI like to always keep characters under a microscope, exactly because I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like to carelessly throw around words like \u00e2\u0080\u009cbland\u00e2\u0080\u009d, but that in reality is what the main characters of Happy Time are, bland, their characterization is restricted to the bare minimum to make them realistic, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no three-dimensional figure around that. They act very according to their respective traumas, but what kind of people they were before such traumas shaped them, how their change was perceived by others, or even how others react to the kind of people they are currently is not show to the reader. Most of this problem comes from a fundamental issue on how their backstory and characterization is handled, in that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in blatant disagreement with the rule of Show, Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Tell. What kind of people they were in the past is not shown to the audience, but simply spelled out, how they change as characters is not an easily observable change progressively displayed throughout the story, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s simply stated by other characters. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a principal that boils down to Robot Devil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just have your characters announce how they feel, that makes me feel angry!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThat is not exclusive to how characters feel, how they act, how they interact with others, how they change has to be observable by the audience, otherwise it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all restricted to Inferred Attributes. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m willing to recognize that these issues are a result of the manga\u00e2\u0080\u0099s short length, being it just 8 chapters long. However, understanding how these problems came to be does not make them forgivable, if anything it just highlights poor planning on the writer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s end. More time should be given to fleshing out the characters and reshaping the writing in a manner that could allow the audience to read into the narrative themselves, not be force-fed the development.\n\nIn general, these issues would only be enough for me to classify a work as mediocre, but not straight up bad. The first point where Happy Time gets the rating of \u00e2\u0080\u009cBAD\u00e2\u0080\u009d is when it decides to pull of the Rape Card. For the sake of clarity, pulling the rape card is when a work attempts to sell itself as mature and serious by utilizing rape as a plot point, either in backstory or in the current events of the story. The problem is that you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t simply pull off a rape card, you have to earn it, and again, that is something that Bitter Virgin managed to pull off with much more efficiency. In that manga, the event in question is displayed tastefully but with no sugar-coating, giving full context of how it affected the characters at the time and how it ties in to the current state of things. With no understanding of what kind of person the character was prior to the event and no context of how it happened though, as it happens in Happy Time, it loses its connection with the current events in the story and ultimately becomes a superfluous plot-point, and you simply can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have rape in your story just for the sake of having it.\n\nBeyond that, Happy Time is also a story that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the guts to work its characters darker moments to the full extent, something observable on the revelation of Yuu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s backstory. Besides being almost completely exposited in the very dry and audience-unfriendly fashion like I explained before, Yuu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past and crime are the textbook definition of a generic Woobie-backstory: it does everything possible to exempt the character from any guilty while still pulling the most clich\u00c3\u00a9d but poorly developed sympathy-inducing elements, from growing on an orphanage to dead brother and, worst of all, dead cat. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not arguing that actually giving the character full guilt would be enough to save the story, but would be one point where the characterization in Happy Time could have been truly commendable, it would actually lead the audience to understand the extent of how much he had buried himself before coming back to his senses, making his current state much more fitting and the development he receives more meaningful.\n\nPresentation\n\nThis will be considerably shorter in comparison to my previous reviews, as a manga features fewer elements up for judgment in its presentation than an anime.\n\nHappy Time\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visuals are generally fairly average. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing particularly disagreeable on how the figures are built and, if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m actually free to cut the manga some slack, it manages to present a few design choices that have relevant symbolic meaning within the story: Juri leaves her fancy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cstay away from me\u00e2\u0080\u009d hairdo, adopts a subdued dressing style and ties her hair tighter giving the idea she has become less hostile to interaction, while Yuu accepts cutting the long hair that hid his face and symbolically manifested his unwillingness to get close to others. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also solid pacing in between frames, so there are no instances where how the action went from one image to another looks disjointed or unfocused. The one point the manga could use improvement is on the variation between shades, which would help bring more detail to the expressions.\n\nGods, I sound like a boring twat now!\n\nPersonal Ramblings\n\nHappy Time is currently the 10th highest rated manga on My Anime List, which is sufficient to give it untouchable status to some extent. The danger of a show or manga achieving that kind of status is that it makes general consensus unfriendly to criticism of any type, especially if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s harsh criticism like what I proposed to do here. Deviation from the common opinion is disregarded often as \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou simply watched/read it wrong\u00e2\u0080\u009d, which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m willing to admit might happen but either way is not a worthwhile form of counter-argument. I for once believe that every work should face scrutiny to some extent, even if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something regarded as \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Greatest of All Time\u00e2\u0080\u009d, like Fullmetal Alchemist, Berserk or Legend of the Galactic Heroes. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s by exposing or discussing a show or manga\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shortcomings that we can get to an understanding of what truly makes a Greatest of All Time.\n\nAs you might have guessed, the question that I would like to ask now is: How did Happy Time become so acclaimed? In art, and especially in fiction, objectively defining the quality of a work is near impossible (unless we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about Metroid: Other M, whose story objectively sucks!), but I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible to have a good understanding of the general quality of a work by looking at its audience. Now, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll not pretend I have a deep understanding of the audience of a manga I just read, I can only theorize. Considering that the most popular manga on MAL tend to be shounen, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible to pull out of my ass the idea that this title, having achieved some initial praise, might have been a gateway into drama-centered manga for many readers, who were likely tired of shounen or drifting into other genres and ended up finding an appeal on its quirks. But this is all conjecture.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll not lie, I find disheartening that a title like this is so acclaimed, in front of works far more nuanced and respectful to the audience, like Vinland Saga or Parasyte (or even some shounen!). I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t maintain hopes that this review will somehow \u00e2\u0080\u009cenlighten the masses\u00e2\u0080\u009d, but I hope to throw some perspective into the discussion and challenge some notions about what qualifies a good drama.

It was pretty good. It isn't as good as some people say, the 7 years effort truly shows but it isn't the second coming. The soundtrack was also quite good. The characters weren't anything special. Anyway, to get to the point, what I think made it so bad, was the story. I imagine many would say that it isn't about the plot, it's about crazy explosive fun. But, the plot enables the crazy explosive fun, and in this case, stands against it. Up until the last race, the Redline race, the film was just fine. It started going downhill with the _space nazis_.\n\n__Why I hate Redline__\nThe space nazi's goal is to stop the race. Firstly, it's insanely stupid it is that these space nazis use *all* of their army to stop a race that is doing nothing. The space nazis don't gain anything, the race isn't doing anything bad, they have no motive. There is no logical reason for it.  In the end, what them interfering with the race does is makes the actual redline race 4/5ths space nazis attempting to kill the racers and ~!awakening biochemical weapons!~. The other 1/5ths is them actually having a proper race. 1/5 may be exaggerating in the race's favor as the only time I can actually remember them purely racing is ~!between only two racers!~ for a short time of the 40-minute race at the end. Due to the interference these space nazis caused, rather than the Redline race being a proper race utilizing the enjoyable character's skills and different cars, it becomes a total mess. The attack is boring and uninteresting in every way possible, especially since it's actively destroying the build-up to this race that the rest of the movie has been doing. Note, the build to this _race_, not to this space nazi attack. \n\n__Conclusion__\nBecause of the atrocious final \"race\" this deserves no more than a 2/10. The visuals cannot make up for the atrocious plot and the joke of a race the Redline race was. Just imagine the yellow line race at the star, x4 the time, and with the best racers. That is the wasted potential of the Redline race. At least sonoshee was hot."}, {"id": 2132, "score": 40, "body": "Mixture of cheap action, shallow attempt on creating emotional scenes, reasonless behaviour, holey logic, cheesiness and signs of homosexuality implying we are not only about to see the bad guys proceed in their no-sense-making plans, but even some fun between the protagonist and his harem - that is how I would shortly and precisely describe anime 07 -GHOST. Truth be told, review consisting of these few sentences would most likely create a misunderstanding, which is not my intent. Thus, I shall continue, so worry not, my dear fans of anime we're currently dicussing - I am going to give valid arguments as for why I used such non flattering description and maybe you will even agree with me.\n\n##Cheap action\nUnfortunately, 07-GHOST is classified as fantasy action. The year 2009 sure can be considered as the ancient times of thick lips, bright white backgrounds, pinkey leaves falling all over the screen, but that is not an excuse for the humilitating lack of action, proper battles and epicness. \n\nThe first half of anime brings only a little excitement. The protagonist encounters small flies, enemies unworthy of more than 7 minutes of screentime, one or two hits required to defeat these foes. As the second half of anime draws near, we might expect something more spicey. But that shall remain our modest hope. Even when the main force attacks head on the knights of darkness, all we are allowed to see is a blast. Satisfied? No. Are we getting something more then? Definitely no.\n\nAnimation itself is actually a pretty sight, colourful, with a high percentage of cheesy shots. Character diversity in terms of image is laughable. When animators think you have already forgotten about that cool dude from the beginning, they are going to shamelessly use his looks again, with only a little difference, leaving you confused and pissed. On the other hand, we're getting some sexy angles and Frau's manly chest, so points for that.\n\n##Shallow attempt on creating emotional scenes\nWhat truly is worse than action anime without real action is trying to look deep and psychological without any depth and actually relatable psychological themes. As the main character struggles with his inner conflicts, which is the topic of the first twelve episodes, the watcher cannot relate. \n\nQuestions of guilt and atonement for the death of your dear one could actually ring a bell for some of us, but maybe not if the story takes place in fantasy world where one fights using magical words, is raised as a killer by the army which is, absolutely shocking, actually evil and person makes friends with oath to die with them in the matter of days. I just don't know the feeling. If you do, I take my words back.\n\n##Reasonless behaviour, holey logic\nIf you watch 07-GHOST with your brain turned on, you might start to question its logic. Why did they do that? Why didnt they do _that_? What is the point of this? But just you wait a few episodes, the anime will definitely explain absolutely nothing and if it does, it's going to make even less sense than before. Strategic plans that lead nowhere, anticipated plot twists with zero logic and yet they all manage to look so damn smart it makes you doubt yourself. But don't. That anime really is stupid.\n\n##Signs of homosexuality\nThe one element that could have saved the whole thing. If only had they made it into yaoi. Then all of above could have been less dramatic. But, as you might already know, protagonist and his harem got nothing more than few blushy scenes. Which buries anime another meter underground. \n\nThe problem here is, you do not expect it. People come for action (lol) and fantasy, not guys being all lovey dovey with each other. That is just going to scare off those watchers, who are no fans of yaoi and shounen ai. They just didn't sign up for this.  I, personally, think the gay scenes were at least three times better than the non gay ones. Matter of opinion.\n\n##Overall experience\nWe start off with fresh characters with a lot of potential that goes to waste, at least most of the time,   and never reach anything. The anime is just a promo for manga, which is fine as long as the anime is able to stand on its own. And it is not. We really don't see what these 25 conclude in. I do acknowledge the character development of the protagonist, but that's just not enough. There is just no actual plot, only minor conflicts that follow each other throughout the whole anime.\n\nTo give anime the credit it deserves, music was great. It suited the atmosphere, opening and ending are on my playlist and there is a small amount of humour, which is simple but suffices and the later half of the anime was not boring.\n\nI don't think I  would recommend 07-GHOST to anyone, maybe for the slight shounen ai vibes, but that would be all. I have yet to read the manga, but I hope it does a better job than the anime did."}, {"id": 2134, "score": 25, "body": "_~~~\"This world we live in is a dream.

The anime itself is loosely based on Edogawa's stories. Loosely. I've never read any of his works so I have no way of confirming or denying if this was a faithful representation of them. But given how absolutely absurd everything in this show is... I'm just going to give him the benefit of the doubt and assume his stories are better than this. But who knows? Maybe he DID have a minor morgue side character whose segments are completely insane and hilarious that they don't even feel like a part of this show. Maybe he DID have an imprisoned sadist/masochist master thief character. Maybe he DID have a character who wears a paper bag over his head and can magically disguise himself as anyone. I'd be interested in finding out, actually.\n\n~~~img440(http://66.media.tumblr.com/855e0595f5d15ed3f872df723eaa7bde/tumblr_nrc16nePC31u6zbi9o2_400.gif)~~~\n\n_Okay, hands down, the morgue character/medical assistant is genuinely the best part of the show. It's not like she commonly actually interacts with or are shown with the main characters though, so it feels like her sequences are pulled straight from a completely different show._\n \n___\n\n#Characters#\n\n___\"How are you capable of smiling in this situation you woke up in front of a gory corpse which they think you are responsible for aren't you just a goddamned high school student or something?\"___ ~Thoughts from episode 1.\n\nimg220(http://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire4/30771859d900bf3bad59d0b6cebced171431018151_large.jpg)\n\nThis is our protagonist, Yoshio Kobayashi. He's a middle schooler who one day wakes up in his classroom in front of his brutally murdered teacher. Basically, his whole thing is that he's a sociopath. His whole role in the show is to say \"Fun!\" and smile. All we really know about Kobayashi is that prior to the start of the show, he's been finding life boring. We need a little bit more than that to be able to understand why a middle schooler would still be smiling when he's believed to have brutally murdered his home room teacher. He just happily agrees to dress up as a girl to be kidnapped by this serial killer who kidnaps little girls and then crushes up the ones who doesn't want to be a part of his \"family\" and then turns them into ___cement walls___. Eventually, there's a point in the show where he leaps off of a building to commit suicide because somebody just tells him to. Could argue he was being forced to do this, but he didn't look or sound unhappy about probably jumping to his certain death.\n\nimg220(https://farm1.static.flickr.com/256/18620434332_cba72bfa3d.jpg)\n\nOur _real_ protagonist is this fellow, Kogorou Akechi. He's the actual detective character and unfortunately ends up with the strange Koayashi as his \"assistant\". He's so good at being a detective that he doesn't have to go to school anymore, but by like episode three, he's been shown doing nothing but crushing up pills, taking those pills, and drinking coffee. He's the sort of character who will put on a record of some really melancholic sounding music and then throw a line like this at you: _\"No matter how much medicine I take, the pain doesn't go away...\"._ But then in episode three I guess they realized that they couldn't just have Kobayashi and his friend carry the show, so Akechi is the one who confronts the \"cement wall murderer\". By confronts, I mean he outright starts to fight this tall fat man who abducts and murders little girls. He later has a cast on because he apparently hurt himself punching and kicking the man's fat (???).\n\nHe takes pills, drinks coffee, is a genius, and can fight. He's a detective!\n\nimg220(http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/rampo-kitan/images/6/69/Hashibaprofile.png/revision/latest?cb=20160311215044)\n\nThere's also Souji Hashiba, Kobayashi's friend. His purpose in the show is to follow Kobayashi around wherever he goes basically saying what we're all thinking. \"This is dangerous, not fun, why are you smiling? Getting abducted is a bad thing, and you probably shouldn't almost commit suicide because someone told you so.\" His whole character is \"the voice of reason\" to the extent that almost everything he says is annoying/groan worthy. Like yeah of course middle schoolers shouldn't go around trying to solve murders, we don't need an entire character dedicated to showing how messed up Kobayashi is.

Like if someone had told me that all of these things happened in this anime while having this overall main plot that they wanted people to take seriously (?), I wouldn't have believed them. If we had stuck with the chair or the cement wall murderers, I could have maybe seen a possible \"for the laughs\" argument that could be made.\n\nGoing over absolutely all of in excruciating detail would take hours, feel like easy pickings, and would probably the one reason I would maybe recommend giving this a watch (if you have absolutely nothing else better to do).\n\nChairs are easy targets, let's move on.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/5gcfjof.png)\n\n___\n\n#The Main Plot...

There's this fellow who wears a skull mask calling himself Twenty Faces. He's essentially a vigilante who announces his crimes via the internet beforehand and then murders murderers who are let out early or beat the system. But as it turns out, the original Twenty Faces died (via spontaneous combustion, no less), and this is just essentially the next of many in a line of copycats. Or so, that's what they thought.\n\nIn reality, this vigilante/murderer of other murderers has a pretty strong following and this only increases further as the show progresses. Akechi (the detective) and co. begin to try and stop the spread of Twenty Faces. Because you know, murdering a murderer is still... murder? Perhaps it's my overwhelming belief in humanity, but I don't think the response that would come from the majority of people is _\"okay let's go out there and murder the bad guys!\"_.\n\nGoing any further is spoiler territory, but there are several flaws/problems I still wish to address.

From the characters to the broken humor: everything in this anime feels wrong and wasted, but let me explain it by going through it.\n\nAs the main character you have mayuko, a hard working independent young women, who goes to cram school while working two jobs to support her living. \nThe other main character is niea, a freeloading alien living in mayukos closet. \nBut even if this sounds like a fun idea with lots of potential for the characters to play off each other, in this case it is completely wasted. \nEvery serious or dramatic moment is interrupted by niea, every time someone is doing something interesting niea comes over and brakes the flow with a stupid comment or joke. \nIn the very next sentence the anime shifts back into the usual disturbed mood of drama and the characters behave like niea didn't do anything, sometimes they completely ignore what is going on.\n\nTo me this feels like someone didn't know how to use jokes,it is like they had a joke quota to reach for every episode, so they randomly inserted them in after the episode was done to get the joke ratio they aimed for.\n\nAs for the setting itself and the atmosphere there are many unexplained things in this show for example: how did the aliens come to earth, how was the first contact, what is with the alien class system and the hate towards  aliens without antenna, why is mayuko supporting herself. Nothing is explained even the racism part against niea as an alien without a antenna or a  \u00e2\u0080\u009cunder 7\u00e2\u0080\u009d as they are called. They use this fact in the anime as a joke, niea gets insulted by other aliens and how does she react? Well, she calls them names and sticks out her tongue. That is how mature this show is. The entire show is about them living together in poverty with bad jokes poorly writing characters and no substance what so ever.\n\nThe art itself is OK, but there are times where it looks like a elementary student made the animation. It is worse than your average bad animation it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on the same level as kill la kill and this does not help in any way. On top of that these drops in animation quality happen every time they make a joke/slapstick scene. But otherwise it follows the same lain/renmei style of characters and art, so this will annoy you even more if you are a fan of the visuals of serial experiments lain and heibane renmei. \n\nI would not recommend this anime, go watch another anime made by yoshitoshi abe because this is his weakest work so far.\n\nAlso there is a creepy Indian man explaining stuff in the end of every episode"}, {"id": 2146, "score": 30, "body": "~~~img500(http://i.imgur.com/lQO8KMk.png)~~~\n\n~~~_\"This movie was pretty alright.

It wasn't amazing or anything, but it was enjoyable enough. It was apparently received well enough for someone to actually want to make a continuation of it, ten years later. Ninja Scroll, the thirteen episode long TV series made in 2003, was meant to show the original movie's protagonist's journies fourteen years following the events of the original movie. However, none of the events of the original movie are ever referenced or brought up, so you can easily see it as it being its own entity separate from the original movie about the same swordsman character.\n\nWhich is convenient, because the TV series was... disappointing to say the least. The movie's plot wasn't anything special, but it seemed like they actually tried. With this... there's a weird stone called the Dragon Stone everyone's trying to get as well as this \"Light Maiden\" of legend, and all that really boils down to is a battle with a different (sometimes multiple ninjas) each episode. Then they finally make it to the place they have to go to, a bunch of stuff happens, and the series just sort of ends.\n\nIt'd be a fine action show if... the action was as good as the movie's, if the characters were actually even slightly interesting, and if the ninjas they battle every episode weren't... well...\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/6a2AFLW.png)~~~\n\n...this. You can't throw this at a person in the very first episode (she also spawns swarms of gigantic flesh eating worms from her skin and sends them after her enemies which is but not the weirdest that this show has). Are these ninjas? They don't look like ninjas. As a matter of fact, they very much seem like horrific monsters and/or mutants of some sort.\n\n_Also, there's never an actual \"ninja scroll\" of any sort. That's a petty gripe I know, but still._ \n_______\n\n#Characters...?#\nLet's have a quick run through of the main characters. Comparisons to the movie will be made in the case of the protagonist and one other character, because it's somewhat surprising that both characters actually had somewhat of a personality, motivation, backstory and etc in the movie, and all those are either slimmed down or outright absent in the TV series... making me think this is more of a spin-off rather than an actual continuation/sequel...\n\n~~...which is good because I liked the movie.~~\n\nimg250(http://i.imgur.com/JcRzDPY.png) img270(http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/ninjascroll/images/8/8a/Jubei_Kibagami.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130517103412)\n_Left: TV Series, Right: Movie._\n\nThis is our protagonist, the wandering swordsman, Jubei Kibagami. In the movie, Jubei actually had a past and actually had motivation in cutting through the crazy ninjas so he can stop their leader whom he once killed (or so he had believed). But before he was aware of his connection to these ninjas' leader, he was actually downright abrasive and unwilling to stick his neck out for anyone, and was wholly unwilling to be involved with this trouble until an annoying old man literally injected him with a poison and would not reveal to him the antidote until Jubei helped the old man finish his objective.\n\nWell, that's great. But what about Jubei, TV edition? He similarly doesn't want to become wrapped up in the conflict between these two equally weird ninja groups, but mostly just because he'd rather lie around and sleep. He could have simply tossed the Dragon Stone after it being entrusted to him by its previous dying owner, but he chooses not to because of a change of heart, I guess.\n\n~!To be fair, he only changed his mind when the person requesting of him to do this asked him again as he laid dying. Still though, in the movie, he repeatedly refused to help try and prevent a group from basically overthrowing the government and causing anarchy. In the TV series, he was asked to deliver a weird stone to some girl.!~\n\nAlso, movie Jubei had no special abilities of any sort. He survived all his fights only via his swordsmanship and willpower/determination. TV Jubei on the other hand, has this generic wind slash attack from episode 1 and it basically kills almost every ninja it successfully lands on. Even following them witnessing and becoming aware of this attack that almost instantaneously cuts every ninja in half, they never develop a counter towards it or actually try to avoid it...\n\nIt really doesn't make the action that fun or thrilling to watch at all because even in the few fights where he doesn't use it, I just kept thinking _I wonder when he's going to use the thing_. \n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/W8o86Oc.jpg)\n\nShe's the female lead of Ninja Scroll TV, Shigure. Believed to be the Light Maiden, her home village is soon wiped out by a goliath sized ninja who believes _he is a car_, and begins to occasionally travel with Jubei and co except for whenever the plot decides for them to be split up for a while. Her personality is... there's really not much to say. The first episode, she's all \"I want to explore the outside\" and \"I'm such a skilled warrior that everyone here loses to me in practice fights.\" But then it turns out the outside world is awful, filled with horrible monstrosities of beings, and it turns out she's not at all a master fighter. After that it's mostly just... \"we have to protect her, she's the Light Maiden.\" Eh.  She's no Kagero (female lead of the movie), that's for sure. Literally being 100% poison I guess automatically beats Shigure's _nothing_.\n\nimg260(https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hfSI30jkClI/hqdefault.jpg) img250(http://p2.i.ntere.st/9200dba493b608ac455f3bf78cf6302a_480.jpg) \n_Left: TV Series, Right: Movie._\n\nDakuan, this weird old man shows up and bothers Jubei in both iterations of Ninja Scroll in one way or another. In the movie, he's an agent of the Tokugawa clan and basically sees Jubei as a potentially handy tool in thwarting those wishing to disrupt the rule of the Tokugawas. Manipulative and not unwilling to do some morally questionable actions to bring about the result he's aiming for, he poisons Jubei once Dakuan realizes Jubei is wholly unwilling to help him out of the goodness of his heart. In the movie, he's an actually serious character.\n\nIn the TV series, he's just the old man in Jubei's group. He may or may not still be a spy but I don't think they really ever mention that. Or perhaps it's just a really similar looking old man...  \n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/G27l7js.jpg)\n\nFinally, we're at Tsubute. A thief character Shigure encounters and then becomes a part of Jubei's group because literally why not. They needed another character, I guess. He literally contributes absolutely nothing at all, even moreso than Shigure and Dakuan (he can at least sort of defend himself and the other two a little). Apart from dialogue because of course we need dialogue, Tsubute's biggest contribution to the show other than be annoying is trying to steal the Dragon Stone from Jubei/Shigure on multiple occasions despite not even knowing if he could actually sell it for anything. Why continue to let the obvious and clearly unrepentant thief continue to travel with you even though he keeps trying to steal from you and contributes NOTHING????\n\nThat covers the main characters. What about their enemies, if this show's plot is really little more than \"they proceed to  travel and then are attacked/ambushed by ninjas\"? \n\n_________\n\n#The \"Ninjas\"#\n_\"Bat ninja? His power is bats! HOW ORIGINAL.\"_\n\nI recall thinking when I was watching the first episode, \"Well, okay, I don't see this getting any weirder, if this is what the start is like.\"\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/kZxB4zb.png)\n\nBut then, of course, there's the ninja who is literally just an eyeball that flies down people's throats to possess them. Thus, Jubei is straight up just killing random people one by one in this abandoned house after this eyeball flies down their throat. Of course, he finally stops it by cutting the eyeball in half. After a bunch of other people are needlessly dead.\n\n~!Also, a kid watches his mother burn to death after she becomes possessed by the murderous eyeball.!~\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/B9JbeCY.png)\n\nThe group of ninjas in the movie were strange too and some of them had supernatural powers themselves, but nothing like this. There was a guy who could turn his skin into stone, and the main bad guy could literally force himself back to life just because his will to remain alive was just that great, even if he had his head cut clean off. Additionally, there was a \"main bad guy\" and Jubei actually had reasons and backstory to have motivation to stop him.\n\n~!Whereas the apparent \"main bad guy\" of the TV series turned out to be a miniature alien person and their actual body was apparently just a suit he controlled...? Also, robots exist, in this world as well apparently.!~\n\nAs well as because the degree of the insanity used in making these ninja abominations was much less in the movie, it also worked in the movie because it was a _movie_. Eventually, I think they just started to run out of ideas with the series. There is a ninja whose \"power\" is essentially... it can take the parts of people and animals she kills and then can attach it to herself or to others.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/ej1pBaV.png)\n\n_\"I will now combine you with a dog. Why? I don't know, why not?\"_\n\nOf course, it escalates after that point. She has her face pretty badly cut after one of her fights with Jubei, so she kills a snake and uses its skin to fix it. Then, she stumbles into a bear, kills it, and then attaches its arms to herself. BEAR ARMS. HOW DID SHE NOT WIN? Oh right, Jubei can cut through the air.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/THXYjOu.png)\n\nShe eventually got so tired of losing that she traded her limbs to another strange ninja who was mad that he had weird ugly looking limbs, because she would gain the ninja's poison powers which would perhaps make her win if bear arms didn't. Also, her arms of course choke the ninja to death after they make the trade because yeah, why not.\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/WKnVgQL.jpg)~~~ ~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/sAUVwJt.jpg)~~~ \n\nSo weird. And... here's the thing. The weirdness does not make this show any better. If anything, it makes it worse (although the eyeball episode was my favorite episode). But I guess they thought, well, we can't just do what they did with the movie. A swordsman killing relatively normal ninjas (comparing them to this) isn't enough. Yet if they had actually done that, I think it could have actually been much, much better.\n\nLike, I really don't get why there was a need for a scene where the moth ninja tries to rape the tree ninja. That sure was weird. And didn't add anything at all except I guess Jubei is the protagonist and a good guy so okay he'll stop the rape _even though she tried to kill him and his group probably not even a couple of hours before this_. \n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/4U2qT7M.png)\n\n_\"Well, a similar scene happened in the movie so...\"_\n\n________________\n\n#Conclusion#\n\nBad characters (this version of Jubei and the old man from the movie are worse), generic/uninteresting fight scenes, thin bad plot and when there is plot it's really needlessly weird, and... the opponents Jubei fights are either bad, generic, weird, or a puzzling mixture of all of the above. Carry a magical stone, protect a girl, fight some freaks, and that's thirteen episodes, we're done. Was looking for at least an average/okay and consistent action show coming from the movie, but ended up being a __3 out of 10__. \n\nMy recommendation is to watch the movie because it genuinely is much better and then just leave it at that, and pretend this doesn't exist. There's better action shows out there. _Probably._\n\n~~~img500(http://i.imgur.com/CUGhJ8Y.png)~~~"}, {"id": 2147, "score": 45, "body": "Expectations sure are a bitch! Keep them too broad and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re bound to, eventually, be met with disappointment, but we still need them to prepare ourselves whenever we began experiencing a work from the media we love. When I first began watching Denki-gai no Honya-san, I had just come out of watching the first two seasons of \u00e2\u0080\u009cWorking!!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, which remains one of my all-time favorite anime, so I wanted to experience another slice-of-life focused on the day-to-day of people at work. Being the workplace in question a manga store and the people in question passionate Otaku, people like me, I was in for a treat. It just wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the treat I was expecting.\n\nStory and Characters\n\nCredit where credit is due, the show actually makes a nice move by utilizing two distinct characters in order to develop the setting: Umio, a very passionate otaku with no restraint to displaying his affection for the hobby, is the new employee, which gives the anime the proper excuse to explain the situation of the cast; Hiotan, in the other hand, is the one character who has no experience with the one true religion of Otakudom, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in relation to her that the show gets to comment about anime, manga and other aspects of otaku culture. Not a bad setup, now allow me to explain why it fails: remember how Genshiken, for example, actually spent the first episode giving away the characters main traits and easing the protagonists in to then begin developing the conflict? Denki-gai is not very good on that. At all. Right off the bat it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to see that the series is more worried about setting the scenario than the characters, which is ironic since once the conflicts begin, this setting seems more like a backdrop to bring the cast together than something actually meaningful to the plot.\n\nThe running motif of the story here are the different couples who form amidst the various gags, so before progressing, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s do the presentations:\n\nSensei is an aspiring manga artist and the only one to seems to have what is immediately recognizable as an actual character trait, rather than a simple quirk, that of being slovenly and easily stressed. As early as the first episode, she and Umio start developing romantic feelings for each other, although it displays the most barebones chemistry possible: nice guy helps desperate girl. I realize this might sound hypocritical, given some of my favorites, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll address it properly in a moment. A running gag involving Sensei is her lack of \u00e2\u0080\u009cGirl Power\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and that happens to be one that eats away a lot of her \u00e2\u0080\u009cdevelopment\u00e2\u0080\u009d, since frequently all of the traits the show applies to her end up invariably playing to this same gag.\n\nNext is the growing bond between Hiotan, whose quirk seems to be excessive and trivial panicking, and Kantoku (director in Japanese), nicknamed this way because he apparently likes to film his employees in awkward moments. Truth be told, Kantoku seems to be the only one with the semblance of a diverse personality: he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pranker, but not a mean spirited one, which doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t clash with his behavior when he needs to act as a leader or be responsible with his employees. The way the romance between this couple springs into existence, though, is piss-poor: at one point in the story, Hiotan clings to Kantoku, initially for comedic purposes, and then begins to take his kind acts, in contrast to his usual behavior, as the result of romantic feelings, up until the show decides to treat their clich\u00c3\u00a9d, innocuous and barely eventful interactions as the marks of a \u00e2\u0080\u009csoon to be\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaybe someday\u00e2\u0080\u009d couple. Please, craft bigger quotation marks in your mind, these ones are not enough.\n\nOne relationship that seems to be already going on is the one about the backfired moe bullet Fu-girl, who is obsessed with anything related to zombies and has a mad crush on Sommelier, a tall and silent man who acquired the nickname by doing manga recommendations to the clients. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obvious that the feelings here are mutual, but none of them really progress in their efforts because both don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to properly communicate that. As I write this I noticed that none of my notes over the series actually addressed their relationship, and that is because, frankly, all that can be said I just summarized right above. The two are easily the most vapid creatures in the whole anime and their interaction is a very clear example of the general problems plaguing the show.\n\nCouples out of the way, now we can get to the lone candleholders on the block: firstly, Kameko is a girl who enjoys taking pictures with her camera (get it? CAMEra, Ko = child, get it?), who is revealed later on to have a crush on Kantoku, but got left behind for trying to keep low profile for too long. Why should the audience be invested in the late-to-show-up emotional grievance of the second most insipid block of ink in the show is not properly conveyed, but hey, at least she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not Fu-girl, whose brick-like presence and complete lack of meaningful personality drags the scene down from painfully average to just painful. Did I come off as bitter? Anyway, next in line is Tsumorin, a former employee at the shop and now a cosplay celebrity/ doujinshi author who ALSO had a crush on Kantoku. Is there any kind of projection going on here? I hope you like attempts of empathy for a character that has barely been established and offers no reason for the audience to care about, cuz this show sure is going to try! Possibly the only real reason she exists in the story is to make the idea of a romance between Hiotan and Kantoku a little more credible.\n\nOk, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dial back a bit and address the issue of Umio and Sensei, Some might find a bit hypocritical of me to criticize their dynamic, since some of my favorites (Toradora!, Working!!) have similar ones going on between their main characters. The point of my criticism, though, is not the set up itself, but the way it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s handled, which is why I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it displays good chemistry between the two, so please hold on while I attempt to expose my perspective. Building good chemistry between love interests in a story involves crafting this idea that both play off of each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personalities and visibly add something to the other part. That can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work properly if it happens to be a one-way street, as it is here: Umio acts kindly, helping Sensei with her manga, she pretends to bring out some semblance of confidence, backpedals and the situation devolves into a gag. Being fair, as a plot point, the relationship between Umio and Sensei actually does something to Umio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character, by portraying him as a very supportive person, even if in a simplistic way. That, however, never goes beyond the \u00e2\u0080\u009cnice guy/awkward girl\u00e2\u0080\u009d archetypes they are set into and the show doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t properly convey how they could really work as a couple. Truth be told, the notion that they are meant to be in a romance is kept simply by the shackles of the genre, which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all knowledgeable of already, and by how heavy-handed the anime is about it.\n\nYou might have guessed already what the main problem here is: the underdeveloped cast. At the top of the characterization pyramid is Kantoku, but even then he only reaches the Decent mark, while the rest of the crew is stuck between completely vacuous outside of a simple quirk, or one-dimensional. You may argue that the way they act within the jokes lay out more details in a subtle manner, but I think the point of having effectively subtle characterization is by getting the various traits about a character to connect in the big picture (personality), so when these traits fail to connect in a cohesive manner is that the attempts of characterization become meaningless. The point I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m trying to get with this diatribe is that the characterization in Denki-gai is disjointed and the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempts at it end up creating a shallow picture instead. To make matters worse, the romantic progression is close to nonexistent. Romances get introduced, for sure, but no proper confessions are made and whenever any kind of development (or at least what the anime passes for it) is attempted, the show seems to take a step further, just to step back and shove its head in the ground, dreadfully afraid of making the status quo any less stale.\n\nAs expected, these problems spread over to the humor too. Now, I have no issue whatsoever with establishing comedy based on character quirks; \u00e2\u0080\u009cWorking!!\u00e2\u0080\u009d has about 80% of its comedy crafted in the same principle, Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge drives this home in every chance it can get away with (which is every time) and I have no complaints with the way these shows do it. The matter of the issue here, besides the lack of additional layers to the characters to help endear them to the audience and make their reactions comically effective, is the application. In both of the shows mentioned, the quirk in which the jokes were based on was a constant, but the punchline was handled with a twist in every opportunity, either a difference in timing or the situation in which it was applied, while the same doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come out much in Denki-gai, and knowing each character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main trait makes the joke quite predictable already. This anime tried a lot, in many forms of humor, but none of them displayed the cleverness of writing required to actually pull it off and set the timing to the appropriate moments.\n\nPresentation\n\nThis is not turning out pretty. At least the presentation section comes out shorter than the Story one in my reviews.\n\nSo, how else does this anime drops the ball? Well, we have the character designs, for once. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that uncommon for different characters to have similar faces in the same anime, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s uncanny how the models in Denki-gai seem to have identical facial structures, with only hair and accessories used to differentiate them. Add to that a sickeningly excessive use of blushing and I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly call this an example of variety in visual presentation. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not kidding when I say that with a third of the show left to watch I was having pavlovian style reactions of disgust every time I saw someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face go red, Fu-girl herself I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even look at because of how much her character became an eyesore with her face that screamed \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m about to start crying desperately\u00e2\u0080\u009d in every frame.\n\nWhen it comes to the voice acting, the show is surprisingly tame for a gag manga, although this might also be an effect of how stretched out are the skits, and the acting doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reach very emphatic degrees for the genre. To be fair, this particular approach might resonate better to the comedic preferences of other viewers than they resonate with mine, so it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really a point I can use to detract from the anime. That same trait also spills over to moments that are more dedicated to \u00e2\u0080\u009ccharacterization, although perhaps with the exception of Matsuoka Yoshitsugu as Kantoku, and thank goodness for at least his presence in this anime. Fun fact: Hiotan shares the same seiyuu, Takamori Natsumi, as Miyano, from Tanaka-kun. She doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the friendly demeanor or the dedicated personality Miyano displays, though.\n\nPersonal Ramblings\n\nJust comes to show how connecting to the work in the first place helps a lot when you watch it, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot harder to find enjoyment when the first episodes failed so hard to get you involved. Sometimes I wonder how much more I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d speak highly or poorly of any work if it managed to be something I had special attachment to, or no attachment at all. Were my disposition towards a show like Steins;Gate, for example, superior to indifferent, would I be among the people shouting endless praise to it and stamping a 10/10 in my review? There were some instances, sadly not many, of my re-watch of Denki-gai when I looked at what had just played out in a scene and thought to myself \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis normally would be something I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d laugh at, if my disposition weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so low\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nThat doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand by everything I said here or in my other analysis, but it really makes me ponder how much our initial attachment or to a work can makes us more prone to catching up faster to the qualities or shortcomings it might exhibit. Tell me if you never thought about it: watching a show you already like in the first episodes makes you see more than other viewers do when getting to specific moments that might come off as meaningless to others, while if you dislike the show from the beginning the multiple little grievances stack up to form a larger problem, making the whole picture seem uglier, to the point where its qualities end up becoming mute.\n\nI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect to turn out this bitter when I first decided to write this, but among my set of opinions that have changed over the years, this one didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t turn up for the better."}, {"id": 2148, "score": 10, "body": "Question: how do you classify a work as being \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe bottom of the barrel\u00e2\u0080\u009d? For most people it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite simple, their most hated work is also the one they hold as the worst they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen. I, in the other hand, try to separate what I feel about a work from any critical judgment of it. That is not for buying any illusion of objectivity, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s simply because I feel like it would be dishonest from my part to do it. That is why I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m at the same time put off and fascinated by a work like NOiSE, one of the few that I got to classify as an absolute failure. For those who are usually annoyed by the length of my reviews, you can rest assured that this one is not going to be as long as the previous ones. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have anything positive to say about the work anyway.\n\nStory and Characters\n\nWhen elaborating a story you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d think that \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere to start?\u00e2\u0080\u009d would be among the first questions that go through the authors mind, both in regards to the setting as well as the timeframe in which the story decides to kick-off. Whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an anime or manga, the job of the first episode or chapter is to properly establish characters and setting and offer a decent hook to grab the audience\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest. The issue that is immediately apparent in NOiSE is that the series starts directly with a hook that has no setting or characters to stand on. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re introduced to two characters, the protagonist, Susono Musubi, and Clawsa, investigating a place where missing children were found dead. The chapter jumps straight into the plot, with the most basic and confusing characterization possible: there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no establishment of what kind of people these characters are, outside the fact that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re police officers, no comprehensive explanation about the setting and no proper notion of how these two elements relate to each other.\n\nYou might see here and there someone criticize a work by saying that the characters, for example, have no personality, but believe me, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not exaggerating by claiming that the characters here have little to no dimension whatsoever. Musubi has her job as a police officer as her only trait and behaves in the predictable manner for that role, Clawsa is nothing more than cannon fodder and the antagonists, two organizations called The Order and the Safeguards, have objectives and actions that are vague to the point of being nonsensical. From the bad works I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve read or seen over the years that gave me enough of an impression to award it with a score, one characteristic the majority seemed to have, at the very least, is that they were followable, something that only occasionally NOiSE barely manages to be. That is one of the traits the can lead me to call a work an absolute failure, when even following the narrative is a struggle, not for an specific writing style, but due to sheer incompetence. The details laid out by the plot don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t properly connect with each other, the information given by the characters has no ground to stand on within the line of events or the setting and I still have no idea of what the title means, for Christ sake!\n\nNow, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m someone who appreciates subtlety and the ability some works exhibit to convey meaningful information or emotion in a concise manner, reason why my favorites include series like Toradora!, Shiki and Ergo Proxy. However, there is a difference between being subtle and having no distinguishable worthwhile substance and this is a work that crosses the line going from subtlety to emptiness. I do understand that NOiSE is a prequel to BLAME!, another work of Nihei Tsutomo, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no excuse to why it couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work as a standalone story. A prequel is supposed to flesh out the world and events prior to another story and for that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s necessary to be well crafted and capable of being appreciated on its own rights. The Star Wars prequels, for once, receive particular hatred for being a bad chapter of a beloved franchise, but they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work not for being part of a larger series, it was for being bad movies in the first place.\n\nPresentation\n\nGood Lord, it seems that nothing here is salvageable! The first thing to notice about NOiSE\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presentation is that it has particularly bad use of framing. Complementing the fact that the narrative is a clusterfuck, the transition between panels is confusing, to the point I had to read some pages three times to understand how characters went from one place to another. This is, off course, not helped by the art. For once, it has very schizophrenic use of gradiance, with it being entirely absent from some chapters, while others are all in varying shades of gray. Most of the panels have stark distinction of black and white, which could be a way of conveying a gritty, hopeless cyberpunk setting, but loses its effect due to the many problems of the work and the poor quality of the drawings. If there are recurrent set pieces, they are barely recognizable, and weirdly, the art style seems remarkably afraid of straight lines, for some reason. Could be simply result of the overall poor quality or a form of conveying the crapsack nature of the world, but it generally contributes to the damage that is already being done to the presentation.\n\nPersonal Ramblings\n\nI have not seen much of Nihei Tsutomu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s works. Aside from NOiSE, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve read the first two chapters of Biomega, which were bad enough to make me drop it right there, and watched an ONA based on BLAME!. All of them displayed the same issues and gave me, overall, very little faith in anything else coming from that same author. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not curious, though!, As I sad at the beginning, a work like NOiSE fascinates me to a degree. Sometimes a movie, or manga, or anime can be bad, but also very intriguing on its own rights, compelling us into trying to grasp what was the thought process that leads to such embarrassing result. Recently, another work from Nihei Tsutomu to garner some attention was Knights of Sidonia, a 15 volume manga that was adapted into a two-season anime series, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very skeptical of its quality, but still very curious about how it fares. Whether this author has evolved and learned to do characterization and setting right or if he still has no idea on how to differentiate between subtlety and vacuity, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to find out for myself."}, {"id": 2156, "score": 5, "body": "~~~img500(http://i.imgur.com/IANWjIx.png)~~~\n\n~~~__I do not care about spoiling this show whatsoever (there's nothing even to spoil). So if you actually care about any Lance N' Masques spoilers, then take heed. Although, I should warn you if you're actually seriously considering watching this show, it's absolutely awful.__~~~\n\nBefore I even _start_, let's talk about this show's opening. I usually don't even talk about the opening of a show, but this is a special case. Normally, an opening shows a show's characters or glimpses of scenes to give like a preview of the show itself before it actually begins. \n\nFor Lances n' Masques, the opening is the main little girl character awakening in unfamiliar surroundings all alone, screaming and crying. But then, _THEN_, an angel almost identical to the girl descends from the stars, kisses her hand, and then starts flying with her in tow. The little girl smiles ecstatically as the angel flies off with her deep into the darkness of the cosmos. They are flying off deep into the darkness and they are as happy as can be as the cheery music continues on.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/4cQUkU8.png)\n\nYes. Yes, that is the perfect opening! Have you heard of a certain saying by a certain German philosopher? \"Wer mit Ungeheuern k\u00c3\u00a4mpft, mag zusehn, dass er nicht dabei zum Ungeheuer wird. Und wenn du lange in einen Abgrund blickst, blickt der Abgrund auch in dich hinein!\"\n\nIn English of course, it translates to: \"He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster. And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.\"\n\nWhy am I quoting Nietzsche in an anime review? _Because this show is the equivalent of staring into the abyss._\n\n____\n\n#Introduction#\n\nBut I digress. This anime is an adaptation of the same titled [novel](http://anilist.co/manga/86302/LanceNMasques) by [Hideaki Koyasu](http://anilist.co/staff/103836/HideakiKoyasu). It's about... it's about... uhhhh... an organization of knights that for some reason still exist in the modern era, I guess? Or wait no, it's about a cute horse girl character. No hold on, it's about a little girl who's lonely and for some reason her father doesn't even let her go to school. No wait, it's about this teenager knight who doesn't want to be a knight but he can't resist his knight instincts and therefore MUST do knightly things. Also, he basically has a harem.\n\nIt's a combination of all of these things, actually. It's an action fantasy comedy slice of life amoeba that just scoots around on the floor between all of these things and never really stopping. You don't really want to touch it because it's slimy and looks disgusting but it won't stop.\n\n____\n\n#Characters (Or the ones that matter anyways)#\n\nimg200(http://i.imgur.com/OahaXdW.png)\n\nThat's pretty much all of them right there. \n\nThe Knight Teenager, Youtarou Hanabusa. His entire character is he runs away from home because his whole life he's been raised/indoctrinated to be a knight. He must rescue all of the girls in distress and always, ALWAYS kiss their hand because that is... that's what chivalry is, right? Yeah, there's nothing more chivalrous than a masked weirdo going around with a gigantic metal lance kissing the hands of young girls. Point is, he wants to live a normal life and break out of his \"White Knight Syndrome\" as he... as he calls it.\n\nThe Little Girl, Makio Kidouin. A little girl Youtarou just happens to run into as she's about to fall. Youtarou puts on his mask, catches her, and does the thing where he kisses the girl's hand. Immediately she's in love with this weird masked guy she calls \"Knight Lancer\" and isn't aware that Youtarou is him when he's unmasked despite how obvious it is. The mask doesn't even cover his entire face, they have the same hair color, and Youtarou is always carrying a thing wrapped up on his back that is the size of the lance that \"Knight Lancer\" uses. Whatever, it's not important.\n\nPoint is, Makio is forced to live by herself in a mansion by her father, and is not even allowed to go to school. Youtarou immediately decides that this is not okay and basically ends up living with her because chivalry I GUESS? (His knight friends and etc of course also end up living there too).\n\nThe other girl isn't important. She's Youtarou's squire, I guess. Her parts become lesser as the amount of female characters around Youtarou steadily increases.\n\nThere's more female characters that join Youtaro's group but I honestly don't remember a single one of them I guess beyond the one they start treating as/who starts acting as Youtarou/\"Knight Lancer\" and Makio's daughter for some reason (???). \n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/Q6PFE7t.png)\n\nThe Sadist Maid... actually, I've already forgotten her name (it was Yoriko). But she's basically the one who raised and trained Youtarou in the ways of the White Knight, and is actually one of the strongest Knights despite just being appearing as a maid. Her Knight name was something like \"Throne of Blood\" or something even though there's really no blood in this show and nobody ever dies.\n\nThere's also a boy (???, he/she dresses as a maid for some reason in the later episodes) character who usually has a dual set of pistols and occasionally pistol whips and kidnaps one of the girl characters.  \n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/47OBqPk.jpg)\n \nFinally, there's Shirohime. As you may have guessed by process of elimination and the fact that she's on there _twice_, she is the most important character of the entire anime. For she is the horse girl character, and everyone knows anthropomorphic horse girls are cu\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/X6IAceT.png)\n\n___\n\n#There's a main plot somewhere#\n\nOkay, the entire show is basically just \"_Blank_ gets kidnapped and gets saved by _blank_ after they fight _blank_.\" but there are arcs and one lasts long enough to where I'm capable of calling it probably the closest thing to a main plot this has. \n\n~!The actual overall main plot is Youtaro deciding he wants to be an actual knight despite him running away initially in an attempt to escape it. But he ran into Makio and Makio is his \"princess\" who he must protect and ugh. Just UGH.!~\n\nI'll list them off real quickly. I could tear into all of them but I'm only doing one outside of some key points.\n\n__Makio Arc (episodes 1-3):__ Youtaro takes it upon himself to move into Makio's house with his squire, horse, and maid because he's worried about Makio being lonely. Makio's father then decides to have her moved overseas and as a result Youtaro decides to _successfully kidnap her_ to prevent her actual father from moving her.\n\n__Yufeng Arc (Episodes 4-5):__ Another girl gets kidnapped, a girl tries to kill the pistols kid who was the one who kidnapped Makio before, Yufeng (that was her name) starts living with the others and Makio decides that Yufeng is her and Youtaro/Knight Lancer's daughter.\n\n__Hot Springs Arc (Episode 6):__ In response to the folly of having a hot springs episode when the cast is primarily female, they make the one male character (THE PROTAGONIST) crossdress as a maid. Isn't he a knight? I can't recall any legendary knights of yore being made to crossdress.  \n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/9ZKur9d.png)\n\n__Youtaro Gets Kidnapped! Arc (Episode 7-10):__ I would argue that this is the closest to an actual... arc, this show gets. It's also probably the worst part of this show. And thus, it's the one I'll be tearing into momentarily.\n\n__African Kights/Youtaro's Father Arc (Episode 11-12):__ The show should have just ended with episode ten. Instead no, let's introduce a new rival faction of  knights and oh wait, we only have two episodes left, WE STILL HAVE TO GET YOUTARO'S FATHER IN THERE TOO. Let's have him wipe out the entirety of the \"African Knights\" within seconds so he can have the whole last episode to himself.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/um6m6Mw.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/AhwqaCi.png)\n\n_\"Even when people do die in this universe, their corpses just become colorful balls of light. No graves needed.\"_\n\n~!Also, there's a perfect opportunity where they could have had Youtarou actually get on Shirohime and like joust battle his father. He's going all \"Okay, that's it, I'm a knight! I'll stop you!\" and the entire show he's never rode his steed not once (I was actually wrong, he rides the horse ONE time) . Shirohime approaches him and you think he's actually gonna get on the horse and be a goddamned knight but instead, Shirohime reverts to horse girl mode and begs Youtarou to not fight his own father. And of course, his father gets off of his horse as well. As an anime about knights, Lances n' Masques had one job. Just a single jousting battle. But nope. Lances are better used when NOT on a horse, apparently.!~\n\n~!Also, not that it even matters, but they don't give any reason for why knights still exist, let alone a global organization of them, in the modern day. There's some mention of like an evil organization by one of the three only other male knights shown, but he says he had already basically crushed it... so what is their purpose other than \"knights\"...??? Again, it doesn't even matter but still !~\n\n___\n\n#The Worst and Longest \"Arc\"#\n_\"Here comes the one and only major spoiler of note, watch out!\"_\n\nFollowing the hot springs episode, a bunch of other knights show up and beat up and subsequently kidnap Youtarou. \n\n\"Oh no, the knight has been kidnapped! Now, it's up to the female characters to rescue the knight!\"  \n\nAlso, I thought they kidnapped him because he actually broke free and escaped the knight island and there was like some sort of law in their knight organization like: \"Once a white knight, always a white knight. Those that break free of the indoctrination put into place since childhood shall be rounded up and executed.\" Things took a darker turn however when it was revealed the entire purpose of kidnapping him was that the Knight Chief wanted Youtarou...\n\n_...Sexually._\n\nExcuse me? WHAT? ___YOUTAROU ALMOST GETS RAPED BY AN ELDERLY MUSCULAR BUFF WOMAN KNIGHT IN THE BATH SCENE (GONE SEXUAL 2015 ANIME PRANKS).___\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/z7pboS0.png)~~~ ~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/U0tr4PQ.png)~~~ ~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/8AClsUZ.png)~~~ ~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/aKIw53E.png)~~~\n\nI should clarify if it wasn't clear. NO. NOTHING ABOUT THIS IS OKAY. I WAS ALREADY THINKING THAT THIS KNIGHT ORGANIZATION WAS MESSED UP FROM THE GET GO. SHE IS THE LEADER OF THESE KNIGHTS, SHE WAS THE ONE WHO MADE YOUTAROU'S STUPID MASK THING BACK WHEN HE WAS A KID.\n\n THE REST OF THIS ARC IS JUST THE FEMALE CHARACTERS PUTTING ON THEIR OWN KNIGHT MASK THINGS AND DOING GENERIC BATTLES WITH THE OTHER KNIGHTS AND I WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE A SECTION DEDICATED TO THIS \"ARC\" IF NOT FOR THIS. THERE IS NO OTHER REASON SPECIFIED OR EXPLAINED WHY THEY KIDNAP YOUTAROU OTHER THAN THE KNIGHT CHIEF _WANTS HIM_.\n\nTHE KNIGHTS SERVING HER ARE GETTING INTO \"FIGHTS TO THE DEATH\" (again, nobody dies in this show) AND THIS IS HER REASON FOR STARTING ALL OF THIS CHAOS. NOT, I WANT YOUTAROU TO COME BACK TO THE ISLAND AND GO BACK TO BEING A KNIGHT AGAIN BECAUSE HE ESCAPED BEFORE, BUT BECAUSE OF THIS.\n\n\"ISN'T THAT JUST A GENERIC ANIME ABOUT KNIGHTS?\"\n\nNOPE, APPARENTLY NOT. HOLY SHIT.\n\nAlso later at the end of this arc: _\"I'm promoting you to Arch Knight because I did almost rape you.\"_\n\nI was honestly convinced that this show couldn't get any worse and then they threw that at me.\n\n___\n\n#Conclusion#\n\nThis was... one of the most grating and excruciating things I've watched in a long while. I underestimated this show. I thought it was going to be bad, I figured it was going to be bad, but holy hell. I have stared into the abyss and I have somehow narrowly escaped as the creatures in the darkness tried to drag me down with them. What score do I give it? I don't know. A __5 out of a 100__ sounds good.\n\nI will say this. I hate this show, but an interestingly/horribly bad anime is better in my opinion than a bad anime that is also boring. I don't know where I was going with that, but I'm sure there's a point there somewhere.\n\n~~~img500(http://i.imgur.com/5Tee2tA.png)~~~"}, {"id": 2157, "score": 45, "body": "~~~img500(http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fmDyo7px0gM/TFhwsTPD9PI/AAAAAAAAATQ/mooaVhhNHDI/s1600/lalalalal2.JPG)~~~\n\n_\"A gory violent horror sci-fi action romance series featuring an immortal samurai who wanders around while being forced to live forever as the world changes around him. You've got my attention. I'm not expecting anything, but you've got my attention.\"_\n____\n\n#Introduction#\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/TDLNf6b.jpg)\n\nKurozuka is an adaptation by Madhouse of the [manga](http://anilist.co/manga/30967/Kurozuka) by [Takashi Noguchi](http://anilist.co/staff/97775/TakashiNoguchi) which itself is an adaptation of the novel by [Baku Yumemakura](http://anilist.co/staff/97026/BakuYumemakura). It begins as a dark action romance series and then transitions into sci-fi territory as the protagonist awakes in a ruined and post-apocalyptic world and starts fighting futuristic soldiers. Also, why not throw the vampire angle in the mix to mix it up?\n\nIt could have been a reasonably okay action series. Not everything has to have an amazing deep plot. Sometimes, I do occasionally just go: \"I want to just watch something where a guy just kills a bunch of guys.\" There's really nothing wrong with that, in my opinion.\n\nBut of course, there is a plot behind all of the action and gore. And... that's partially where it all goes wrong. The swordsman Minamoto no Yoshitsune/Kurou along with his friend Benkei is fleeing from his brother who wishes to take his life. Historically, Yoshitsune was believed to have eventually been forced to commit seppeku following the defeat of his retainers and Benkei. In Kurozuka, Benkei and Kurou end up meeting a strange woman who lives in the middle of nowhere named Kuromitsu.\n\nKurou and Kuromitsu end up falling in love, Kurou finds out that Kuromitsu is in fact a vampire,  Kurou's pursuers attack them and Kuromitsu floats the offer of becoming a vampire to live with her forever until literally _the end of time_ to a fatally wounded Kurou who says \"Sure, why not.\"\n\nAll of this basically happens in the first two episodes. Then, there's an immediate and sudden transition to Kurou waking up in a forest and then seeing the standing ruins of modern civilization.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/Ll96cyo.jpg)\n\n___\n\n#It's all downhill from here.#\n\n\"He learns that he is unable to die and continues to live for a thousand years as Japan evolves into a future society.\"\n\nAdmittedly, this very much is on me. From that line, I had expected that the show was going to be about this immortal swordsman actually living throughout that thousand years. That would have been cool, an immortal samurai watching as the world changes and then eventually descends into this ruined dystopian hellhole? Would have been great.\n\nInstead, we only see flashes of that occasionally dispersed here and there. Kurou becomes a vampire, gets his head chopped off, and then wakes up in a forest and we're already to the post-apocalyptic portion of the show. Which is... arguably the worst and largest part of the show?\n\nYou get two episodes of this:\n\nimg440(http://31.media.tumblr.com/b48e411378d40e95ce827b22f7f0fce5/tumblr_mr8nhsr7YS1rydwbvo1_500.gif)\n\nThen after that, it's just Kurou killing guys with guns. These guys are armored and have assault rifles, but this lone swordsman is capable of killing all of them with ease. But hey, maybe his immortality also makes him a killing machine. Like I said before, action is fine, I like action, but like the first Kurou action scene following the transition into post-apocalyptic times has him stealing one of these soldiers' pistol and straight up shooting them _point blank to death._\n\nDon't even get me started on this bunch of human \"characters\" that then get introduced that are like this rebel organization that's against the \"Red Army\" which is the ruling faction originating from the people who found out that Kuromitsu was a vampire in the first part of the show. This group of humans is really just there to die more or less. Each and every one of them are completely forgettable and they _drop off like flies_.\n\nThere continues to be scenes of flashbacks about Kurou and Kuromitsu because you can't forget this is also a romance, but the romance (the whole purpose of the show following episode two is Kurou is now trying to get Kuromitsu back from the \"Red Army\" or whatever) mostly boils down to: ~!Kurou got decapitated too soon after being turned into a vampire, causing him to have to have his head removed and put on a new body because his body eventually begins to start to break down or he gets amnesia or something. Kuromitsu happily decapitates Kurou every so often after Kurou himself unknowingly kills the person whose body he'll be taking, and then Kuromitsu eventually leaves him unconscious in the woods to repeat the whole endeavor again _until the literal end of time as she previously promised_.!~\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/hKh8U53.jpg)\n\nThere are also these super soldier/mutant guys created by the \"Red Army\" in experiments using Kuromitsu's blood but... like one dressed like he was a turtle, another one had control of vines for some reason. Spoilers, Kurou kills them all. Because while he became an immortal through Kuromitsu's blood as well, he's outright unstoppable unlike these super soldiers/mutants.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/sdPtzaU.png)\n\nRemember how I said the human characters drop off like flies? There is a point where Kurou is carrying the last surviving human of this group and just out of nowhere, gets immediately shot in the head, and she's dead. The person who fires the gun had the jump on and could have totally fired at Kurou instead, but purposely aims at the person Kurou is carrying instead. To be fair, the character that does this has literally gone insane and proceeds to shoot at a bunch of windows and laugh maniacally to himself as he does it. But still.\n\n_\"Well, we need to get to rid of this last human character. Let's just have her get shot in the head and be done with it.\"_\n\nOh yeah, he also then kicks her corpse out of one of the windows. Just because.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/GuDV0BA.png)\n\nAt about that point, you realize you're at episode eleven, and you just want this to end already. You've long since grown tired of the action and even tired of the blood. But you have to see how it ends. That's when they bust out one of the most possible cliches they could have thought of:~!Benkei, you bastard. YOU'RE AN IMMORTAL TOO. I bet Kurou's gonna have a fight to the death with you since you betrayed him, are in love his with his vampire lady, and became immortal after decapitating him and accidentally somehow tasting his blood in the mess following the decapitation. ...What? The fight lasted literally seconds and Benkei's dead? Oh, come on...!~\n\nThen, one of the most nonsense weird \"nothing\" endings I've ever seen happens.\n\n~!Kuromitsu congratulates Kurou for killing all of the bad guys and makes him aware that oh whoops your princess is in another castle AND DECAPITATES HIM THEN EMBRACES HIS SEVERED HEAD WHILE NUDE AND TELLS HIM YOU HAVE TO KEEP KILLING PEOPLE TO BE WITH ME FOR ALL OF ETERNITY BECAUSE WE ARE BOTH _IMMORTAL VAMPIRE MONSTERS_. Kurou just wants to die but nope, he's attached to a new body, wakes up in the woods again, and oh look... the world's not ruined anymore/has been reset somehow (the lady that got shot and kicked out of a window is shown to be alive again) and then... it shows Minamoto no Yoshitsune and Benkei from the beginning again. \"I have been dreaming.\" So, it was all a dream? AND THERE'S THE CREDITS. !~\n\n~!img440(http://i.imgur.com/BF8lmjh.png)!~\n\n______\n\n#Conclusion#\n\nAll action series do not have to have the most super in-depth or intricate plot (if the action is enjoyable/entertaining on its own). But there are action series that do have reasonably okay or perhaps even good or better stories to them. Kurozuka tries to have a plot (required disclaimer of the manga seems to be different from the anime) but it's... a disjointed and weird mess (going immediately from samurai times to post-apocalyptic is not okay). Whatever enjoyment the action provides grows very thin by the final episode, and the romance of Kurozuka is...\n\nThe whole point is Kurou is trying to get to Kuromitsu and his reward for it?\n\n~!Being repeatedly decapitated by her. Any love present goes immediately out of the window the moment decapitations enter the picture.!~\n\nIf you're looking for not an amazing action series, I could maybe see an argument for this one just because of how weird/strange it actually is. I give it a score of __4.5 out of 10__ or __45 out of 100__.\n\n~~I watched this months ago and the [opening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUf2RrSvpJM) is still stuck in my head.~~\n\n~~~img500(http://i.imgur.com/lhmejKA.jpg)~~~"}, {"id": 2160, "score": 30, "body": "~~~img500(http://i.imgur.com/MWvzWXG.jpg)~~~\n\n\"I spy you. You're under arrest for espionage.\" _~An actual real line of dialogue from this show about spies._\n\n____\n\n#Introduction#\n\nThis show is an adaptation of a series of novels by [Koji Yanagi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koji_Yanagi). It's a show about a spy agency in the 1930's. There's no \"main plot\", although there's occasionally a couple of episodes that are actually linked together. More or less it's episodic, an episode about a spy on a train here, an episode about a spy on a boat there. Choosing to go for a more episodic feel is fine depending on how you do it.\n\nIf it was just a bunch of interesting or entertaining spy missions, it would have been fine. But that's not really what it is. It really just feels like... \"Okay, let's do a show about spies. There will be spies and they will be doing spy things.\" Invisible ink? That's a spy thing. Anti-amnesia training? That's a spy thing. Truth serum? Yeah man, throw it in. We gotta scrape the entirety of the bottom of the barrel. Actually, you know what? Let's be a little different, let's raise the stakes.\n\nTRUTH SERUM WASN'T ENOUGH, THERE'S ALSO AN ANTI-TRUTH SERUM AS A COUNTER. BOOYEAH, THOSE AMERICAN SPIES JUST GOT ___OUT SPIED___. Wait, no. This is all wrong. We need interesting characters and interesting writing, not more generic spy thi--\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/EWo5Ft4.png)\n\n_\"Also, this is a real human being.\"_\n\n______\n\n#A Lack of Interesting Characters#\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/9Qym2II.jpg)\n\n_Not pictured: two other spies, and the old spy who is of course the spymaster as he is the best spy because he is old._\n\nThroughout most of the anime, these guys are only rarely ever shown together. Also, we get their names like once in the first episode and like right after it's made clear that their names are spy names and therefore fake. Basically, none of their names matter, because there's no possible way you're going to actually remember or be able to tell any of these spies apart.\n\nThere's... there's nothing there. They're all just spies and that's basically it. There were only two characters that I actually even still remember. \n\nFirst was the guy from the first two episodes who I initially believed was going to be the main character (he would become a spy and that would be the show) that in fact wasn't an actual spy but instead a military guy who had a tendency of saying how much he wanted to kill himself because that was more honorable than being a spy. But after the second episode, it goes mostly completely episodic and the guy I believed was going to be a main character shows up I think... once or twice after that.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/JXXPBnu.jpg)\n\n_Japanese man almost goaded into commiting seppeku by American spy (anime 2016 spy pranks)._\n\nSecond of course, is the old spymaster character, Yuuki. He's only memorable because he shows up in most of the episodes because he's... well, the spymaster. Also, there's a whole episode dedicated to showing what you're supposed to believe is Yuuki's past, only for them to immediately go \"Well no, that was this other guy. Maybe some details of all of that also fits Yuuki's actual past though.\" Wow, thanks. At least you _tried_ to have ONE character.\n\nI couldn't honestly look at that picture up there and say. \"Well, the guy who's in the brown suit was the spy who was the one who was in the train episode. The guy in the black suit was the one in the boat episode, and so forth.\" I honestly have no idea which one was which.\n\n___\n\n#All you had to do was do a show about spies.#\n\nThe only point where this show even manages to be anywhere near okay was towards the end when it was about Yuuki's past and the rivalry between \"D Agency\" (Yuuki's spy agency) and the spy agency that actually kills people. Oh yeah, by the way, \"D Agency\" never kills people. Pacifist spies sure are interesting and neat. Don't get me wrong, they didn't have to be like assassins... but have you ever heard of a little term called ___loose ends___?\n\nYet, everyone is utterly incapable of identifying or besting a single one of these pacifist spies.\n\nThere is an episode where one of the spies goes to infiltrate a rebel group of literally like three people and one of those people is a German mole. The nonsensery of that aside, the episode literally starts with a firing squad about to open fire on an old woman tied to the tree SOLELY because she was being annoying. The spy character for that episode saves the old woman, has his head bonked which gives him amnesia, but he still remembers how to be a spy because of specialized spy training in case of amnesia, then has his head bonked again and that cures him of amnesia. _You can't make this up._\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/U91KaQY.jpg)~~~ ~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/kA32bEa.png)~~~\n\n_\"Stack up enough head injuries and I'm sure it'll work out in the end.

You know the thing where I make a bluff about some letter that I can't prove actually exists? If you kill me, that'll get sent to the authorities with due haste! Also, I hope this chap with this gun to my back doesn't end up shooting you instead for you are the bad guy of this situation! Oh ho! He did exactly what I predicted! Called it, you foolish buffoon!\"\n\nAlso, there's a dead child in the mix with the explosion because dead children = tragedy. Also, the dead child dressed like a girl and was a waitress/sex worker (???), and the guy who killed the bad guy did so because he loved him/her. That's... what even was that episode about again???\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/gIjpp9M.png)\n\nThere's nothing much to say about the boat episode (the guy would have survived if he had just ignored the crossword puzzle) or the train episode (spy dude kept a pigeon in his shirt for an entire seven hour train ride). The episode with the truth serum as well as the anti-truth serum was probably the closest to doing spies. Spy guy is captured by American spies and being interrogated and has to escape from this building all spylike. Oh yeah, this show's about ___spies!___\n\n~!Also, this is just a general thing but don't end your show on a line from the first episode. [Please.](http://anilist.co/anime/21189/RanpoKitanGameofLaplace) \"Oh hey, that was from the first episode. They didn't have anything else better to end on?\"!~\n\n____\n\n#Conclusion#\n\nDid you know that this show was about spies? Completely uninteresting spies lacking any sort of personality or depth doing spy things, but spies nonetheless! Invisible ink! Truth serum! These are spy things! \n\nMost episodes are either generic or boring, others are downright baffling (the amnesia episode, the a building got bombed episode), but the episodes that are more about Yuuki (the old one) are almost pretty okay in comparison.  \n\nBut to be honest, did there really need to be 8-10 different spy characters anyways? There could have just been a couple and maybe they could have actually given them personalities but instead, every episode has to be a new (yet completely interchangeable with the others) spy. To be fair though, this is an adaptation of a novel series and _blah blah blah._\n\nA score of __3 out of 10__. Not the worst thing I've watched, but wouldn't recommend actually watching it. It's more towards the boring end of the spectrum. Although, I had a laugh in keeping track of all of the spy clich\u00c3\u00a9s as I watched it.\n\n__BONUS:__ I give the [Joker Game specials](http://anilist.co/anime/21790/JOKERGAMEKuronekoYorunoBouken) about a cat that foils a bunch of guys' attempt to bring down the \"D Agency\"  a __4 out of 10__. Because even though it was very brief, it had all of the different spy guys actually together and interacting with each other. It actually almost fooled me into thinking \"Oh yeah, these guys are actual characters.\" Also, I'm fine with the thought that without this stray cat, this spy agency would have literally been taken down, being my final thought on this series.\n\n~~~img500(http://i.imgur.com/SLRIYRQ.jpg)~~~"}, {"id": 2166, "score": 35, "body": "~~~img500(http://i.imgur.com/w4YOC1e.jpg)~~~\n\n_\"Hold on... is... is my computer screen stained or dirty or something? What the hell is with the left side?\"_\n\n___\n\n#Introduction#\n\nNot going to lie, I wouldn't have even watched this show in the first place if the episodes weren't only ten minutes each/if it weren't for the RotK angle. Digressing, this show is an adaptation of a [Chinese manhua series by Bai Mao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_Buster) which itself is based off that sort of famous [Romance of the Three Kingdoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_of_the_Three_Kingdoms) by [Luo Guanzhong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luo_Guanzhong). As someone who has read RotK and is big into it, I should put this out there right away.\n\nPerhaps Bai Mao used his own fictional characters rather than the RotK/actual Ancient Chinese generals or perhaps it's just that the names are different, but I could honestly recognize only one of the generals that show up in the entirety of Soul Buster and that's just because he appears very similar to how he appears in other RotK adaptation things (his appearance is more or less the exact same as he appeared in Dynasty Warriors).\n\n_\"Okay, a female warrior with white hair, don't know who she's supposed to be, but she's the \"main\" general I guess. Oh, wait. Who's that now, who shows up right in the opening but is a major plot point?_ \n\n~!\"_Oh, that's just straight up fucking Guan Yu. Like no debating it whatsoever..\"_!~\n\n~!img440(http://i.imgur.com/EkZkf1K.png)!~\n\nAncient Chinese/Romance of the Three Kingdoms stuff aside, it's a show where people come out of cards and battle with each other. There's really not much to say about the actual action beyond that. That being said though, it was... acceptable.\n\nIf it wasn't for everything else, I could probably call it perfectly average.\n\n___\n\n#Only the required amount of plot and character#\n\nOkay, the general premise is that a blue haired teenager has a dream and in it he finds himself in the Ancient China times and there's this undead emperor guy who's going on about how someone stole his heart. The teenager runs away but accidentally finds the evil emperor's heart and somehow doing that gives it back to the emperor himself? Mind you, this all just happened in a dream this teenager had. Apparently, the teenager can alter history/time through his dreams.\n\nThen... the undead emperor of the Kan (Han?) dynasty gains the ability to alter history and time and apparently just completely changes history? Or attempt to? And then the game of \"Soul Buster\" became a thing and the generals had their souls sealed into cards so the rest of their existence would be unending battles with each other or being trapped in this empty dimension???\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/J6vgGdR.png)\n\nThere's a lot of weirdness here if you bother to even look closer. But you're not supposed to. There's action scenes. This teenager is literally just a teenager, that's his whole character. Just watch the card people battle like you're supposed to, don't focus on the undead emperor who literally devours people's souls/altering history aspect.\n\nAlso, yeah of course the teenager's history teacher just happens to play this violent and deadly card game involving summoning the spirits of Ancient Chinese generals.\n\nOh yeah, the high school is also named Three Kingdoms High. Get it? Like the Three Kingdoms as in the Romance of the Three Kingdo--\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/ssRYI5v.png)\n\n___\n\n#Just put a bunch of stuff over the show itself. It'll make it better.#\n \nFor whatever reason, they apparently decided that the anime needed something more. Thus, they added this terrible overlay effect to every second of every episode of the anime. Sometimes, it's not super noticeable, but it's always there.  Perhaps the thought behind it was to give the show its own sort of unique look that only it has? But, it's only ever bothersome and looks... bad.\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/9TaH8Ee.png)~~~ ~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/p3G8hEW.png)~~~\n\nI don't really know what made this seem like a good idea. But, if it was just that, I would have probably waved it off. Like okay yeah sure, it looks ~~terrible~~ bad but it doesn't make me want to fully stop watching. It's partway into the first episode that it's revealed to the viewer that whenever ANYTHING happens in this show, random colorful splotches will bombard the screen. A character being summoned from their card to the fight scenes, splotches for all. They happen in all twelve episodes. __For no reason whatsoever other than well okay here are some splotches.__\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/N8fqZFd.png)~~~ ~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/1oeuHNH.png)~~~ ~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/adIh1KB.png)~~~ ~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/vqWOAHt.png)~~~\n\n___Why.___ This isn't... there's no purpose for the splotches. It's just more stuff on the screen covering up the actual show that's going on. Who thought these were good ideas? In trying to make the show more unique/less generic (\"Well, no other show has these splotches.\"), it's actually making the show worse.\n\nI just don't get what they were going for. But now, this show is burned into my brain as _that show with the splotches._\n\n___\n\n#Conclusion#\n\nA would be average show if only the characters and the \"plot\" were to be judged on their own, gets dragged down by the appearance of the show itself. I wouldn't recommend to actually watch it (even if you're looking for generic action, there's better out there) but you know, as previously stated, the episodes are only ten minutes long each. It's still not the worst \"TV Short\" I've watched/that's out there.  Splotch Buster gets a __3.5 out of 10__ or a __35 out of 100__.\n\n~~~img500(http://i.imgur.com/vDZ3nCC.png)~~~"}, {"id": 2183, "score": 48, "body": "Ah, Naruto. The anime adaptation of Masashi Kishimoto's long running shounen manga finally ends (though on the backend of some light novel adaptations and only a couple of weeks before the anime original Boruto anime starts, but I digress.)  Busting into the 2000s alongside One Piece and Bleach as one of the Big 3, Naruto has been a phenomenon in the anime industry as one of the best selling manga of all time, and one of the exceptionally long running shows in the mainstream, ending at a total of 720 episodes.\n\nNow, it's hard to talk about Naruto critically without offending anyone. On one hand you have it's diehard fans who cannot bear to fault it for anything, and on the other hand you might have some naysayers who will claim that it has no merit whatsoever. I may be conveniently generalizing but I think there is certainly some dissonance between people who love it and people who think it's just absolute trash. I personally did not grow up with it like I did Dragon Ball for example, so there is no nostalgia factor for me. I started watching it when I was 18, so I can't look at it and feel a magic that I felt from when I was younger, however I do understand the sentiment. Discovering a massive, bulky fictional universe with an enormous amount of characters is one of the most exciting things for a kid, and if Naruto has anything it's a bountiful amount of characters and worldbuilding, which does stir up the \"kid\" in me since I love both of those things. However I can understand the other side who can't ignore a lot of Naruto's flaws.\n\nSpecifically starting with the story of Naruto Shippuden, since it's like an anime branding sequel to Naruto (like how Z was to the original Dragon Ball), if you ignore the ridiculous amount of filler between the last arc in the original Naruto anime (Sasuke Retrieval) and the beginning of Shippuden, it started out bombastically. The biggest thing I will give Naruto Shippuden credit for is that, aside from filler, episodes 1-175 were incredibly well-paced and about as tightly adapted as you could possibly make that portion of the series. It is by far the best part of the anime and it has most of it's best moments within this timeframe. I don't really think any of it's contemporaries have matched the quality of that stretch either.\n\nNow from the start of the Five Kage Summit (sigh) and onwards, Naruto Shippuden really goes through a 250 episode stretch of abhorrent mediocrity, if it wasn't filler at the time. Although Five Kage Summit has some good moments, it's when it gets to The Fourth Shinobi World War Arc where the rest of the show falls flat. This arc is laughably bad for many reasons, but on a fundamental level this arc was already awfully drawn out in the manga. You couple that with the anime studio grasping for straws to draw things out either with excessive monologuing or flashbacks so they could schedule their semi-decent key animators to work on cuts that fans actually cared about or just outright throwing fillers in the middle of nowhere. There is also the fact that their A-team who made the beginning of Shippuden so great were busy working on Naruto: The Last and Boruto: Naruto the Movie for most of the duration of this story arc in the anime (which are both very well animated movies by the way if you haven't watched them yet). I could go on and on about how awful this arc is, about how a \"Naruto Kai\" couldn't even redeem it, or how it makes the entirety of the Naruto anime unrecommendable to someone who hasn't started it, but I will leave it at that.\n\nFor characters, there's not much going on here. I will say that the anime is better than the manga at executing emotional moments between characters, which is the real strength of Naruto's characterizations. Naruto definitely has a plethora of characters, and they definitely go through \"development\", as in a lot of things happen that don't happen to the average 13-26 episode anime character. You have like a baker's dozen or so of characters who go through hundreds and hundreds of episodes full of development. That is a double edged sword, on one hand they are defined well. You could leave Naruto, pick it up a year or two later and you don't really need to explore their character again (if not for a lack of caring). That being said this extensive amount of development will turn a lot of people away, since you have this \"quality vs. quantity\" factor, a lot of people will say that you should be able to execute worthwhile character writing in a much shorter amount of time, and that is definitely a fair argument. If you strip the well done emotional execution of particular moments throughout the series, and put the characters on paper, there's not much going for me.\n\nOn a thematic level, Naruto is back and forth on a lot of things. It definitely lacks subtlety for it's messages, since its a long running manga it has the liberty of spelling everything out for you. Kishimoto is definitely a sentimental writer, who has a lot of ideals about politics and family, etc. There are questionable decisions however. ~!For example, he sets up Naruto as an underdog character. He is bullied and his whole town is against him as a child because he has the fox demon who ravaged the village when he was born sealed inside him. You fast forward to the ending of Shippuden and he is practically a Messianic figure. You have an underdog character who was born with the talent for greatness, it defeats the whole purpose of an underdog story. How are people who identify as an underdog supposed to identify with the Messianic Naruto?!~ Not for a lack of trying, the anime does nail thematic execution, albeit rarely. Probably my favorite moment in particular was the backstory explaining how Naruto was born. I don't really think you can claim that Naruto is without merit if you don't at least get to this part of the story, because it's beautiful and well done.\n\nArtstyle, I wouldn't say it's anything special. The characters are definitely defined by design, and starting with Shippuden the animation character designs are appealing and consistent, especially for the challenge that is long running anime. This is something Pierrot has excelled at in comparison to its biggest competitor, Toei Animation. Though this crashes again during the last arc, up until the last 20 episodes or so. Naruto can be misleading when it comes to it's OPs, if you've seen any of them (most famously OP 17 / Silouhette by KANA-BOOM, if you haven't seen it stop reading this and go watch that right now) they are incredibly stylized with beautiful palette choices. If you watch the actual show, the colors are very boring. There are moments in the first part of series that I talked about earlier that does some good things with artstyle, especially scenery. I really love the way fight scenes looked in Amegakure, the directing used the gloomy aesthetic and atmosphere to it's advantage.\n\nThough it might come to the surprise at some, animation is another strong point of Naruto... for the most part. There are definitely some 'meme-betweens' as I like to call them (Sasuke's \"I CAN SEE YOU!\" or Pain's \"My pain is greater than yours!\"), but Naruto Shippuden's peaks are surprisingly high quality for a long-running shounen. There is a lot of material for people who are foaming at the teet for sakuga. Again, this quality leaves for the majority for the second half of the show, though there are a handful of incredible fight scenes as well. ~!The Naruto vs. Sasuke fight towards the end of the series is honestly one of the best directed and well animated fight scenes in the history of TV anime. !~\n\nThe biggest merit I have for Naruto Shippuden is definitely the music. There are some absolutely iconic anime OSTs on this series, such as Heaven-Shaking Event, Sengunbanba, Shitsui, to name a few. There are so many though and they are used well for sure. If there's a flaw, in the soundtrack, I'd stretch to say that I wish Yasuharu Takanashi made more music to keep the show fresher, then again not much could redeem the second half. \n\nIf you scrolled down just to see my rating, you're probably wondering \"isn't it a waste of time to spend hundreds and hundreds of episodes and rate it that low\"? That's a good question. I enjoy anime. When I say there is a lot I don't like about Naruto, I enjoy the process of disecting what I don't like about it, though the things I do like are just as much there. The amount of pros and cons are balanced, whenever I see that happen I think \"average\" or \"mediocre\". Though there are moments of Naruto Shippuden that I think are good, or great even. It managed to execute several cathartic, gripping scenes. It's just that the \"dragged-out-ness\", the excessiveness ruins a lot of that.\n\nThough I did enjoy watching it, for all it's faults, I leave it with a"}, {"id": 2188, "score": 40, "body": "This anime is everything that makes a bad manga adaption, and a sub-par anime in general.  Let me start by saying that I am a fan of the manga and the 2011 anime, so I will be judging it on its faithfulness to the source material as well as its merits as a stand-alone product. This review will be most useful for people in my position, but I'm still keeping it spoiler free. I only made it 52 episodes into this 62 episode series, but if it somehow had a massive jump in quality in the last 10 episodes, that doesn't change the fact I was bored or aggravated out of my mind for the majority of the first 52. The first 30 were absolutely abysmal.\n\nEven when compared to other popular anime from the same decade (such as Yu Yu Hakusho from the same author), it not only aged poorly, it hardly stands to the competition for the vast majority of its run time. So let's start from the top.\n\nStory: 4/10\n\nHunter x Hunter spends roughly the first 30 episodes dragging its feet through the Hunter Exam arc and being as melodramatic as possible in what is supposed to be the most light-hearted of the series' arcs that is only meant to touch on the darker themes that come later. The first entire half of the show is a painful slog of poor pacing, bad filler episodes (and characters), and even some bizarrely out of character interactions. Just about everything Nippon Animation added to the series took away from it as a whole and muddled its core themes, and they added a lot.\n\nThe second arc, Heaven's Arena, fairs better in that it's not wholly aggravating to watch, but there are some bizarre cuts made that rob the reviewer of vital information needed to understand Nen and Hisoka's personality--I can't possibly understand their reasoning here. It seems like they were just trying to cut corners to avoid animating another fight scene. The order of events is also swapped around, and for the worst too, since it directly contradicts the narrative Gon and Killua's motivations for this arc.\n\nThe third arc, Yorkshin, is just as much of a melodramatic slog as the rest of the series, but it at least has the benefit of some narm charm, and at least it keeps the filler to a minimum. \n\nArt: 5/10\n\nLike many adapted anime from this decade, it's fairly inconsistent. There's a few exceptional art directors among the bunch, so the art can vary from awful to great. Although it does tighten up as the series progresses, with most of the worst animation being in the beginning, it's rarely ever stunning in its execution.\n\nOver all the color palette is very drab and desaturated, and all the character designs are realistically proportioned--which I don't think works to the series' benefit in the least. It loses the charm of the original manga's artwork, and it makes it look far older than it is. It completely loses its sense of bouncy pacing and energy which would contrast the darker themes that come later. It's mostly just boring to look at, and mediocre at best.\n\nSound: 1/10\n\nBesides the soundtrack, which is unmemorable since I can't remember a single track (the only exception being a couple fun OP and EDs), the sound effects are...horrible! They either didn't have the budget and resigned themselves to using entirely stock sound effects, or they only made a dozen or so themselves and just never bothered to improve. Maybe it was a combination of the two, either way the result is a mess of constantly unfitting sound effects that ruin any tension by being downright laughable. \n\nEverything sounds like stretching rubber. Everything. \n\nEvery animal sounds like a dinosaur roar. Every single one.\n\nAs I watched, it started to become a running joke. It was the only way to tolerate it. It wasn't until I saw how bad the sound design in this anime is that I could truly appreciate the importance of good sound design. If you took a shot every time they used rubber as a sound effect, you would die.\n\nCharacter: 6/10\n\nThere's a bit of characterization here that feels out of character, and it's all things Nippon Animation added. Most of the problems seem to fall on Kurapika and Leorio in the early arc, but other characters suffer here and there as well.\n\nOver all, Gon and Killua are still fun characters to watch when they're interacting on screen, and thankfully once the show gets into Heaven's Arena arc the characterization tightens up and begins to follow the manga more. Things get a little more light heartened, and we start to see what made the original manga captivate so many people.\n\nDespite that, a lot of the side-characters feel less memorable than they should, and a lot of content is cut from them and reallocated to anime-exclusive content. I will say that the Heaven's Arena girls they added were earnestly enjoyable and funny though.\n\nEnjoyment: 3/10\n\nThe first 30 episodes get a 2/10, it was absolutely unbearable. The rest that I've seen gets a 5/10 since it ranges from just tolerable to enjoyable. There's really no consistency.\n\nOverall: 4/10\n\nNo matter how decent the second half becomes, I can't forgive it for wasting nearly 720 minutes of my time. Maybe one day I'll watch the last 10 episodes and the OVAs, but despite Hunter x Hunter's 2011 adaption and the manga being among my favourites, and coming into this anime with an open mind and hoping to enjoy it, I simple couldn't.\n\nI don't recommend this series to anyone, really.

Like right away it begins with this crazy over the top battle between a wizard criminal and a SWAT team on a train that results in explosions, a whole train being turned upside down and then exploding while simultaneously crashing into buildings, and then even a helicopter is taken down (and then explodes!).\n\nThen after all this, the pair of human cop characters jumps onto the train, spits a cigarette at him, shoots him like 3+ times in the leg and boom, he's arrested. It's a short quick two minute action scene and at that point you're not questioning why wizard lawyers is a thing but wizard police isn't a thing.\n\nIt's after this you realize the show isn't the human cops having silly but fun over the top battles with magical criminals and then the wizard barristers do their thing in court. No, as a matter of fact, there's zero sense in the human police going after the wizard criminals at all. Following this realization, you're struck with a second one. That there is an actual serious main plot in a show about wizard lawyers in a __modern day setting__.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/8QqXG4P.png)\n\n\n___\n\n#Everything is Wrong#\n\n- __\"Characters\"__\n- __Magic + Imagination = CG Mechas???__\n- __The Horribly Executed Premise__\n- __Terrible Lawyers__\n\n___\n\n#\"Characters\"#\n\nAlmost all of Wizard Barristers' are or a combination of: cliche, boring, and generic.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/Jhzf6ql.png)\n\nOur main character is half-Canadian (they make sure you know you know she's Canadian repeatedly) Cecil Sudou. Sixteen years old, Cecil is the youngest person to become a wizard barrister (they also repeat this ad nauseum). A traumatic event that happened six years prior to the show which she has no recollection of resulted in her mother being put on death row after using magic to defend Cecil. Thus, to try and get her mother a retrial, she becomes a wizard barrister.\n\nThe only problem is she's not a very good one, Nor does she ever improve (she and the others at one point go to Boston for \"lawyer training\" but none of it is shown as it's just an excuse to get Cecil to go on a road trip back to Canada). But magic wise, because she's the main character, she literally cannot stop becoming capable of using new different types of magic. It's stated that wizards are only capable of using one type of magic, but Cecil ends up with three or four different sorts of magic. At one point, she literally just gains magic wings with absolutely no explanation because she's falling from the sky. Convenient.\n\nWhenever she's in a difficult spot, she just gains a new spell to get her out of it. It's lazy. Mind you, her starting magic is she can take metal from the area around her and literally create and pilot ___gigantic CG mechas.___\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/Fm2Hbgq.png)\n\nMoving on, there's Natsuna Hotaru who like Cecil, became a wizard barrister at the start of the show. For more than half the show, her entire purpose is to simply be rude to Cecil because Cecil is the main character so Cecil is actually doing cases immediately after becoming a wizard barrister. Should have just had \"THE RIVAL CHARACTER\" flashing in neon letters over her head every single time she was on screen. Except no, because that never really goes anywhere. In one of the later episodes, I guess they just decided enough was enough and put them together and then in one episode, Hotaru almost spontaneously becomes friendly towards Cecil after finally having a conversation with her rather than just throwing everything she says back at her over and over again.\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/PyElztM.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/MM3ovw9.png)\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/DPeEYHc.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/Afb16kp.png)~~~\n\n~~~_\"Even the pervert frog has gotten tired of your attitude.\"_~~~\n\nThere was the Law & Orderesque duo of cops which I had wished the show would have actually had been revolved around. But that would have been too silly and fun, human police busting magical criminals after crazy and over the top fights. Instead, they're supporting characters that have their own role to play in this show's main plot (yes, it has one). \n\nWho else was there? There was a blue haired guy wizard barrister who would yell at Cecil for using magic and thus getting fined for using magic. There's another female wizard barrister who seems weirdly obsessed with Cecil despite only recently meeting her. The female boss wizard barrister character was interesting in the fact that she'd go so far in bending the rules she'd let her ___entire office of wizard lawyers raid a gang base while rampantly using magic despite openly using magic being frowned upon or usually considered a crime___. There was another female wizard barrister whose entire dialogue revolved around guys. There's an old man wizard barrister who I thought nothing of at first but the episode starring him is hands down the closest this series has gotten to getting something resembling genuine enjoyment out of me.\n\nApart from the old man, literally the only other enjoyable (???) character is Cecil's familiar, whom is a perverted talking frog person named Nana Genie (that sure is a name I'd give a pink haired perverted talking frog sidekick). Really, I could not even begin to go into how amazingly deep this frog character is. I just can't do it. I can't do it.

None of the action scenes following that first one reach that level. It's crazy, but fun to watch. But after that, it's more or less mostly CG mechas created from magic battling each other. Even when it doesn't get to the level of mechas, the magical battles between the criminals and wizard barristers are hardly that fun to watch or interesting.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/qbHDsyw.png)\n\nThis show is supposed to be about magic. But the main form of magic most commonly used by characters is taking the metal from their surrounding areas to construct giant CG mechas. It just seemed like they didn't even try. Rather than even attempting to try and make their take on magic even slightly interesting or neat, they just ended up going with this instead.\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/JQORunv.jpg) img440(http://i.imgur.com/WCyLVt4.png)\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/EKiejGD.jpg) img440(http://i.imgur.com/05uGs3Y.jpg)\n~~~\n___\n\n#The Horribly Executed Premise#\n_And inconsistent tone_\n\nThere are two ways I could see the premise of wizard lawyers working well. \n\nOne, you could replace the modern setting with a fantasy setting and it'd be a serious show about the going ons in a magical courtroom in a world of magical beings and wizards and so on. \n\nTwo, keep the modern setting, but cast aside the seriousness of it, and it'd be about ordinary human police arresting out of control wizards. \"My neighbor wizard set my dog on fire\" and so forth.\n\nBoth options could be done in an entertaining way, surely. Wizard Barristers however unfortunately, was all over the place. It's a modern setting with perverted frog sidekicks, human police whom go after these supposedly super dangerous magic criminals with nothing more than a pistol and succeed in arresting them (and in the first two minutes of the show, no less), CG mecha battles, grudges and an uneasy relationship between the humans and wizards, and the occasional demonic summoning ritual.  \n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/NwcGom3.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/WKxOxO6.png)~~~\n\n_Not only does she not use the rocket launcher at any point, but she was the one chasing a magical criminal who upended a moving train despite having nothing but a pistol and a lit cigarette_ ___at the very start of the show.___\n\nDon't even get me started on the episode where they took on a hostage situation while dressed as magical heroes (???) or the \"Okay, let's go on a road trip to Canada\" episodes. You can either go for non-serious or serious. Trying for both will more than often end in disaster. Either focus on Cecil trying to help her mom and magical conspiracies or give the world the spin-off about a super team up between the pervert frog and hilarious old wizard barrister that we deserve.\n\n~~I would pay to watch that show. No hesitation.~~\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/J0b96Ez.png)\n\n___\n\n#Terrible Lawyers#\n\nThroughout the entire show, it is pounded into your head that in this world, using magic is not viewed as okay. If it's not done in self-defense or the defense of others, it is more often than not considered a very serious crime which may result in being put on death row. Wizard barristers aren't the police, their role is to defend or prosecute magical criminals in the courtroom.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/CdyTfmk.png)\n\n...Or not. These wizard barristers, if they're not getting into magical battles, they're using magic to get evidence they otherwise wouldn't have been able to obtain. The boss/head of the office isn't against it at all either. Hell, she essentially encourages the entire office to raid a gang base with almost everyone using their magic to obtain one of the gang members to use as a witness in a case. \n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/zITg6RT.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/kNAqe3V.png)~~~\n\nIt makes you wonder... if magic is so common in this world that just an ordinary bank employee can be a wizard, then why don't they have wizard police as well as wizard barristers if magical crime is such a problem? Apart from the first action scene, it's mostly the wizard barristers who end up being the ones battling most of these magical criminals anyways.\n\nAdditionally, more often than not, the courtroom ends up just being another site for magical battles to happen. In one case immediately following our wizard barristers successfully avoid their defendant ending up on death row, their defendant essentially confesses that not only did she kill someone with magic, but she had intended to do it out of revenge. Then the wizard barrister with Cecil breaks her restraints allowing her to go on a rampage intending to kill everyone present in the courtroom.\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/7fkMkcV.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/U4Iv1iy.png)~~~\n\nOne of the later cases (without going into spoilers), Cecil's side despite being the defense essentially act as the prosecutors and the prosecutors act as the defense. I believe it is mentioned that their office of wizard barristers only does defenses earlier in the show, but it's just so nonsensical... they could have just had Cecil's side be the actual prosecutors of the antagonist. It's not like the lawyer aspect of the show is the main thing or anything. It's perfectly fine for the courtroom parts of the show to be completely nonsensical and weird.\n\nThe old man lawyer outright uses magic to get evidence proving the innocence of his and Cecil's defendant, and outright fake collapses in the courtroom when the judge begins to ask him if he used magic to get this evidence. When this happened (I correctly and preemptively guessed that he was faking it), I underwent an uncontrollable fit of laughter. It's later stated by one of the other wizard barristers that he does this ___regularly___.\n\n_Right after coming out of the hospital, he just moonwalks away. Are you kidding me???_\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/2Za5dKB.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/YG5WRWc.png)\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/wWf8Hjr.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/JDnB3g8.png)\n~~~\n___\n\n#Conclusion#\n\nAm I still talking about this show? Good lord.\n\nThe plot while bad, dumb, and more than a bit jumbled, doesn't warrant its own section. Also, I can at least give them that at the very least, there IS a main plot (from beginning to end) unlike [some other bad shows](https://anilist.co/anime/20712/LanceNMasques). Additionally in comparison to everything else in the show, the plot didn't give me any major headaches apart from a few things that are more or less outright major spoilers. Considering various other aspects of this show I've already gone over, it's hard to make serious complaints about the plot. \"There's a dumb twist? Who cares, THERE'S LITERALLY A PERVERTED FROG PERSON AS A SIDEKICK.\"\n\nIt certainly isn't the worst thing I've watched. It's down there, though. A __1.5 out of 10__ or rather a __15 out of 100__. I of course don't recommend watching it (it's somewhere in that gray region between hilarious and annoying on the spectrum of bad shows, maybe a bit closer to annoying), however...\n\nIf at all possible, I'd recommend literally the first two minutes of the very first episode and the fifth episode (the elderly wizard barrister one). If I ever reach the point where I'm capable of compiling a list of most hilarious episodes from \"bad anime\", this old man is a strong contender for the number one spot.\n\nOh yeah, and this is a bit of spoilers I guess, but towards the end they had this gem of a death scene. [Really amazingly animated.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhmBnaEcbfA) I mean that's what you'd expect because after all, it's almost the climax of the show pretty much. They certainly wouldn't drop the ball there.\n\n~~~img500(http://i.imgur.com/skAXDz1.png)~~~"}, {"id": 2196, "score": 35, "body": "The ending of \"Nadia\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Secret of Blue Water\" provided a sense of closure to the story, and that is one of the many problems with this theatrical sequel: there is no reason for it to exist.  The consensus from many is that _Nadia\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Motion Picture_ is actually worse than the awful island/Africa episodes combined.  The movie isn't quite that bad, but this should not imply that it's of the same caliber as the series--on the contrary.  There are a lot of bizarre inconsistencies in the plot, which basically feels like a hastily cobbled Saturday morning cartoon episode, minus much of the depth and richness that made _Nadia_ as a series so appealing. The whole thing tries to be a funny, fast-paced sci-fi mystery adventure, and there are some laughs to be had--but it's hilarious for all the wrong reasons. The action sequences, in particular, are implausibly staged (one involves Jean and Nadia fighting bad-guys--he removes a grenade from his pocket... and destroys a group of enemies in one shot, yet he and Nadia escape unharmed!).  Even one-liners from the Grandis gang runs dry in places.\n\nRegrettably, the \"cartoonish\" aura is made even more apparent by the animation.  \"Sub-par\" doesn't even come close to describing how sloppy and unattractive it is.  Compared to even the Lincoln and floating island episodes (which were visually awful in comparison to the better eps), it simply looks dreadful.  The recycled footage that makes up the first thirty minutes (ironically the best part of the movie, except it's all poorly edited and sequenced in a way that will confuse all but those who are familiar with the series) only reinforces the dubious quality of the movie as a whole.  Actually, wasting the first thirty minutes with footage is a major mistake on the filmmakers' part:  it provides little to no time for whatever story there is to fully develop.\n\nWorse still, the new characters come across as cliche, cardboard cutouts.  The villain of the piece in particular, Dr. Giegar, a sort of mad scientist with a silly-looking hairdo, is laughable--it is suggested early on that he is worse than Gargoyle, but he turns out to be just the opposite.  He's nowhere nearly as frightening or fully-realized.  The central new character to the show is Fuzzy, a blonde (and not very talkative) girl who serves to reunite Jean and Nadia after two years of living apart, and unfortunately, she comes across as the dullest in the show.  Probably the only character to show any depth is her distant father, Dr. Whola, the sort of gruff man who at first rejects his daughter for being a carbon copy of the real thing who was killed (oh, surprise), only to realize his error.  But even then, there is something about him that feels very forgettable.\n\nRemember how most of the island episodes (and the Africa ones) seemed to press reset on most of the main characters and have them behave in over-exaggerated ways?  Well, this movie is guilty of doing the same--the biggest problem I have is why Grandis and her gang would go back to a life of crime... and even attack Jean!  Didn't they already establish a close relationship with the leads?  It's also baffling that the movie starts out with Jean and Nadia separated.  The pair had already confessed their feelings for each other by the end of the series, so why is Nadia trying to be an independent reporter in London?  And how in the world did Jean end up with an annoying parrot as a pet?  Well, at least when they become paired up, their relationship at least isn't as grotesquely warped as in the worst episodes, but it still feels hokey and weird.  It's even more surprising that Marie, King, Electra, and even Ayerton were written out of all this.  (There is a disclaimer that this happens before the events of the epilogue, but come on now!)\n\nOne thing that is fairly well done about the movie is the relationship between Nadia, Jean, and Fuzzy--not something I was expecting to say.  Unlike the Africa village episodes, which jammed in a useless and mean-spirited love triangle, this one is not as annoying--there is no issue about Fuzzy's age and Jean remains consistent.  In fact, there are two very cute romantic interludes between Jean and Nadia which at least provide some charm (one on a boat, and at the end).  And while the resolution of the triangle regarding Fuzzy did feel very much like a cop-out and lacked emotion, it at least wraps out inoffensively (albeit predictably).\n\nBelieve it or not, the other saving grace about the movie is the dub, provided by ADV's Monster Island studios. _Nadia_ has always been one of my favorite dubs to listen to, and it's a treat to hear the principal cast reprise their roles.  Rather amusingly, the script even works in a joke about Jean's French accent!  (And while it's still pretty shaky in this movie, I can't imagine Jean without it.)  The new characters are fairly well voiced too, particularly Eric Henshaw as Dr. Whola; they do their best with their cardboard cut characters and provide consistent energy and liveliness.\n\nAll in all, however, I will not be visiting _Nadia \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The Motion Picture_ again any time soon.  Wasting 30 minutes of recycled footage, as mentioned, was a bad idea, and it's even more disappointing that there wasn't much more thought put into the script.  The original creative staff also had nothing to do with this movie; it was simply made just to cash-in on the show.  As a matter of fact, you can just skip it and you won't miss much at all."}, {"id": 2198, "score": 0, "body": "_Fist of the North Star:  The Movie_ is simply awful.  The storyline is lacking in any coherency or nuance, the characters are all mono dimensional and uninteresting, and the presentation is turgid.\n\nTaking a 100-episode series and trying to squash it all into a two-hour movie (never a wise decision when adapting any such lengthy source material) may be part of the problem.  But the major issue with _Fist of the North Star:  The Movie_ is that it is, simply put, not at all interesting.  It's basically scene after scene of blood-splattering violence, with few breaks in the action, and a virtually nonexistent plot.  Characters come in and out at various times, over cluttering an already busy movie.  We are never given a specific reason to care about anybody in one way or another because of that.\n\nThe end result is a boring, and frankly, not very compelling train wreck that doesn't make any sense.  Apparently there are two different endings to this movie, but because the movie provides very little reason to care one way or another, it's hard to know __what__ could have made it any better.\n\nThe English dub, provided by Streamline Pictures, is even worse; a dreadfully wooden, robotic, stiff, and all around boring train wreck with disappointingly underwhelming turns from everyone involved, despite the presence of names like Michael McConnohie and Greg Snegoff. In fact, it gets my vote for being one of the worst dubs of all time. Carl Macek and company have done so much better.\n\nI've ripped into this movie long enough for you to get the idea.

That's the entire show. ~~10/10 show, go watch it now. Right now.~~\n\n~~~__---------REVISE ALL OF THIS---------__~~~\n\n___\n\n#Introduction...?#\n\n...I don't even know what that was. Everything just went blank for a couple of minutes. But okay, this is an adaptation of the [manga](https://anilist.co/manga/81415/Nobunagun) by [Masato Hisa](https://anilist.co/staff/117261/MasatoHisa), brought to us by the studio [Bridge](https://anilist.co/studio/397/Bridge). Nobunagun was for me, a show I expected absolutely very little from, but ended up being very surprised by. Not necessarily positively so. Then for some reason after watching the first episode, I watched the other twelve in one day. I don't really know why or how it happened.\n\nI really can't explain it. Just like how I can't explain why or how this came into existence at all. Thanks Masato Hisa, who also did [another series about a bipolar prostitute that kills undead having gained power from the semen of the men she sleeps with on a day to day basis](https://anilist.co/manga/86870/GratefulDead).\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/wyKiWfc.gif)\n\n___\n\n# ...What? #\n\nDescendants of Nobunaga Oda, Jack the Ripper, Isaac Newton, and Mahatma Gandhi fighting aliens. That's the show. I just can't get over that that's the whole premise. It just feels like it's so unabashed. Like you can't make that into a serious show, and I honestly think they didn't even try. Which is great because it would have been even worse if they had.\n\nI mean just what is up with those choices? Of all of the historical figures that could have been chosen to be thrown together as a team to fight aliens, Jack the Ripper??? With Gandhi??? Wh--why? I mean there's actually more characters who are descendants of more historical figures who are a part of this organization that their entire purpose is to battle these aliens that seem hellbent on destroying Earth.\n\nBut really, the ideal team we truly need if we wish to stop the alien menace is Nobunaga Oda, Isaac Newton, Gandhi, and Jack the Ripper.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/jnM7Cfi.png)\n\nBut not all aliens are bad. See, there's this one other alien guy who can actually talk, and basically he went around collecting the DNA of famed historical figures and then proceeded to go around implanting them in random family lines all over the world (?). This good alien did all of this because he knew in advance that one day, the bad aliens would come to Earth for crazy fun murder times.\n\nLook, it's perfectly logical and sensible. If an alien just wandered into a dark alley where Jack the Ripper was doing his thing, Jack the Ripper would then proceed to stab the ever living shit out of that alien for interrupting his murdering. Therefore, get his descendant on an alien fighting team and have them go _murder aliens_.\n\nOh, by the way. Jack the Ripper's true identity is ~!actually [Florence Nightingale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Nightingale). Look, even if you have a \"good reason\" (the show provides one) to murder prostitutes, MURDERING PROSTITUTES IS STILL... MURDERING PROSTITUTES. APOLOGIZE TO FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.!~\n\n___\n\n#They're perfectly fine representations of historical figures#\n\nThe show has some leeway to work with because it's mostly the descendants of these historical figures rather the historical figures themselves, but it's essentially implied they're supposed to be actual reincarnations. Like, our main character literally has dreams of Nobunaga's life before everything gets kicked off. But Nobunaga is basically shown to be this violent and murderous guy, and when his descendant \"awakens\", she summons this gigantic gun out of nowhere and starts murdering aliens despite previously being an ___ordinary (though somewhat odd) high school girl.___\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/Zlm5spu.jpg)\n\n_Behold! The descendant of Galileo Galilei (I GUESS)!_\n\nThe Isaac Newton girl is a bit too... promiscuous? There's a weird vibe coming from Gandhi in almost all non-action scenes ESPECIALLY when it's just him and Nobunagun. As for Jack the Ripper, he's nowhere as near violent or muderous as one expect but as previously stated in that spoiler there's a reason for it.\n\n~!___APOLOGIZE TO FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.___!~\n\n___\n\n#Conclusion#\n\nBeyond the absolute ridiculous premise and the very questionable takes on/representations of these historical figures, I don't think there's much more to say about this show. Like... plot? They eventually beat the aliens. That's it. SPOILERS! Yet, I still watched this show in the span of a day. Because a decent portion of it is enjoyably bad. Really, the true groan worthy stuff mainly (and unsurprisingly) comes from the non-action scenes.\n\nI honestly would recommend to watch Nobunagun as I think it's the worst show I've watched that I simultaneously still really enjoyed. It probably is second to only [Ranpo Kitan](https://anilist.co/anime/21189/RanpoKitanGameofLaplace), but that was more of a matter of wondering [what they were going to throw at me next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q81i3ZpAe6s).\n\nBad shows can still provide entertainment (although maybe not always the sort the creators intended), and [some](https://anilist.co/anime/20645/Glasslip) [just don't](https://anilist.co/anime/20712/LanceNMasques). I'd argue Nobunagun falls into the category of one that does.\n\nA __4.5 out of 10__ or __45 out of 100__, while acknowledging an even lower score would be justifiable (though I've watched worse shows that have also provided less entertainment).\n\n~~~img500(http://i.imgur.com/CUiaGcB.jpg)~~~"}, {"id": 2210, "score": 30, "body": "Ok to start the world itself is fun and the fact they follow their own law is nice to see. This has made the world feel more immersive as a whole. Though the way that characters refer to threats such as war is baffling as war doesn't actually exist and people can just choose not to play a game or fight if they don't want too with no actual consequence.\n \nThe characters themselves are best summed up through the 2 main heroes. Sora & Shiro are 2 people bent on world domination who constantly abuse the only moral character in the story.\nBoth fortunately and unfortunately all the characters are lacking in any form of depth.\nThe main moral character Stephanie is bullied then given small praise leaving her open to then bully her again (For what I assume is meant to be comedy).

However these victories are almost completely empty as they come from superpower like intellect given to them before the start of the show making them completely in every fight unbeatable. This goes so far as to give them the power to beat a god in episode 1.\n \nOverall the show is entertaining in parts and certainly unique however the comedy tries to make light & fun of abuse and the characters and story are completely hollow."}, {"id": 2215, "score": 10, "body": "~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/bYXf8IY.jpg)\n~~~\n\n~~~__Spoilers?

Glasslip is the show for you, then! Thank you, [Junji Nishimira](https://anilist.co/staff/101837/JunjiNishimura) (the director ~~to blame for this show~~)!\n\nI wonder what he's been doing since Glasslip--[oh...](https://anilist.co/anime/21197/Bakuon)\n\nGlasslip is an original show brought to us by the studio [P.A. Works](https://anilist.co/studio/132/PAWorks) whom also made [Another's anime](https://anilist.co/anime/11111/Another), another one I'm absolutely not that fond of. But they also did [Uchouten Kazoku](https://anilist.co/anime/17909/TheEccentricFamily) and [Shirobako](https://anilist.co/anime/20812/Shirobako) so... I guess the (incredibly) bad shows balance out with the really good ones they did.\n\nThis is about when I'd try to describe Glasslip, but I don't think I really have anything to add beyond what I started with. It's only after I've finished watching it that I actually wondered what genre Glasslip would even be considered. \n\nSlice of life? Technically true, I suppose. But I love slice of life, and there are plenty of slice of life series where stuff does happen and there are actual characters that are either entertaining or neat to watch as they undergo their everyday lives. In Glasslip, there's none of that. No interesting or entertaining characters (chickens don't count) and nothing happens. Absolutely. Nothing. Happens.\n\n_\"I'm sure people would want to watch unlikeable characters go on a hiking trip for an entire episode. I'm sure that's something they want. It's a sure thing.\"_\n\nI'd describe it more as a faux supernatural drama about teenage romance triangles (far worse than a mere triangle). Here's a group of unlikeable teenage characters with a deep and complicated web of romance (he likes her, she likes him, she likes him AND her and so forth) between them and also oh hey the main girl can see the future when she looks through glass __MAYBE__.\n\nAnyways... I'll... I'll try to cover at _the very least_ the main points before my brain erases all lasting traces of this show.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/NAqdVTH.jpg)\n\n___\n\n#Characters#\n\nimg500(http://i.imgur.com/Kx0UEfs.jpg)\n\nOkay, what do we even have to work with here?\n\nThe main character, Touko Fukami, is I guess the main character as out of this group of \"friends\", she gets the show's spotlight most of the time. She helps with her family in making glass and whenever the show isn't focusing on episode long hiking trips, teenage romance/drama, or Touko's \"ability\" to see into the future, it's her usually making glass. It's never really brought up in any major way or relevant to the actual story of the show beyond the fact she usually sees the \"future\" whenever she looks through glass.\n\nAlthough, it also happens when she's not even looking at glass so... why even try to establish that it's related to the glass in the first place? I mean I know glass is in the title but I don't really understand why it has to be glass.\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/jtQR87T.jpg)~~~\n~~~_The real life inspiration for Glasslip's best characters. Jonathan the Chicken not pictured._~~~ \n\nKakeru Okikura otherwise known as \"David\" (Touko refers to him as this once in like the first episode and the others keep calling him this later on despite after having learned his actual name), is unfortunately the main male character. He moves to the town and then for some reason strikes up a conversation about how Touko can see the future and if she leaves her chickens outside, roaming packs of wild feral cats will murder them. As an outsider to Touko's group, he mostly makes zero attempts or efforts to try and befriend the others. Actually, he seemingly purposely antagonize everyone other than Touko (whom he seriously believes can see the future for some reason). He speaks in cryptic nonsense, sleeps outside in the woods or sometimes in a tent (_for some reason_), and apparently sees copies of himself and holds actual conversations with them (___FOR SOME REASON___).\n\nWHILE ALSO HANGING OUT IN THE WOODS. No, it's fine. Touko's friends are the ones who overreacted, Kakeru is perfectly fine and well adjusted. IT'S FINE (especially since it's an actually recurring thing). Right in front of Touko, he at one point tries to have a running contest with the other guy who likes Touko, and whomever won would \"win Touko\"...? But he was actually not even going to run? I was kind of confused when the other characters actually treated him like he was insane after suggesting this and slapped him. I honestly thought they were going to go along with it.\n\nBecause after all, WHY DO THESE CHARACTERS DO ANY OF THESE THINGS THEY DO? IT'S INCOMPREHENSIBLE.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/1nq9d8J.jpg)\n\nSachi is absolutely the most infuriating of Touko's friends. She wears glasses, she reads books, and she's sickly. You could remove her entirely from the show and almost nothing would change. She's always either in the hospital or there are lines of dialogue being spoken about how she has to or should go to the hospital soon. She also confesses to her already current boyfriend and also Touko for some reason. I still don't really know what was up with that. It just happened so suddenly and then one minute later, we were back to future fragments, chickens, and David's mom playing the piano. Why have a character confess to two characters at once especially when there are __NO__ memorable interactions between that character and the second character she's confessing to prior to this (or future interactions for that matter). \n\nI honestly can't be asked to go in-depth about Sachi's boyfriend (that's his entire character) Hiro Shirosaki, or the step siblings Yukinari Imi and Yanagi Takayama. I just don't have the energy. Plus they were completely overshadowed by the other three, whom I hated or was constantly questioning their reasons for their actions.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/TLqfaKh.jpg)\n\n___\n\n#Everything is pain.#\n\nCharacter stuff aside (there's certainly more I could have brought up), there's a lot more things in Glasslip that just... bothered me. Yes, the most obvious complaint, the show is slow and never isn't slow because nothing worthwhile of any note happens. Even now really, one of the only things that immediately comes to mind is when Kakeru ended up getting assaulted by both of the step siblings duo. Partially because I had to stifle a cheer because not only did something happen, but Kakeru is infuriating every moment he is on the screen or talking.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/twOvvyO.gif)\n\nStill, despite how easy of a complaint it is, it definitely is worth noting that I don't think I've seen a show where even less happens than in Glasslip. But you also have to figure in Glasslip, they actually make an effort almost at the very end of the show to render all of the stuff they were establishing completely meaningless/pointless. Touko's mom outright says to her in the final episode something along the lines of: \"Oh by the way, do you happen to see weird things when you look at bright lights and stuff? I sort of thought those were visions of the future when I saw them when I was younger, but the truth is it was all bullshit and in my mind.\"\n\nI wish I was joking. They actually did that. I can't even imagine the audacity you'd have to have to pull that on the 13th and final episode of a show.\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/yRQ6wTQ.png)~~~ ~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/QmgoGIf.png)~~~ ~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/VGc9RS8.png)~~~ ~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/DFj36kV.png)~~~\n\nThe fact that the future fragments were in fact literally nothing wasn't a surprise at all. But my prediction was that both Kakeru as well as Touko in fact had some sort of mental disease or disorder. It's weird to just be talking with your friend one moment and then the next, you see a random swarm of mind birds just suddenly fly and swarm at you. \n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/xvFhSQY.png)~~~ ~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/5tnB4Iv.png)~~~ ~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/zTQa9Gc.png)~~~ ~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/r3zFWFt.png)~~~\n\nIt's not something that should have just been explained away in one line of dialogue by the mom. They... the whole seeing the future/supernatural stuff started in the very first episode!\n\n\"The show's over, and we didn't explain any of this. Oh well.\"\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/7ccWo7Q.png)~~~\n\n_~~~\"I'm sure the people who actually sat through all thirteen weeks of this when it was actually airing weren't curious at all.\"~~~_\n\nAs frustrating as a show or a series just suddenly retcons or explains away a whole earlier portion (or in this case, the entire thing), there's still actually more that needs to be mentioned.\n\nThe dialogue, holy hell. Most of it is just a lot of yawn-inducing nothing, but some of it is just... really awful. Unsurprisingly, a decent amount of it is sprouted right from Kakeru's mouth. The whole future fragments thing is just a whole bunch of nonsense in the end yet he speaks as if he's so assured that Touko can really see the future. But it is certainly not limited to only Kakeru. There is one specific moment in Glasslip that's burned into my brain because it caught me so off guard it caused me to react physically.\n\nAgonizingly Long and Insufferable Context Describing Actual Glasslip Scenes: So, in one episode following Kakeru goofing on the male of the step siblings duo, Yukinari is depressed. For even while he confessed to Touko, Touko continues to spend time with Kakeru who seems to do nothing but ramble cryptic nonsense and sleep outside in a tent. Therefore, Yukinari begins to start running every day to take his mind of it. The route he takes just happens to be along the window of the pool where Touko's sister and her friends swim at, and they ogle at Yukinari whenever he comes running by the building. But eventually, Yukinari just keeps on getting more and more depressed causing the girls concern for this COMPLETE STRANGER they're staring at. The way Yukinari looks prompts Touko's sister to run out of the building get on her bike, catch up to Yukinari, and then spout perhaps the most ridiculous line of Glasslip that's also come the closest to causing me to physically cringe at something out of an anime.\n\nShe yells at him, a probably genuinely depressed person (his knee was messed up due to an accident previously in his life or something yet he was still running every day), to \"stay attractive.\"\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/3IPGy66.png)~~~ ~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/T0lEPn5.png)~~~ ~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/gT68Pbj.png)~~~ ~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/bRxbPg7.png)~~~\n\n...Please don't try and treat this as some sort of deep and emotional moment. Of all of the possible ways you could came up with to basically get across \"please cheer up\", they ended up going with \"stay attractive.\" Then, later Yukinari's step-sister Yanagi approaches Kakeru and hits him with \"IT'S YOUR FAULT MY STEP-BROTHER ISN'T ATTRACTIVE ANYMORE.\" Both of these happen in the same exact episode, and it's just too much. Please stop.\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/U1Hq5s1.png)~~~ ~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/Y8bn1kk.png)~~~\n\nOh yeah, and episode twelve very hurriedly introduces a parallel world/alternate universe/imaginary world that is summoned/Touko is sent to because she listens to Kakeru's mother play the piano? Like basically everybody was opposite to what they were really like, and Touko and Kakeru's positions were flipped. Touko was the outsider who moved to the town, and Kakeru was in the group instead of her. Pretty weird, and I don't really see why they felt the need to introduce such a major thing so close to the end. Especially when it didn't add anything, and also in the immediate next episode Touko's mom would literally debunk all of the stuff Touko was seeing in her mind as... well, nothing.\n___\n\n#Chicken Metaphors#\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/JtWwLcH.jpg)~~~ ~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/IiLXAXF.png)~~~\n\nSaving the best for last, let's finally talk about the chickens and chicken metaphors. The chickens appear from the very first episode of Glasslip and throughout almost every single episode following. The chickens are in the op and the ed, Touko and her friends adopt the chickens in episode 1 only for them to later end up back at the school where they used to be, during more than a few conversations (especially between Touko and Kakeru), the camera will just switch to the chickens as they're talking repeatedly.\n\nOf the group of chickens, there is a chicken named Jonathan and in one episode, he is shown distancing himself/moving away from the other chickens. Is Jonathan the Chicken supposed to represent Kakeru, who is this loner sort of guy who keeps his distance from Touko's group of friends? Mind you, all except one and Touko herself basically overly hate. Hell, by the end of the show, he is physically struck by at least two of them.\n\nWhat if... what if in truth, they were chickens all along? Look at the first pictures again. There are five chickens, and there are five members of Touko's group including Touko herself. But there is also a hawk or an eagle in the sky. Is that Kakeru? After all, Touko's group only becomes unstable after Kakeru arrives, and the chickens are in fact running away.\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/yz9plmj.png)~~~ ~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/3IUwOVw.png)~~~\n\n_She asks the chicken if he's Kakeru for some reason, and then exclaims the same chicken isn't Jonathan. What???_\n\nWhat about the clouds? What are the clouds supposed to represent?\n\nThis may all sound like extensive hyperbole, but with a show of so much \"nothing\", it seems this made people more actively search for some sort of meaning. [Chicken metaphors.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2hfo2a/spoilers_glasslip_episode_13_final_discussion/ckses23/) Perhaps while born out of a desire to try and justify having watched the entire thing, it doesn't entirely sound too implausible. Especially if Junji Nishimira truly does have a history of... using chickens. But I haven't watched [True Tears]( https://anilist.co/anime/2129/TrueTears) so I can't verify that either way.\n\nYet as far as Glasslip goes, there's no way there isn't something going on with the chickens. I refuse to believe they would purposely include them as much as they did if their only purpose behind it was \"okay, there's chickens.\" It was pretty funny at the beginning but by the end, it was baffling that it was still happening/happening even more.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/0rLvG45.png)\n\nI think Touko was sitting on those stairs drawing the chickens at least two or three times. Does she just really like drawing chickens or does she want to ditch the glass making and try to be an ornithologist? \n\nPoint is, even though that explanation made me go \"oh, okay, I can kind of sort of see that\", it does not excuse this show for anything at all. If you want to try and make like this complex and deep plot with metaphors while also including all of this supernatural stuff about seeing the future... I don't know, maybe chicken metaphors isn't the best route.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/FpTTFeL.png)\n\nI'm just saying. I've never made a show, I've never animated, I've never written a script, I've never directed anything but... it feels like, I don't know, that they could have done better than this.\n\n___\n\n#Conclusion#\n\nA straight up and unhesitating __1 out of 10__. \n\nP.A. Works doesn't make bad looking shows (I mean come on, did you see those chickens? BEST CHICKEN ANIMATION HAND DOWN). If they had focused on one thing, Glasslip could have maybe turned out better. Make an actual teenage drama/romance series, a supernatural series where a glassmaker sees the future through the glass she makes, or just an outright calm and slow moving slice of life show that's actually about making glass. Don't shove all three together and then just slam chicken metaphors on top of it as hard as you possibly can.\n\n__\"WE NEED TEN MORE SHOTS OF THE CHICKENS. MORE OF THE CHICKENS, WE HAVE TO HAMMER THIS HOME. OUR ANIME HAS TO BECOME KNOWN AS THE ONE WITH THE CHICKENS.\"__\n\nWhile my attention did sort of perk up every single time the chickens came back, or like when they did the episode where it was just a hiking trip and then immediately with the next episode, it was back to the chickens, it's still not enough. Glasslip is very much a bad anime, and even worse than that, it falls far onto the worse side of \"bad anime.\" It's not hilariously absurd like Ranpo Kitan, it's not a ridiculously over the top and gory horror like Another... and even in something like Wizard Barristers or Lances n' Masques, at least things happened in those shows.\n\nIn Glasslip, nothing happens. What little that does happen, they make a point to essentially undo or deem pointless/meaningless. Therefore, really the only ways I could see recommending Glasslip is morbid curiosity, severe masochism, or if you actually like P.A. Works' other shows and have decided you're going to watch even the... less than stellar ones they did.\n\n~~For the record, out of the three, I'd argue Glasslip's Jonathan the Chicken would beat Wizard Barristers' perverted frog sidekick and Lance n' Masques' cute horse girl as far as \"bad anime\" mascots go. Everybody loves chickens.~~\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/OVpJpzG.jpg)~~~"}, {"id": 2219, "score": 15, "body": "~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/gKJpEYR.png)\n~~~\nONAs. They sure can vary in quality, can't they? \n\nAs a twenty minute long standalone episode thing, this review shouldn't end up being too long. ___Additionally, there's no way I can talk about it without essentially spoiling the whole thing.___ That being said, I still intend on being thorough, even if a small part of my brain is telling me well if the ONA is only twenty minutes, then surely this review should only take twenty minutes. _Or less._\n\n___\n\n# ~~Introduction~~ __The _Entire_ Review__#\n\nBut first, a tiny bit of background information about Luger Code 1951 just to give an idea of what it is. [This was a story idea/scenario that won an award](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-09-14/shonen-jump-animax-scenario-writing-award-winner-announced/.92907). I mean sure yeah okay, reward the guy with two million yen (an equivalent of $17,000), plus a [manga](https://anilist.co/manga/96668/LugerCode1951) (by the [Medaka Box guy](https://anilist.co/staff/103162/AkiraAkatsuki)) as well as anime adaptation. Described in that article, it doesn't sound terrible or anything.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/6g08xtX.png)\n\nHumans having a modern war with werewolves and the werewolves having some sort of military code that only werewolves can understand... like okay, that could be really silly/dumb, but it could still work if done right.\n\n...Was it done right though?\n\nThe characters are one note/very typical. There's the soldier/military type with Alex Rossa (he's the one with the hat), there's the non-military type/genius character with Testa Lielbelle who's the translator whose entire purpose there is to hopefully translate the Luger Code, and Yonaga. Yonaga is the captured werewolf girl who is the reason for Testa and Alex's appearance as a captured werewolf seems to be the key to translating the Luger Code. Which you know, makes sense. The code is made by werewolves, let's just go get a werewolf.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/hFCq8d8.png)\n\nHowever, Yonaga is openly hostile and she hates both the werewolves as well as humanity and doesn't care about the war, openly stating that they can both kill each other for all she cared. We really don't get to see much of a deep reason on either account. It's because of her \"cursed blood\" the werewolves hate her so she hates them back and as far as humans go well, to hell with humans, am I right?\n\nOkay, okay, but what about the action? _What about the action?_ The male werewolves when transformed look... uh...\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/ZfI33oI.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/XY4Pnm7.png)~~~\n\n...It's not like I want to be a heckler towards every single show I watch. But these werewolf forms do not look intimidating. Like okay yeah, if a gigantic muscular man with a dog face, a tail, and furry arms came charging at me in the darkness of night I would be genuinely terrified. BUT, I wouldn't be thinking \"oh no, I'm about to be mauled to death by an actual werewolf\" which is what these are supposed to be.\n\nAdditionally, the actual action itself is very... nothing stands out. The werewolf battle at the end was I guess supposed to be the climax and by that point I was just... it definitely didn't help. Despite this being only twenty minutes long, I was ready to be done. Which is not what your viewer should be feeling if you're doing action.\n\nOkay, the characters and action are underwhelming, but what about the story? Surely there has to be something good here. Or at least, that's what you wish to believe. See, the whole thing is that Testa and Alex are here to get this captured werewolf to solve the Luger Code. Or perhaps the truth is, despite being a supposed genius translator, he just turns to Alex eventually and says \"Well no, I've figured it was impossible the entire time.\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/JvbNEoy.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/JVItwwQ.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/8x79p0E.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/sGsc2y6.png)~~~\n\n...Don't you just love it when a show looks at you totally unashamed, smirks, and tells you everything was [actually a complete waste of time](https://anilist.co/anime/20645/Glasslip)? To be fair though, the Luger Code is literally just the werewolves recording and sending their howls?\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/OaulLG9.png)\n\nThis entire trip ends up utterly pointless and also disastrous for both Testa and Alex. Alex gets mauled by a rampaging werewolf man, and Yonaga shoots Testa to then turn him into one of the werewolf men to kill the other werewolf man. \n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/oy5Ubr4.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/fU8HQ2q.png)~~~\n\nHow does he kill the evil werewolf exactly? Oh, he just jams his silver cross into the werewolf after they battle. In the manga, he crushes his cross down into a makeshift silver bullet and fires it at the werewolf. Either way, the werewolf is killed via ___silver___. Hold on, these werewolves that humanity is in a terrible war with and Alex just absolutely could not kill earlier without his buddy becoming a werewolf himself, have the traditional werewolf fatal weakness of... silver.\n\n...Okay look, before humanity discovered that werewolves existed and promptly went to war with them, I'm sure the concept of a werewolf was still present somewhere in the mythologies and etc of this world. Why would they not immediately try silver on werewolves and why would they not be armed with silver bullets __after realizing their great effectiveness against WEREWOLVES???__\n\nI really do wish I was done at this point, but I do need to rag on Yonaga. I hated her absolutely and entirely. Because it was obvious what type of character she was going to be almost immediately from the start. \n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/kHG9xOJ.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/uU8WfxX.png)~~~\n\n\"Okay, Testa protected Yonaga from the other soldiers, this means Yonaga is gonna end up helping Testa and Alex against the werewolves despite previously expressing disdain for both sides of the war. She'll doubly need rescuing from the situation she causes when she howls summoning wolves to the cabin. Also from Testa, of course.\"\n\nEverything ended fine and dandy for Yonaga. She shot Testa point blank without even a hesitation and then changed him into a werewolf, costing him his humanity for the rest of his life. Wow, thanks Yonaga. It's a good thing Testa's fine with this. Maybe if it had been someone else, they wouldn't have been wholly willing to be eternal outcasts of both werewolves as well as humanity with you.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/4a3ddLt.png)\n\nWait, hold on. I somehow brushed over something monumental. When the cabin was on fire, Alex/Rossa just outright turns his head back to Testa when everyone's running for their lives for the door and tells Testa to just leave Yonaga. Excuse me? From the very start, retrieving the captive werewolf was the entire point. You can't just leave her to die in a burning cabin, THAT'S THE WHOLE MISSION ~~(even though it turns out getting her has no impact on the Luger Code anyways, Testa just can't solve it at all).~~\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/bm0L80x.png)\n\n___\n\n#Conclusion#\n\nTo summarize, I would say quite obviously, I thought very little of Luger Code 1951. It's astonishing to me that this actually spawned from a scenario that won a contest. But if this was the best to offer, I can only fathom the other sorts of entries in that contest. _Perhaps_ Luger Code 1951 simply won because it was the most outlandish idea of the bunch. Okay, humans are at an actual war with werewolves following WWII and a couple of humans are trying to decode the werewolves' military codes. Like I said, a werewolf war could have gotten either really silly or really entertaining, in a very silly and almost childish way.\n\n\"I want to see a war show. ___BUT WITH WEREWOLVES INSTEAD___.\"\n\nTo me, there's nothing wrong with that. Unfortunately Luger Code wasn't anything as entertaining as that could have been. Instead of the actual war between werewolves and humans, we get to see the attempt to decipher the werewolves' military code which ends up both fruitless as well as pointless and horrible for Alex and Testa. Alex gets mauled quite a bit and Testa gets shot and loses his humanity and has to wander around with Yonaga for forever.\n\nActually, I do find it worth noting that the manga version actually provided an ending where Alex actually somehow apparently deciphered the Luger Code somehow after he got back and his wounds healed, and he was apparently waiting for a message from Testa and Yonaga hoping that they were still out there somewhere. Well, what do you know? The manga actually has an actual ending. It's amazing what you can do if you even try a slight amount harder.\n\nStill, the manga is more or less about the same as the anime, and I give the anime a __1.5 out of 10__ or __15 out of 100__. But I think the overall moral of the story is clear.\n\nLuger Code 1951 won some guy two million yen/$17,000.

First, you can watch it as if it were a serious piece of media. Results here may vary. \n \nAlternatively, you can watch it as if it were a B-movie popcorn flick. Something to pass the time. Something mind-numbing and doltish, but self-aware enough to take all of its faults in stride and dive in headfirst and full-throttle. (Yes, I realise I inadvertently described Eren in a single sentence here).

Again, results here may vary.\n\n~~~webm(https://blog.sakugabooru.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/araki-battlefield.mp4)~~~\n\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the thing. As much as I wanted to commit to this second form of spectatorship, I found it near impossible to do so. Not that there was any shortage of overzealous overacting or indiscriminate plot twists. After all, these are what _Attack on Titan_ is built on. \n \nBut that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly it. I find there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only so much self-indulgent absurdity one can tolerate before such a formula gets dry. An entire first season was built on these foundations. Now, audiences are expected to salivate as the same formula is dished out before them. Not only this, one key ingredient seems to be missing: self-awareness. Much like the first season, except for the occasional moment, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little to no indication that _Attack on Titan 2_ isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t taking itself seriously. Which is fine. Only, if a show strives to present itself as a sincere piece of media, I find it difficult to avoid assessing it as such. \n \n#Damn, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ugly\n***\n \nFrom a visual standpoint, _Attack on Titan 2_ is mostly fine. Much like the first season, the art is probably not for everyone, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s non-offensive enough. Of course, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the idea: the drab colour scheme, combined with the fact that the titans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 designs (and hell, that of some of the characters too) are nestled firmly in the uncanny valley, creates that uneasy aesthetic that is so well-suited for and defines the _Attack on Titan_ series. However, the titans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 designs perfectly exemplify the earlier posited conundrum: they occasionally teeter into the realm of the stupidly comical. Again, this too contributes to that uneasy feeling: an unsettling amalgamation of innocent, mindless, childlike goofiness and devastating killer instinct. As such, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m more willing to forgive and even praise the show on this front. \n \nOf course, the art is [by no means flawless](https://twitter.com/DaLadybugMan/status/871068745858469888). The show also had a tendency to default to[ shoddy, CG horses](https://blog.sakugabooru.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/horseslide.mp4), and occasionally [titans too](https://blog.sakugabooru.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/go-back-to-your-bad-videogame.jpg). Likewise, there were more freeze frames than I cared for. \n \n~~~img480(https://blog.sakugabooru.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/attack-on-stilltan.jpg)~~~\n~~~_Freeze frames galore!_~~~\n \nThe highlights of the series are without a doubt, the intoxicating action sequences, especially those showcasing the 3DMG. Goddam, those gas effects! I cannot overstate how much skill and workpower likely went into their creation. The FX/animation departments at Wit seriously outdid themselves, and the outstanding sakuga was always something to look forward to. \n \n~~~webm(https://sakugabooru.com/data/f9a3d2f74cc6fc5e5ce5138001d7eb7f.mp4) ~~~\n \nOn a side note, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say I was the biggest fan of the change in scenery. The open fields and medieval-style buildings got boring quick, as there was not a lot to them as far as detail or colour was concerned. I guess there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only so much background art variety you can have when the show is literally set in a walled enclosure. \n \nThe OST is sublime. [Hiroyuki Sawano](https://anilist.co/staff/103509/HiroyukiSawano) continues to nicely establish himself as a leading musical face of the industry. Songs mainly consisted of a surprisingly effective blend of electronic music and orchestral choirs, plus the occasional insert song. These complemented the action scenes and emotional peaks well. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be lying if I said the OP didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t grow on me (although I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not entirely sure about that bit with the charging animals and dinosaurs and shit). The [ED is deliciously disturbing](https://files.catbox.moe/4kkaen.webm). \n\nwebm(https://files.catbox.moe/fw9cp3.webm) \n\n \nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult to assess the voice-acting, given that at any given moment, it is more likely to find a character yelling than not. Again, everything is hilariously overacted, from the voice-work to the character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s over-exaggerated facial expressions. Similarly, some of the shit that happens in the action sequences is so outlandish that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comical. Again, this wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be problem, except it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tension and immersion breaking. More importantly, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rarely any indication that this campiness is intentional. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little suggestion of self-parody. As such, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re laughing at it, not with it. \n \n#This is like all the things you can fit inside a memory\n***\n \nThis season has a slower, more character-oriented focus. Unfortunately, this points to the most glaring problem with the Attack on Titan franchise in general: it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s messy writing.\n \nFrom the opening episode of the first season, _Attack on Titan_ was brutally honest in how it was going to sell itself substantively: on cheap thrills. Initially, this hinged on the shock value (read: a ~~dingo~~ titan ate my baby) that arose from the admittedly brilliant (and unique) premise, but plot twists soon joined the picture. There is nothing wrong with this. It can certainly make some good entertainment. And going into season 2, you mostly get what you expect.\n \nwebm(https://sakugabooru.com/data/e87f4bd0fdfcd7bd14fd35950ed3ba36.mp4)\n \nPlot twists by themselves are innocuous enough, and I do commend the likely unprecedented manner in which the \u00e2\u0080\u0098big reveal\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of the season was handled. That said, they begin to lose their appeal when it becomes apparent that literally anyone and their uncle could be an enemy. Moreso, it becomes blindingly obvious this season just how (over)reliant _Attack on Titan_ is on these plot twists. Not just narratively: 'shit, the plot is at a standstill?' RKO outta nowhere. But also as a means of retaining the audience\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as if the show has gradually constructed a facade of mystery and intrigue, forcing the audience to pay attention lest they miss yet another, crucial, earthshaking plot development. \n \nThis is because virtually all other facets of the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s writing are lackluster. Take the inconsistent pacing. _Attack on Titan 2_ really does not know how to handle itself when there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lull in the action. I mean, we spend an entire episode sitting in a fucking tree. Very little progress is made this season. Sure, plenty of new discoveries are made, key plot points are raised, and a central villain is introduced. But resolutions are far and few between. More questions are given than answers. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as if as few manga chapters were spread across twelve episodes of anime as humanly possible. Multiple plot tangents concurrently exist at any given time and are tantalisingly drawn out. For example, the subplot concerning Connie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home village. ~!It becomes apparent what happened here in episode 3. And yet, the writers milk this plot point to the absolute threshold. It is not until episode 10 that the show reveals what the audience has already known for seven whole episodes.!~ Come. The. Fuck. On. Not only is this frustrating, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plain insulting. \n  \nThis irregular pacing can largely be attributed to the way character development was handled. Again, this season was more character-focused, where much of the secondary cast received some screentime. Of course, out of the central trio, only Armin receives any semblance of substantive growth. Despite the inroads made at the end of last season, Eren has reverted to his usual, headstrong self. Meanwhile, Mikasa remains as obsessively attached to Eren as ever.\n \nRather, we learn a bit more about ~~Connie~~ (yeah not really), Sasha, Hannes, Ymir, and Krista. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not exactly the most compelling stuff, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something, and I appreciate what was being attempted. It is genuinely touching to see these personal triumphs and advancements, given that these characters haven't had a lot going for them. That said, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not entirely sure what was going on with Ymir\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arc at the end here. ~!She had just come to the realisation, thanks to Historia, that she should \u00e2\u0080\u009cstop living for others\u00e2\u0080\u009d. And yet, she decides to run off with Berthold and Reiner, as for them to return empty-handed would be disastrous. In other words, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s subjecting herself to certain punishment for the sake of others?!~ This is mind-boggling. Seemingly, it can only be in service to something plot-related (likely in the form of a twist) later on in the series. \n\nwebm(https://sakugabooru.com/data/265e00360f9af83fb150f7f0f7accc97.mp4)\n \nRegardless, my biggest qualm with this new focus on characters is how overly-reliant the show is on flashbacks. In moderation, or when they form an intrinsic element of the narrative structure like in [_Hero_](https://letterboxd.com/film/hero-2002/) or [_Memento_](https://letterboxd.com/film/memento/), flashbacks are fine. But here, it is obvious that the writers (or [Hajime Isayama](https://anilist.co/staff/106705/HajimeIsayama)) were either too lazy or incapable of developing characters in a way that would smoothly integrate into and complement the principal, present-day plotline. Instead, they had to work retroactively, making up for lost ground by ostensibly giving the characters backstories ad hoc, so they could then have a platform to be \u00e2\u0080\u0098developed\u00e2\u0080\u0099 off of. As such, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so much receive \u00e2\u0080\u0098growth\u00e2\u0080\u0099, which implies progression from the character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moment of introduction, as we learn about the characters. Of course, the abundance of flashbacks chews up valuable screen-time that could otherwise be spent on more pressing concerns, like the main plot and subplots.\n \nNeedless to say, the subtext concerning humanity, preserving humanity, and questioning what even constitutes as human, is never really deftly handled enough to be too compelling. It's there, but only the surface is scratched, while the shoddy writing overshadows and detracts from these themes.\n \n#\u00e5\u00bf\u0083\u00e8\u0087\u0093\u00e3\u0082\u0092\u00e6\u008d\u00a7\u00e3\u0081\u0092\u00e3\u0082\u0088??\n***\n \n_Attack on Titan 2_, much like its predecessor, can certainly be good fun. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s action sequences are impressively animated and generally exhilarating to watch. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soundtrack is phenomenal. And whether intentional or not, it can always get me to chuckle.\n \nwebm(https://sakugabooru.com/data/a5515c88b10c098e4c3e066aa250eeb5.mp4)\n \nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unfortunate then, that it squanders nearly everything that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t action related. From pacing to character development, the writing does what it can to ruin the flow and intensity of the series. Of course, I chose to take the show seriously, and I undoubtedly would have enjoyed it more if I had approached it with a less sober eye. Then again, with very little indication that _Attack on Titan 2_ wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t taking itself seriously, I think it would be unwarranted if I were to do so.\n \n~~~<h2>Do I recommend _Attack on Titan 2_ ? \n__Depends.__ If you liked the first season, then sure.

The single and only joke I will be making throughout this entire review. It was a pretty good one in my opinion, but I feel as if I could have probably done better if I had tried. But I decided not to try because if these people making these shows didn't feel like trying, then why should I?\n\nNonetheless, a little thing before we start. Pupa has forced me to introduce a new concept to these reviews. Let me introduce the brand new staple of the TGG Review Series\u00e2\u0084\u00a2: The Pupa \"Please Let the Suffering Stop\" Alert Stamp\u00e2\u0084\u00a2.\n\n~~~img220(http://i.imgur.com/lXzGRf3.png)~~~\n\nPrepare to see this throughout the review. Whenever a train of thought goes a little too far or too deep down the rabbit hole or when the review just generally needs \"to stop\", this thing shall appear to hopefully curb the unpleasantness. After all, I wish for all of my reviews to be family friendly if nothing else.\n\n...It's too bad that one of this show's largest themes is inces\n\nimg220(http://i.imgur.com/lXzGRf3.png) img220(http://i.imgur.com/lXzGRf3.png) img220(http://i.imgur.com/lXzGRf3.png) \n\n___\n\n#Introduction#\n\nPupa is an anim--is a show--is a TV short adaptation of the [manga](https://anilist.co/manga/75613/Pupa). Some background information first. Apparently there was [hype for this](http://i.imgur.com/HYIom7B.png)? Really the only reasoning I can use to understand this is that people just weren't aware what Pupa was gonna be. I mean, if you only have the cover of the anime or the manga to go off of... or even just the description...\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/CjiXnNS.png)\n\nBut then it turned out to only be a TV short... then it was [delayed](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-11-15/pupa-anime-delayed-until-january)... then it aired and people realized oh holy shit it's [so bad](http://i.imgur.com/S4BBh4d.png). ___IT'S [SO BAD](http://i.imgur.com/gRHPNXu.png)___. \n\nBut just because a show has an overwhelming negative reputation doesn't mean you shouldn't watch it. Hey, what does everybody else know? Everybody has their own tastes and that's fine, and hey, maybe it's just an exaggeration.\n\n___\n\n#It's Not an Exaggeration#\n\nOkay, so let's very briefly put together of all of the flaws that really bother me in Pupa.\n\n1. __Episode six.__\n2. There is no plot. Things just happen.\n3. Trying to do entirely too much when the episodes are four minutes each.\n4. Horror is more than just gore. Please. PLE[A](https://anilist.co/anime/11111/Another)SE.\n5. Revealing the monster as soon as possible.\n6. The monster form eventually being replaced with the character in human form but with tentacles.\n7. Brother and sister relationships done the way Pupa does them.\n8. Cannibalism done the way Pupa does it.\n9. The whole point of the show is the cannibalistic incest and it's the worst part of the show.\n10. Final episode being a flashback episode when nothing about the plot is resolved at all.\n11. Unclear origins of the monster.\n12. Just outright dropping a huge plot thread and never returning to it.\n13. Horror cliches.\n\nWow, okay. That is a lot of things. How about a positive counterpart of that list? What are the things I liked in Pupa?\n\n1. The opening.\n\n...Yeah, that's about it. It's unfortunate that the only reason why that's a positive is I think having your theme or your opening actually say the name of your movie/show is just such a wonderfully cheesy thing to do. Of course, they probably didn't think it was cheesy themselves. But that honestly only makes it better.\n\n~~~youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqgT9W_3F3Y)~~~\n\nIn any case, I'll try to go over all of my negative points without making this review stupidly long. I might not get to all of them, but I want to get to the major ones.\n\n___\n\n#This happens, then this happens, and...#\n\nOkay, so the sister is walking home from school, she passes by a lady dressed entirely in black with a scarred (burned?) face who tells her to go home before she sees red butterflies. We see the sister's weirded out face for a second and then immediately, _there's red butterflies_.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/K7ONveh.jpg)\n\nAre you serious? The stranger in black JUST told you to not look at red butterflies. Obviously, the red butterflies are symbolism or some trigger that'll cause you to turn into a cannibalistic monster creature and--oh okay, that's a dog.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/Dxn7oSz.png)\n\nWell, it's not like the random stranger warned you about dogs. It was about butterflies, and the butterflies did nothing. So just go right up to that stray dog and pet it. What could possibly go wrong?\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/ga2v8vI.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/J71gOHX.png)~~~\n\n...The random dog exploded into tentacles that attacked the sister. Not ideal BUT--okay now the brother's here. Okay, now the sister just exploded into blood. Okay, now the sister has immediately become the monster and is already just cannibalizing the shit out of anything that's near her.\n\nOh GOOD.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/OBWoNpr.png)\n\n...This is the very first episode. Can you calm down a bit? Look, when the whole thing is \"there's a monster\" you should try and build up the monster. The worst possible thing you could have happen is the monster just showing up right out in the open and completely visible. This girl's entire transformation into this monster creature just happens as a result of her trying to walk home from school.\n\nIf this is not outright the most bizarre chain of events I've seen in an anime that's trying to be taken seriously (???), it's definitely up there.\n\n_A few episodes later._\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/t8Dh5jY.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/lL5b3gf.png)~~~\n\nOh my god no. Them being monsters aside, they're brother and sister, S T O P\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/53WYOqR.png)\n\n___\n\n#The Sister Was a Monster All Along? Child Abuse is the Real Monster? What???#\n\nWe see throughout the show that these siblings have not had a good life, what with an abusive father and all. The father is abusive to an almost ridiculous extent. Every single flashback we get of him is exclusively when he's being abusive. Like it's as if the only purpose this guy has in life is to go home and literally beat his kids for no reason.\n\nBut then. Then the show drops a bomb. The mother was even worse than the father. \n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/UByxRgp.jpg)\n\nLet's not even stay on this train of thought too long, because this section of the review is going to cause people's opinions of me to plummet down into the fucking gutters as it is, but. I will give the people who made this anime this much credit. This baby is one of the creepiest fucking babies I've ever seen in an anime/fiction/etc.\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/P2YeZv2.jpg) img440(http://i.imgur.com/1px4EBL.png)~~~\n\nThe entire episode about the siblings' mother is just downright bizarre. This might end up sounding strange, I know, but this episode is I think the one that actually got the closest to \"okay if this was done better, this could work as a downright creepy and psychological horror thing\".\n\nThe moment I saw the mother open that drawer. \n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/G6YlMtM.jpg)\n\nI thought... there's no way. There's no fucking way they're going to do this. And for a brief moment, the schlock horror fan part of my brain took over as I realized yes, they were absolutely going in this direction.\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/OBnFiUv.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/HPzHBUk.png)~~~\n\nAssuming the father was about as abusive to the mother as he was to their kids, we can sort of see that the mother is probably psychologically damaged. And a mother seeing her newborn daughter as some sort of inhuman monster and then proceeding to try and kill her, only for the baby to not only survive but then go chomp on an injured bird...\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/tuaPZ7z.jpg) img440(http://pa1.narvii.com/5769/7afb867978e9f2a412475813235fa0f96c44688c_hq.gif)~~~\n\n_~~~\"Wow, what a cute baby. Wait, why are you biting my face please stop--\"~~~_\n\n__That's completely fucked.__ But the beginning of the show is Yume being infected by the monster. We're never really given a clear answer as to whether the mother was right or it was all in her head.\n\nThe most bizarre thing about this episode about abuse and just general background information about how fucked up the relationship between these two siblings became is that this comes right before episode six. Episode six being where Pupa just outright drops the facade and just\n\n~~~img220(http://i.imgur.com/cNMgYdE.png) img220(http://i.imgur.com/cNMgYdE.png) img220(http://i.imgur.com/cNMgYdE.png)~~~\n\n___\n\n#Episode Six#\n\n\"That was a pretty fucking weird episode that came out of left field. Baby stuff in horror is a bit... cliche, but I certainly  didn't expect them to go full on attempted baby murder.

I will give you so much money to stop what is happening right now. This doesn't have to happen. We can go back to baby murder which actually could have sort of worked in a genuine horror way. There's no way they would just do an entire episode of this. Wait no shit, I said that about the baby murder too--\"\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/QeeWzi4.gif)\n\nimg500(http://i.imgur.com/ZlVotE7.png)\n\n___\n\n# ~~Escape~~ Conclusion#\n\nI'll never not heed the warnings of the Pupa \"Please Let the Suffering Stop\" Alert Stamp\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 ever again. They really did just do a complete [episode of nothing but the sister eating the flesh and drinking the blood of her brother](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPGn6zw2mdE). To an unforgivably graphic extent that is almost appalling. Then in a following episode, the brother basically states that he's apparently happy being eaten day after day by his monster cannibal sister.\n\n_I'm not a masochist. I just enjoy being eaten alive every day. What the fuck's the big deal._\n\nThis show isn't about abuse, it isn't a monster horror... it is a show about this incestuous cannibalistic relationship. Because even if the sister does briefly here and there kill people and show flashbacks of their fucked up parents, it always ends up going back to the familiar scene of the sister on top of her badly chomped on and bleeding to death brother. Like the whole point of the show is these scenes. Even basically the only conflict of the show is the sister rampaging against the government/a research group (???) who captures both of them so she can get her brother back so she can go back to eating him.\n\nEverything else is just salt into the wounds. The nonsensical plot, the continued besmirching of the horror genre, the cliches... like oh god... why butterflies? WHY BUTTERFLIES? A REALLY BAD AND GORY SHOW WITH BUTTERFLIES? [HAVEN'T SEEN THAT BEFORE](https://anilist.co/anime/21189/RanpoKitanGameofLaplace).\n\nIt's just... oh god. This show is a cacophony of misery.

ICLA almost exclusively makes only [fart](https://anilist.co/anime/19383/YamiShibai) and [horror](https://anilist.co/anime/21812/OnaraGorou) shorts.  I may have mixed those links up, but I honestly am not even going to fix it because it's probably about as accurate (I haven't watched their horror series about the fart being _yet_ so I can't confirm or deny that). Yami Shibai, what I've watched of it... the first two seasons and the first episode of season ___FIVE___, I feel it's a really hit or miss series to say the least.\n\nThus, I was surprised to find that Sekai no Yami Zukan was nothing but __HITS__. Literally every episode is a completely... like the drawings/art never remain consistent, it'll go from aliens to live action clowns to mermen at the drop of a hat, and like the narrator is speaking like they actually kept him completely oblivious of what the show was and told him he was narrating a horror series. If this is a genuine show that ICLA made and believed to be an actual effective (in any sense) horror, then that is _amazing_.\n\nFor this review, I'm honestly just going to go through every episode because I can't honestly believe that this is a thing that exists.  _Thanks ICLA._\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/49gMFRk.png)\n\n_Also, I'm calling bullshit. This genuinely cool looking guy made of insects appears NOWHERE beyond the credits. Why ICLA. Why do you do these things._\n\n___\n\n#Aliens, Snow Men, [Maximum Overdrive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_Overdrive)#\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/2gwkPfL.png)\n\nThe entire purpose of the first episode seems to me now after watching the rest of it to be:\n\n\"Yeah, this is what we promised. A horror show starring aliens and urban legends, so here's aliens. If you've literally seen any non-ET aliens ever in literally anything, then you've seen our aliens.\"\n\nI'm still addressing this episode however because it's comical that the husband's reaction to his wife leaving at night, wandering into a forest, and getting cut by branches as she stumbles forwards is that \"she's definitely going off to cheat on me.\" \n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/LmDQwGU.png)\n\nLike yeah, that's DEFINITELY a human. Idiot husband runs out to confront his brainwashed wife and is immediately abducted by aliens. At this point of the show, I believed this was just going to be a completely generic sibling to Yami Shibai. I was of course terribly wrong.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/ME8WcAi.png)\n\nEpisode two is where it starts to slowly creep up on you. _Something is amiss_. But this episode still meets what this show was supposed to be. Rather than __ALIENS__ they hit you with an urban legend. Yet... the father destroys the snowman at the very start so... am I supposed to believe that the yeti/murder bigfoot literally took the time to fix the snowman and then somehow wear it as a disguise to get the kid to go on a ~~murder~~ magical adventure with him?\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/Vuf7zaD.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/spjzDhC.png)~~~\n\nWait, can we just... take a moment and look at a comparison between episode one and episode two? Did like completely different people draw every episode or what? It's not like Yami Shibai is at all consistent, but at least the art remains mostly the same from episode to episode.\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/zSKRdHr.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/3rTCj4f.png)~~~\n\nAlso, even as he lay dying after being pushed off a cliff by an abominable snow creature that was in the middle of kidnapping his son, the father is still trying to scream out warnings to his idiot son who's about to be brutally murdered. Even though, EVEN THOUGH, his son was literally celebrating his impending death with his murderer. Michael, you little shit. You _deserved_ to be hugged to death by literally bigfoot probably (why do these reviews keep returning to [children dying or being murdered](https://anilist.co/review/anime/2224)? thanks horror [a](https://anilist.co/anime/11111/Another)nime).\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/1HV7iwd.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/TKVIIe6.png)~~~\n\n\"Aliens, murderous snowmen, what else do we got? We're not out of ideas yet! How about murderous trucks? Like an episode where a hitchhiker just gets into some passerby's truck, and then it turns out, WOAH. The truck literally eats humans... for FUEL TO KEEP DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD SO IT CAN KEEP EATING HUMANS FOR MORE FUEL.\"\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/HqY2YRN.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/GICx4zy.png)~~~\n\nOkay look. The lady being eaten by the truck still talking and repeating the same things over and over again even as the hitchhiker guy is losing his shit, is a bit better than generic alien or murder snowman. I give ICLA horror points for that, but I must immediately deduct them because the entire episode is mostly just of the truck coming down the road and when things start to go wrong, they simply use that same drawing again but zoom in and just throw the camera around. But it's clearly the same drawing when the guy was just talking to her, and not actually fearful for his life.\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/7JBqDjs.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/Tt2LjwQ.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/w6bbqkh.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/iEy8fAB.png)~~~\n\n___\n\n#Crop Circles, Robots, Sea Creature#\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/PmbKLHs.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/lTeznhQ.png)~~~\n\nCrop circles??? Excuse me, but we literally did aliens at the very beginning. You can't just go right back into aliens a few episodes later, that's bad form--\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/qO5yHLq.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/pJvBkj5.png)~~~\n\nOh wow, it WASN'T aliens. It was gigantic monstrous winged shining bugs. That's... kind of deflating. Okay sure yeah, bugs. Fine. But... why wouldn't they just eat the entire field? Why would they only eat enough to leave weird looking crop circles to suggest ___ALIENS___? Why wouldn't they kill the humans that interrupted their meal as well?\n\nI get that the whole thing is \"Crop circles aren't caused by ALIENS, but something ELSE. Like monstrous gigantic insects for example.\" but... ugh. Whatever, let's just keep going. It's too late to stop now.\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/7ZY76Vx.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/91j4Elb.png)~~~\n\nOkay, so a guy goes to a restaurant to get some dinner but for some reason the waiters aren't serving the customers. They're just standing there. Another customer literally punches one of them in frustration only to reveal, oh hell, the waiters and everyone else with obviously strange green skin are in fact ROBOTS.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/gJrXSQR.png)\n\nImmediately, we go right into the robot revolutions. Like ICLA has taken the gloves off entirely at this point and... an episode about a robot revolution? Sure, I didn't know what to expect from this before it started to air (although had an idea since it was ICLA) but this was definitely not it.\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/aOEHXJ9.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/sjYc0aU.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/S3iAh56.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/mc1GBD2.png)~~~\n\nThen... I can't believe this, but it turns out to be a twist ending and the father and leader of the human resistance was in fact one of the robots all along. There was of course absolutely no hints or anything of this prior to it happening... like this episode would have been the highlight of the entire show for me if what was approaching right around the corner hadn't been there.\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/HgXUCY0.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/JWOaBL7.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/xJfBJhk.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/UQIlx2K.png)~~~\n\nBut you see, there's actually a further layer to this stupid moronic twist ending. The human being a robot all along is just the surface layer. For you see, it's not that it was all just a dream, but in reality, a VIRTUAL REALITY SIMULATION. \n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/q100ffv.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/NLdbKmV.png)~~~\n\nDon't you understand? ROBOTS ARE GOING TO OVERTHROW HUMANITY SO THEY CAN... MAKE VR SIMULATIONS OF THEIR OVERTHROWAL OF HUMANITY FOR THEM TO RELIVE. ICLA is trying to warn us, and I believe we should take their warnings with the utmost seriousness. We have to abandon all technology and advantages of modern life and go and live in the woods otherwise, the robot revolution is coming.\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/V2mWS97.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/M8pkMVR.png)~~~\n\nThen there's an episode where some dumb young people decide to take pictures in front of a strange  beached whale monster. To... obviously bad results. One of the better episodes (as far as this show goes), but also one of the most boring ones. Sea monster with tentacles that eats people, GOT IT.\n\n...Let's just get to the clown already.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/162aopQ.png)\n\n___\n\n#The Motherfucking Spookiest Clown#\n\nI literally could not believe what was happening when I was watching this episode. Let's just take a brief second to take a gander at my raw reaction to it two months ago. That's right, _we're going meta on this one._\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/CUx9xc6.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/1wXWyUx.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/PvmEDcF.png)~~~\n\nI genuinely thought that they may have actually ran out of money, and that the rest of the episodes they were possibly going to do live action like this one. Thank God however this was not the case, and this was just a random and very strange hiccup placed in the middle of the show. It's almost brilliant really. People who decide to watch this later now that it's finished completely airing will make it to this episode and not even realize what the fuck just happened by the time they get to the next one, because with episode eight it's right back to the drawings like nothing even happened.\n\nBut oh it did happen. Boy did it ever happen.\n\nEven now, I honestly wonder if this episode was ICLA just straight up parodying themselves because this episode is outright a Yami Shibai episode but with all of the extra stuff just ripped away. There is a creepy thing lurking about, and it is getting closer and closer to the character/s, and it ends with the creepy thing doing a jumpscare/catching the victim/s.\n\nPerhaps I truly do just have a very bad habit of wanting to give people the benefit of the doubt, but I really do want to believe they knew what they were doing the moment they had one of their interns get into that clown outfit and put that rainbow afro on. Clowns are not exactly new to the horror genre. Like even putting Stephen King aside, there was after all [that real life guy who dressed as a clown and brutally killed people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wayne_Gacy). I mean we are [literally living in times where the monsters and serial killers of yesteryear cannot even roam about in the darkness of the night without fear of coming face to face with CLOWNS.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_clown_sightings)\n\nOn the ever growing list of my \"favorite bad anime episodes\", this is probably a STRONG contender for the number one spot... I'm biased though because of being a horror fan, but this episode broke me and sent me into a fit of laughter. Like, the entire episode, there's this horrible and infuriating clown laughter put over it, and when the clown gets out of the mirror and invades the house of the sisters', THE SISTER IS JUST STANDING THERE AS THE CLOWN JUST WALTZES RIGHT THROUGH HER HOUSE.\n\nOkay, if a clown were to invade your home through mirror magic, would you just let him wander throughout and possibly assault your sister? Everything about this episode is unfathomable. We're not even done yet.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/chWnYCA.png)\n\n___\n\n#Can't Take Anymore#\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/SoceJRR.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/W4DpNzJ.png)~~~\n\nTribals? Okay, what could they possibly do that's more insane or dumb than what we've already covered? We have to be approaching... like, there can't be even more.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/qNNKWOR.png)\n\nYet again, they use only one drawing for multiple scenes, zooming the camera in and moving it around when needed. The guy and the tribal kid initially arriving at the village, the guy discovering one of his dead friends, and the other tribals meeting the guy (aka the single arrow by his foot). I don't know why this bothered me as much as it did/stayed as clearly in my mind as it did, but... like they don't cut this many corners with Yami Shibai. They know. They know that Yami Shibai is their money train and this is just some weird experimental shit they just threw out there because why not.\n\nThey can't have thought this was... acceptable as... even like a Yami Shibai. I just can't believe that. They had to have known.\n\nI'm not even going to bother comment on how the blond white guy is named \"John\" and the tribal kid is named \"Jose\".\n\nWhoops, I got sidetracked. What happened?\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/5REKuTc.png)\n\n...Yeah, I'd like to know that as well. What the literal fuck transpired?\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/w7e0mWh.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/knT0kRs.png)\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/3F65hgN.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/b0FrSYq.png)~~~\n\n...What?\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/4MSuHGa.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/zuNP1gE.png)~~~\n\nSo, what you're telling me is that there is a tribe somewhere in the Amazon that either has a shrink ray or actual magic and is shrinking down other people and then eating them and forcing them to fight off germs and bacteria within their bodies which then makes them... well not immortal, but abnormally healthy. Is... is that what you're trying to throw down at me right now?\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/f2CflhN.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/RXwoSQL.png)~~~\n\nThere is... there is so much wrong with this. You would need so many more people because the couple of guys we got to see obviously had to be in only one tribal and... there is... like three or four shrunk down people are not going to be able to fight off an entire body's bacteria and disea--\n\nWhat the fuck am I even... this is all complete nonsense, WHY AM I EVEN BOTHERI\n\n~~~img440(https://33.media.tumblr.com/75cf6d6891c5a5e7a0366feaa32b8bd9/tumblr_npuq7h9aLS1uu8wcao1_500.gif)~~~\n\n___\n\n#Conclusion#\n\nI was genuinely going to do the rest of the episodes, but I covered most if not all of the really insane ones. Like beyond the point where I stopped, there was an episode about a box. Not just a box, but a supernatural box that makes people who look at it do horrible things. Then there were tree people who abducted children and turned them into fellow trees?\n\nIn good conscience, I am forced to give this show a __3.5 out of 10__ or __35 out of 100__ because I cannot give this a score lower than what I gave to Yami Shibai when this honestly gave me more genuine entertainment than Yami Shibai even if it is... painfully worse than Yami Shibai. If... if that makes any sense at all.\n\nWith Yami Shibai, I knew what I was gonna get every episode after the first couple. With Sekai no Yami Zukan I... fucking had no idea of anything... and... just god damn.\n\nEventually, my memories of this show are going to fade and slim down to basically nothing but the live action clown. I know it's going to happen. But following when these memories fade, let this review be a record of my statement that this is probably overall the most pathetic failure of a horror anime I've ever seen--well... \n\nIt's probably at least in the top five. This was absolutely terrible. But I'd take a season two of this over an inevitable Yami Shibai 6.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/zrI5t0q.gif)~~~"}, {"id": 2261, "score": 30, "body": "\"Well, Nanbaka sure was... a show.

The people who had escaped or just never got on in the first place were off watching better shows. Good shows. But I was here. Watching Nanbaka. Watching this supposed action comedy fucking devolve further and further into a slush pile of meaty bits and broken dreams. The only thing it had going for it was the bizarre and ridiculous and frankly ugly overdose of color but with season two, they decided that enough was enough, and took the color away and left us in darkness.\"\n\nimg440(https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bbAqX9QjURM/hq720.jpg)\n\n\"Where did the comedy go? Why did the focus shift almost entirely on just meaningless melodrama that is completely... like you started at zero, but now you're at negative one. Was the melodrama supposed to be entertaining? Was the plot supposed to be super interesting and be taken seriously?

There was no need to get weird or bust out the caps lock. People watch what they feel like watching at the time. If a person feels like they want to put their time into watching Nanbaka over shows like I don't know, [ACCA](https://anilist.co/anime/21823/ACCA13kuKansatsuka) or [Rakugo season two](https://anilist.co/anime/21733/ShouwaGenrokuRakugoShinjuuSukerokuFutatabihen), then that's their choice.\n\n...Unfortunately though, I _was_ that person. Thus, we're here. _Whoops!_\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/TH8phLc.jpg)\n\nAnyhow, there was in fact a [manga](https://anilist.co/manga/86693/Nanbaka) of this before there was an anime of this, by [Shou Futamata](https://anilist.co/staff/119487/ShouFutamata), who is most commonly known as the creator of such series as: [Nanbaka](https://anilist.co/manga/86693/Nanbaka), and __[more](http://i.imgur.com/KxKN5QM.png)!__ Before we get started, I feel it's worth mentioning that not only is this review going to be a shorter one, but also...\n\nRather than generally going on about how Nanbaka is, I'll instead be focusing on the actual surprising plunge in quality comparing season 1 to season 2 _(hence why I'm doing a review of the second season)_. I'll of course still address general flaws of Nanbaka as a whole here and there, but don't expect a section dedicated solely to how awful just the character designs are.\n\n___\n\n#Nanbaka Does Obnoxiousness Best#\n\nActually maybe awful isn't the word I'd truly use here, but absolutely fucking __OBNOXIOUS__. \n\nimg440(http://wallpapersin4k.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Nanbaka-Wallpapers-1.jpg)\n\nAlmost every character has multi-colored hair, colored fingernails, and apart from a few instances where this is not the case, THE ENTIRE FUCKING PRISON __SPARKLES__. It's too much. \n\nIT'S TOO MUCH. There is such a thing as \"too colorful\" and oh boy. Nanbaka literally... when one of the characters is going through an emotional arc of __SUPER SERIOUS EMOTIONS OF SADNESS__, the main way they demonstrate this is THE CHARACTER LOSES ALL COLOR.\n\nIf you do not have multicolored hair then you are in fact SAD. ___SAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD.___ THAT IS HOW YOU DEMONSTRATE SADNESS IN A CHARACTER, OBVIOUSLY.\n\n___\n\n#Okay, now I'm talking about the characters apparently#\n\nAlso literally almost all the characters are idiots _(did you notice that baka is literally in the title of the anime wow)_, annoying, or cross dressers. \n\nimg440(https://68.media.tumblr.com/9e126114a2ed21e575993ea4f0f99dcc/tumblr_inline_oephsd2YR81tuolij_540.jpg)\n\nThere is literally a ninja character who as a child was such a terrible ninja that he was exiled from his ninja village, and then some director abducted/adopted him and taught him the art of acting and he became a movie star and did solely ninja movies. Then ended up in prison after having an identity crisis??? \n\n_\"I was a ninja before, but I was adopted/abducted and then groomed to become a ninja actor. MY NINJA HERITAGE HAS BEEN BESMIRCHED.\"_\n\nLiterally in season one, there's like a whole episode, maybe more, dedicated to this ridiculous ninja character. But by the time he showed up again in season two, I had basically forgotten who he even was until he started doing ninja things and was like _oh right_.\n\nLike okay, I'll dial it back to the main character quartet. \n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/y7ngMfW.jpg)\n\nGreen Hair likes anime and manga, has to take medicine because all of the drugs he's been forced to consume over the years, for some reason has the ability to copy any and all abilities he witnesses other people doing if he's not on his medicine including ___qi kamehamehas___, and also apparently if he doesn't take another sort of medicine, his personality changes into that of a brutally violent psychopath.\n\nThen you have Purple and Red Hair who is strong and likes food. His... his character is so centered around food that his friendship to Black and Red Hair started solely because he busted Purple and Red Hair out of another prison before they ended up in Nanbaka (oh yeah, that's also the name of the actual prison, I didn't say that before) and treated him to hamburgers.\n\nThere's Purple and Yellow Hair whose character was... was... like I remember it being he's a gambler or he's really good at card games, but like they ran out of things for him to do, so they just had him be really annoying and also one of the main generators of the melodrama that sped up this show's decline into the dumpster. Here is a example of his dialogue.\n\n\"Black and Red Hair, no! You cannot escape from the prison! We four are all friends and we need to stay in the prison together!!! For if we were to escape we could obviously not continue to be friends because reasons we have to stay in the prison the entire show is about the prison we have to stay __THERE IS NO ESCAPE FROM [THE NANBAKA EXPRESS](http://i.imgur.com/auJB9wx.png)__.\" _~Actual Nanbaka dialogue probably, citations are to follow this review in proper academic format._\n\nFinally, there's our main character. Black and Red Hair. He can literally undo any lock ever. The only  reason they haven't escaped Idiot Prison is because Bald Guard beats them down every time (because bald character in an action show = the absolute strongest. [didn't you read the memo???](https://anilist.co/anime/21087/OnePunchMan)) and also because they love Idiot Prison. Also he has shackles on his legs and arms that turns his limbs into blades because he is an edgy and super serious action character who was experimented on in a previous prison by evil people. He IS the character who loses all color because he becomes sad for a while.\n\n...\n\n...What was the main point of this review again?????????\n\n___\n\n#__back to the main point__#\n\nI'm not even going to go into the plot because honestly, why would I? But basically, in season one, like for a whole chunk of episodes, after a bit of random comedy episodes, Idiot Prison just starts having like an action tournament or something? There's no point in pointing out the idiocy of having like a generic action tournament in a prison and then being surprised when one prisoner starts a ruckus, then another just suddenly sprouts blades for limbs, requiring Bald Guard to literally beat him bloody.\n\nBut you know, that still allows Nanbaka to do its thing. Dumb action comedy with colors. Sure it gets goofy when it tries to be serious but eh. But then, in season two, inexplicably... almost the entire season takes place underground in nondescript identical dark hallways. Suddenly, the sparkles are gone, and most of the episodes are in these fucking gray dark hallways. Because what makes action entertaining to watch? It being in a generic hallway.\n\nimg440(https://www.watchcartoononline.io/thumbs/nanbaka-season-2-episode-8-english-subbed.jpg)\n\nThe stupid tournament of season one at least had the benefit of eventually devolving into chaos and only lasting a couple of episodes. Season two, it's just them having melodramatic moments or fights in these goddamned hallways. So I say fuck it, and take a look at the manga. And what do you know.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/5FqmG4R.png)\n\nThe hallways are there. Oh good. Well, at least the studio remained faithful to the manga. \n\nI _love_ that the majority of the entire second season took place in these hallways. I _love_ that the literal ending of season two was them just escaping the underground hallways and saying _oh thank god that's over_. I _love_ that nothing was resolved and there's probably going to be a Nanbaka 3. I _love_ time being spent on one of the minor characters that was introduced in the tournament arc taking time to create melodrama by saying he doesn't like the look on Black and Red Hair's face and that he's useless despite being able to unlock any lock in a __PRISON__.\n\nimg440(https://www.samehadaku.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Nanbaka-Season-2-Episode-12-Subtitle-Indonesia.jpg)\n\n___\n\n#Conclusion??? __Please??__#\n\n...I really don't want for there to be a Nanbaka 3. The manga can keep on existing for a billion more years, a billion chapters of Nanbaka. After all, I'll never ever ever __EVER__ read the manga. But if the Nanbaka Express itself gets started up again, I'll be yanked along with it for another season of mediocrity and no doubt even __MORE__ pointless and annoying melodrama accompanied with generic and not terribly exciting action/fight scenes.\n\nThis review was all over the place, but I need to restate that season 2 of Nanbaka really is actually worse than the first season. Like I actually lowered my rating of the first season after the second season because it made me so grumpy towards the series as a whole. But even then, it's not like the original score I had it set as was great as it is.\n\nNanbaka 2, I give a __3 out of 10__. \n\nPersonal opinion of whether you should even bother watching it at all is... there are just so many better shows. Like even if you want dumb action comedy, there are so many better shows. Recommendation goes out to fellow masochists only. Like even if you want a [\"bad show\"](http://i.imgur.com/waDuCPM.png) to watch, there are [so many better terrible shows that are actually interesting in how garbage they are](http://i.imgur.com/gtFyMCD.png).\n\n~~~img500(http://i.imgur.com/SdkO5ls.png)~~~"}, {"id": 2262, "score": 38, "body": "Asked a simple question: Did I like this series? I'd say yes it was pretty good. Mild and sweet, just like a millet with too much honey. There was to little bitter in this supposingly bitter-sweet show.

And not a single one of them stepped out of the scheme. \n\nAfter that the art style comes - it's just like the whole production; mild. I did enjoy the opening and ending though. But when it comes to animation and looks - bang, here you are yawning again. Another shot - boom, too slow pace, and you are asleep.\n\nThere was even a character who was even more boring than the _Tsundere duo_ : the second male character (Kunimitsu Shidou but I had to check it). Why he was even there? The answer is: only for a gag (he thinks that Masamune is gay - HAHAHAHA! Hilarious)\n\nWelp, maybe the main character who made up his mind about what girl he loves - in a bizzare way but still. He was kind of manly - so it's not a typical MC in this kind of anime. \n\nWhat kind of show is it then? \n\nThis kind of show that you watch and it doesn't stare at you back. Anime that won't change you. That won't be remebered. \n\nI'd say - a show that barely exist."}, {"id": 2273, "score": 40, "body": "This is by far the most boring anime I have watched. I rarely finish a series if I find myself disliking it mid-way through the series.

The opening song is one of them. I enjoy it so much that I barely skipped it. I'd even go far as to say that it was the most enjoyable thing in the anime. The visual aspect of the opening was mediocre and just plain boring. The other thing that I enjoyed, or at least tried to, is the main character, Rin. Rin seemed to be the protagonist that I was always looking for in anime, which is why I badly wanted Mnemosyne to be good. She was the perfect mix of cool and bad ass and I really did like her character design,  but eventually, she just failed to be interesting.\n\nThe biggest problem I have with this anime is the lack of development. Everything from the plot to the characters was left unexplained. They fail to show what the main characters motivations are. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just exclusive to the main characters, it goes for every character in this anime.\n\nThe fight scenes are just meh. The show barely has any entertaining fight choreography and opts for guns and explosions. The most interesting fight scene in Mnemosyne is in the first episode and gets worse as the shows progress. In fact, the previous sentence describes the entire anime perfectly as the animation and stories descend far below pathetic by the last episode. The soundtrack is completely lackluster and seems to have been pulled straight from stock soundtrack library. \n\nOverall, I think it was mainly a waste of time.

Kakegurui is one of those shows.\n \n__Story and Characters__\n \nWell come to Hyakkao Academy, the land of insane teenage gambling, horrendous abuses of power and blatantly criminal acts of bodily harm. The school is supposed to be a place for the children of the filthy rich, but most definitely the filthy, where the future elite of Japan is meant to be prepared for a future where they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d lead the business of their families. In this institution, gambling is not simply a pass-time students can engage for their own enjoyment, but a core part of the social-structure of the school. Since the current student council president took over, she instituted a system where students who stack too much debt become \u00e2\u0080\u009ccattle\u00e2\u0080\u009d, considered second class among their classmates and have to remain subservient to the students with more money. Obviously, they also become primary target for bullying. For the viewer who shares that pesky desire to have the elements in the story making sense, this plot point will immediately raise a number of eyebrows, so let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s go bit by bit.\n \nFirst, how is this system even allowed existing? None of the students here are of legal age, so they should never be allowed to gamble outrageous amounts of money from their parents net worth. Is this a version or Japan where legal restrictions for underage gambling don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist? If that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the case, what about the restrictions for underage driving, drinking and sex? None of these are even mentioned, so I suppose the gambling premise is entirely based on \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think about it, bro\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Now, you might at this point throw at me my previous statement about realism vs. verisimilitude, but let make it clear: that goes for simple stuff, like my tsunderes being a bit more violent than what the real world would tolerate or children being a bit more mature than normal, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t apply for a universe where an entire legal system seems to operate backwards.\n \nFollowing the fact that the existence of this scenario is a contradiction in itself, why would anyone enroll their children in a school like this one? These students are supposed to be future business leaders, people with enormous responsibilities in their hands, so a cast system that allows them to be bullied, humiliated and sometimes even physically harmed by their classmates goes completely opposite to the goal their education is supposed to provide, that of shaping them into capable, resolute and strong-willed adults. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure any parent would allow their children to frequent a place like this if such practices are not only allowed, but incentivized. Then there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the money issue: the students make their bets with money from their families, which means that they are stocking up on massive debts their parents will have to pay. At long-term, this set up would make the cost of such education extremely expensive, making this school a lot more trouble than is worth. The list of absurdities doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop there, but let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s get to know the cast before we can dive head first into more nonsense!\nJabami Yumeko is the main culprit of the story. She generally keeps a playful and polite demeanor, but shifts to intense obsession when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to gamble. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pretty sure she is supposed to be a sociopath! Not a realistic depiction of a sociopath, though, but what fiction believes a sociopath to be like. Truth be told, Yumeko is no more than a Mary Sue. It may seem like a stretch to claim this, since general misconception is that this kind of character is also supposed to be virtuous (or at least framed as such by the narrative, even when the audience can clearly see that the opposite is truth), but she does have the basic traits of a Mary Sue:  she clearly has complete disregard for how much money she bets, the supply of money or her disposal is not even hinted at in the anime, so in how much danger she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s is unclear, at no point displays any signs of being the least bit worried, constantly displaying the face of someone who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always on top, even though her behavior is so needlessly risky. Ironically, at one point she even drops this gem: \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo realize one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ambitions, risks must be taken\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Funny, since she seems to have no ambition besides having a gambling playground for herself.\n \nBesides being nice to the already shitty-characters from the main cast and keeping a constant sweety-kitty-diabetes fa\u00c3\u00a7ade when not gambling, is there any reason for Yumeko to be seem as an actual force for good in this narrative? When it comes to motivations and general personality, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no less psychotic, abusive, deceiving, manipulative and sadistic than the members of the student council (or any other scumbag in this school), so what are the guaranties that once her main source of entertainment in the school is gone, or at least significantly diminished, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bring any positive change to the status quo? And even if she does, do any of these characters actually deserve it? They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all simplistic, poorly realized figures and most often just despicable people, despite the laughable attempts from the show on making them sympathetic by introducing last minute backstory.\n \nSuzui Ryouta, the closest friend to Yumeko, is an inconsistent pussy. He strangely seems to have no problem talking to multiple attractive girls at school, but from the first moment Yumeko enters the scene, becomes strangely flustered when first interacting with her. Besides that, his role is essentially to tell the audience how risky her situation is when she makes a crazy bet and to be mesmerized when she pulls off a victory out of some strategy the audience has no knowledge off.\n \nMomobami Kirari is the student council president, or Seitokaichou in Japanese, responsible for the creation of the cast system in place in Hyakkao Academy. She sees her fellow schoolmates as pets she can control and play with, as well as manipulate to gain power, although the goals she wants to achieve with such power are not explained in the story. Through an outrageous ass-pull in episode 11 (not a Deus ex Machina, stop using this term wrong) she proves to also be willing to backstab her own fellow student council members, which leads me to question how would anyone ever trust and help this bitch again, when she can betray them on a whim.\n \nOther members of the student council that matter are:\n \n-          Ikishima Midari, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s completely insane for life-threatening thrills and CARRIES A GUN TO THE SCHOOL! Seriously, how is this ever allowed? Why would anyone accept be put into a school that looks more like an asylum for demented shitbags?\n-          Yomozuki Runa, the loli dressed in a bunny hoodie who helps Seitokaichou on her schemes, gleefully plotting against the other members;\n-          Kaede Manyuda, the treasurer of the student council, very ambitious and arrogant, quick to dismiss the students he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t consider worthy enough of battling him. By all accounts, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the least awful creature in the cast;\n-          Sumeragi Itsuki, another crazy bitch, who likes to collect nails from other students, which she rips off whenever they lose to her in gamble;\n\nSo, besides allowing its students to be bullied and made into servants, potentially putting them in emotional distress that can severely affect their learning, this schools also allows bodily harm to be inflicted on them, as well as bets that involve possible death. Not crazy enough for you? The institution is also equipped with special sealed rooms, for when Ikishima feels the need to \u00e2\u0080\u009carrest other students\u00e2\u0080\u009d for her games. Let me spell this out again: this crazy cunt KIDNAPS people and locks them into special cells where she can bet on deadly games with them, using a FIREARM! Do you see why this setting is so hard to buy into?\n \nAs soon as Yumeko arrives at the institution, her one and only goal is to gamble with every strong opponent she can find, climbing the ladder until she can get the opportunity to challenge Seitokaichou, so the bulk of the narrative is focused on the multiple games she engages in with other members, occasionally crushing their spirit by revealing the manner they cheat, before beating them. Not always successful, though, as early on she manages to lose a serious bet, although it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s implied that was only possible through cheating, and becomes a pet. Interestingly enough, as soon as a previously successful character suddenly becomes a pet, it seems their winning record is instantly forgotten by the scumbag token extras, who immediately shift to bully mode. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re like me and has near zero suspension of disbelief for stories where everyone is an asshole, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have a hard time with this one.\n \nAs Yumeko uses her status as a pet to attract and challenge other student council members, she finally reaches the top members, challenging first Manyuda and ultimately the president. This is the point where the anime turns simply from rage-inducing bad to morally bankrupt filth! Through a seriously logically questionable trick played with the help of Sumeragi, who has an old grudge with Manyuda, they lead him into betting such a high amount of money, that the loss of that game would put him indefinitely subservient to the student council president and destroy his influence in the council, as well as potentially compromising his future and relationship with his father. Yes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that serious! So, of course, he loses and the defeat is followed by Yumeko and Sumeragi gleefully explaining how they manage to reach their ridiculously contrived victory, with the final blow being delivered by the president, by telling him \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re fired\u00e2\u0080\u009d, making him snap and pass out. In the follow up, Yumeko and Sumeragi discuss what just happens and the way their dialogue is frame tries to imply they had the moral high-ground, somehow. That last bit, to me, is the most infuriating part.\n \nSeriously, what exactly was Manyuda\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crime that was apparently so much more despicable in relation to the other students? Seitokaichou introduced a cast system that locks students into the role of cattle, where they remain subservient and bullied by other students, Sumeragi, who now we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supposed to root for, used to rip people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nails off, which basically amounts to torture, and Midari makes bets with people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lives; Am I really supposed to believe that this guy is so much more deserving of having his livelihood and future sadistically crushed because he underestimates his fellow students? When did arrogance become the worst of crimes? I call this idea bullshit and this anime a hypocritical piece of toxic waste.\n \nBy the way, the ending is a complete cop-out too.\n \n__Presentation__\n \nSo, do you like variety of facial expression for your characters to help flesh them out as credible, or at least likeable human beings? Tough luck, baby, here it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ahegao up the ass for you!\n \nFor those not aware of what I mean, \u00e2\u0080\u009cahegao\u00e2\u0080\u009d is the term in Japanese for the orgasm face, which despite the definition is not relegated exclusively for porn, but also used in comedic fashion to convey when the character goes through emotional ecstasy. You might have noticed by now that Kakegurui is quite the fan of quantity over quality, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll sure run that trope into the ground whenever it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s needed to convey that the fuck-sticks it passes for humans in the story are going through anything that might be classified as excitement. IT\u00e2\u0080\u0099L ALL THE BLOODY TIME! Whenever someone pull off some maneuver to outsmart or cheat their opponent in a gamble or even when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s simply to explain the \u00e2\u0080\u009cgenius\u00e2\u0080\u009d plan, they will pull off insane orgasm faces and laugh like maniacs. Of course, the biggest offender here has to be Yumeko, because someone up in Valhalla hates me.\n \nWhen it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not ahegao, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contorted maniacal expressions every antagonist feels the need to break into when they feel superior and about to win on a game, or when they try to be threatening. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite laughable, actually, when bunny-loli tries to pull one of these off, as if the show seriously thinks she is in any way the slightest bit scary. Seriously, any of the girls in the main cast can break her in half and this attempt from the show is just pathetic! Characters seem to break into such expressions almost to the same degree as the ahegao, as if to painfully remind you to not ever expect anyone here to have personality any deeper than a spit puddle, and that subtlety died and we buried its corpse when we allowed this disgrace to be written, published and animated. Along with the stupid story, the presentation here is another big problem for the anime, due exactly to the habits just mentioned.\n \nIs the voice acting of any help? Not really, although not as egregious as the horrendous faces, no character really demands anything more than two different modes of acting, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing to write home either.\n \n__Personal Ramblings__\n \nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to thank my dear kitten Nana, who in the last 3 months patiently endured my screams of agony and, even when hungry, waited for me to regain consciousness after bashing my head against the wall. It genuinely felt like this anime was specifically crafted with the perfect combination of traits that can make my blood boil. From the sickening emphasis on the disgusting faces, to Yumeko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s insufferable \u00e2\u0080\u009ckind and innocent girl\u00e2\u0080\u009d demeanor, along with the inconsistent, impossible to buy into setting and the fact everyone here is a douchebag, this whole show was intensively infuriating to watch.\n \nI swear, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not really that hard of a person to please, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enjoy a story where characters are also morally bankrupt or just outright evil. I mean, two of my favorites are Shiki and Black Lagoon, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think you can say the main characters in those shows are safely good people, what I ask is simply that the show frames that exactly as it is, not as if the horrible people on screen are supposed to be likeable or admired in any way. I am fascinated and genuinely find likability in well written morally ambiguous or evil characters, and I admire characters who display the responsibility and strength of morals I wish I had in my personality, but when the moral center of your story is a selfish, manipulative sociopath who can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be trusted to have anyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well-being in mind, I say you got your priorities kind of backwards!\n \nNow, if you excuse me, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll look for something trashy to wash away this memory."}, {"id": 2301, "score": 30, "body": "~~~img440(http://pm1.narvii.com/6449/d733e52484b99fae1abfcc8ecb1a16be897e766a_hq.jpg)~~~\n\n[Yami Shibai](https://anilist.co/anime/19383/YamishibaiJapaneseGhostStories) is my favorite horror anime.

Yeah, Yami Shibai 5 isn't scary at all. I don't know why you would have thought I'd say it was.\n\n...\n\nBUT WHEN YAMI SHIBAI 6 STARTS AIRING?

WE'LL GET A BILLION HITS AS I FAKE SCREAM INTO A CAMERA WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY JUMPING OFF OF THE ROOF OF MY HOUSE IN AN ATTEMPT TO SPONTANEOUSLY GROW WINGS AND FLY TO ANOTHER PLANET_.\n___\n\n#Introduction (an overview of Yami Shibai as a whole)#\n\n_Ahem_, sorry about that. The truth is apart from Yami Shibai 5, I've only watched Yami Shibai 1 and 2. I've done like one episode of 3, but that was about when 5 started airing and I figured there'd be no harm in just jumping on that instead. The announcement of Yami Shibai 5 came not too long after Sekai no Yami Zukan finished airing which I also reviewed and... I was curious to see what a new Yami Shibai could do after witnessing that _horror_.\n\nHonestly just thought it'd be another clear and cut Yami Shibai season. But there were some surprises they had tucked away ~!that reminded me of the feelings I had when I watched Sekai no Yami Zukan.!~ Which are the sole reason why I'm actually bothering reviewing this. If the entire season had just been... there is a ghost or monster, and ghost or monster pops up at the end to spook the viewer, I could wrap my head around Yami Shibai a lot easier. Because that I can at least understand. It's personally not my thing and while I think a jumpscare is absolutely not effective if from the get go you're going in EXPECTING IT, that [one series of movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranormal_Activity) do in fact exist and they made literally millions and millions of dollars.\n\nBut before we go into Yami Shibai 5, I went over 1-4 and made a little guide thing. Because at the time of writing this so far, it feels like they've done the \"ghost/creepy girl\" thing an intolerable amount of times just in 5 alone. So I said hey, what would the basic ideas of all of the episodes of all four prior seasons look like if put in a list thing? Would we actually be able to see the decline of imagination in a visual form?\n\n~!img440(https://i.imgur.com/hwIuEvr.png)!~\n\nIt's a bit long, hence the spoiler. Admittedly, for 3 and 4, I straight up just looked at the episode summaries on Wikipedia. So take those with maybe a grain of salt. Anyhow, the way I'm gonna review Yami Shibai 5 is just tackling it episode by episode like with Sekai no Yami Zukan but instead of just marveling at ICLA's insanity, I'm going to go into the problems and faults of each episode since Yami Shibai is slightly easier to take seriously compared to Sekai no Yami Zukan.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/9Z7dRl6.png)\n\n...OR MAYBE NOT. WHERE DID I PUT MY MULTICOLORED RAINBOW AFRO, IT'S GONNA BE ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE REVIEWS, I GUESS. THANKS ICLAAAAAAAAA.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/rHHJEHP.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/Bvg6xPg.png)~~~\n\n___\n\n#Domestic Distress, Random Creepy Girl, Friendly Old Lady#\n\nI'm a bit biased here since I haven't even watched the majority of season three and four, but I really found the first episode of season five disappointing, and perhaps a sign of the things to come. Like I just can't help but think back to the first episode of season two and think man, that was a pretty solid opening episode for Yami Shibai. Like a puppet was getting possessed by a kid that died in a traffic accident and this officer who was just doing a normal puppet show is freaking the fuck out and the kids in the audience don't know a thing.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/SapGdLV.png)\n\nWith season five it's just... a wife finds her son and husband (BUT ESPECIALLY THAT BRAT, HE WON'T EVEN PICK UP HIS TOYS _HOW DARE HE_) annoying, and then she gets a phone call. I can't help but mention that every single time the *mysterious person* calls, it's the same exact drawing of the mom holding the phone. To be fair, they were a lot worse with this in Sekai no Yami Zukan but... just... why not at least change the position of her face (her expression at least changes in two of the calls I guess)? Just because she answers the phone multiple times doesn't mean you HAVE to use the same exact drawing...\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/PN5AV1f.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/xkBYPhv.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/xkBYPhv.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/JPs7Bxe.png)~~~\n\nThen, finally, the ghost woman (it's a ghost woman by the way) just shows up at the door, the mom grabs a knife, and as hands are coming at her, it goes to black. Fade to black endings are my favorite type of ending. Don't get to see the actual ghost, don't get to see the mom try and stab a ghost... don't get to see anything.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/iUMYDLi.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/E9zqWTX.png)~~~\n\nThe \"fade to black before a spooky thing happens\" thing is probably a Yami Shibai staple (_I'm too lazy to go back and see how many episodes in the original two seasons end this way but I know at least more than a handful do_), but I hate it all the same.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/UnX6ULu.png)\n\nWeirdly enough, the second episode is probably one of my favorite episodes of this Yami Shibai season. The idea ~!(giving a ghost bits and pieces of your personality until it outright wishes to replace you entirely)!~ I thought was neat and could have worked if fleshed out (but since every episode is only three minutes long...), and the voice acting for the little girl was appropriate. Starts out mildy annoying (JO DAI, JO DAI, JO DAI) and then appropriately shifts into hammy creepy little girl voice. But they kind of messed up the landing with... like the reveal would have worked better if the little girl's face hadn't been...\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/ZgzPpYM.png)\n\nI mean I appreciate that they didn't over to the top with it and have her face be all demonic and shit, but could have made it... a little spooky looking, I guess. Additionally, perhaps I just like this episode as much as I do because it doesn't end immediately with the reveal. Her hands slowly come out from the side around her boyfriend and you think it's gonna end, but nope, now her face is also slowly coming out from the side. Didn't scare me, but I do remember thinking genuinely: _\"Okay yeah, this episode wasn't a complete flatline.\"_\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/keiLakb.png)\n\nAlso, don't want to mention it, but all the times she talks to the little girl, it's basically the same exact...\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/O88tyVI.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/1Ey7IiX.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/4IWMbp4.png)~~~\n\nThen, the third episode gets a little weird because while it follows the theme of the last two episodes in the sense that's there's just a weird creepy old lady...\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/gxUW54V.png)\n\n...But, this episode's intention kind of gets muddled. The creepy old lady doesn't get the daughter as the mother finds her in time right before the creepy old lady takes her, and then... they just leave, and the creepy old lady just waves at them. Oh... then, the old lady really wasn't a monster and trying to take the daughter? Wow, that's surprising.\n\n...But then, the daughter looks up at the tree where a bunch of crows are.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/05YFYzM.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/z4QakTL.png)~~~\n\n...Oh, the crows are... spirits of lost children. But wait, if the crows are in fact lost children souls who have been taken by the old lady, then that means the old lady is in fact bad. It's not like the daughter had been lost for more than a few hours, and the old lady sure did seem intent on taking her until right when the mom showed up. Also, why would the daughter willingly want to join the crow children if they're children who get lost and then get spirited away to become crows?\n\nIt feels like they wanted to do a thing about lost children while still wanting to do the Yami Shibai thing and making the creepy old lady be a monster. It doesn't... you can't do both. You have to pick one.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/wZGf4sg.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/RWz9Ayf.png)~~~\n\nI mean don't get me wrong. I like that they're trying around with different things, but trying to get messages across in a Yami Shibai episode... I don't know, sure there wasn't a jumpscare or whatever, but wasn't scared or creeped out at all. The children on the tree were just... goofy looking which should not be a thing that could be said considering they're supposed to be dead/spirit children. \n\nLike the entire episode is they see a creepy old lady, the daughter gets separated from the mother, the mother finds her, and then they leave. A Yami Shibai filler episode? Tell me it ain't so.\n___\n\n#Copycat, Shadow Women, Dial-a-Curse#\n\nI can't imagine that a viewer who's actually stuck with Yami Shibai all five seasons straight through wouldn't actually just start trying to predict what happens in the episode. Because that's basically what I started doing. With the fourth episode, I was close but no cigar.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/lcDeHrD.png)\n\nTwo college students that are friendly with each other, and one basically follows the other one around everywhere and copies everything she does exactly. Immediately, I form the prediction that the copycat girl is a ghost which was a bit silly of me, because the second episode already did the sort of \"ghost wanting to copy or imitate the living\" thing.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/Q98uKbM.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/2RCpcVH.png)~~~ \n\nNo, it turns out I guessed wrong on out of the two characters of which one is the ghost. It turns out that the copycat girl only made it into the college her friend wanted to go to because she died and therefore created a new spot, but then the copycat girl just finishes off her copying the way she died.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/pYI56Rr.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/ikyYdMI.png)~~~\n\nBut it also treats the copycat like the creepy character which... like if the ghost girl genuinely wanted to stop the copycat girl from copying her exactly then why didn't she just say \"please don't walk out into the street when the sign is clearly don't walk\" and also she smiles when copycat girl dies so... the twist is pretty muddled at this point, and I can't even tell who's the good one and who's the bad one anymore. And that's not exactly a good thing because sure the copycat girl could have just been acting insane because she's talking to the ghost of her friend who recently died, but why does the ghost smile when her friend dies despite the fact she was trying to get her to not copy her to the grave???\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/9AR9rwR.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/QBmZXog.png)~~~\n\nNext episode's just an incredibly distrustful wife believes her husband is unfaithful, and then it's just a bunch of shadow women are clinging to him. She then proceeds to get converted to a shadow woman as well, and the episode ends. \n\nTypical clear cut Yami Shibai episode with no twist or moral quandaries. Creepy women are creepy, _we get it, we understand horror._\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/4VFdOxL.png)\n\nSixth episode is about a girl who's all torn up because she lost her boyfriend to her friend or whatever and then she just happens to read a book saying that if you dial a number into a phone exactly at midnight, you can make a ghost or something return your boyfriend to you. But if you don't call back the following night, something bad will happen to you. \n\nHow this episode fails is... she does this, her friend dies (of course) and her boyfriend returns to her, and then she's supposed to forget about calling back. That's the way it's supposed to go. Instead, she remembers, and then returns to the phone booth in time to make the call BUT there's her friend's ghost using the phone already which prevents her from using the phone in time. Then it cuts to black and gore sounds, and then it shows the bloodied phonebooth.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/W5JCvJ7.png)\n\nI suppose the implication here is that her friend's ghost used the phone and dialed the number for the curse to happen to her friend, but there's one major problem here. ~~Apart from the goddamned cut to black ending happening, AGAIN.~~\n\n___GHOSTS CAN'T USE TELEPHONES, ICLA.___\n\n_Wait... the entire first episode of this season was a ghost using the teleph_\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/WfvNAUu.png)\n___\n\n#Hide and Seek _and_ Creepy Women Apartment#\n\nThe hide and seek episode (we're onto episode seven) was a fine Yami Shibai episode for the most part, there's a spooky and decrepit house, and a bunch of kids decide to go play hide and seek in the house. Then there's a (albeit random) monster who joins the game of hide and seek. The monster's arm comes in and grabs the straw doll resembling a boy, and a moment of uneasy silence before the monster opens the door again to grab the real child.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/LKCzjc0.png)\n\nThe problem is why did the parents just forget entirely about their child? They go to visit grandma's with their son, then leave without their son. And... the grandmother seemed kind of aware of what was going on with the house and also didn't forget about her grandson? Why wasn't she more prudent in helping prevent her grandson's demise?\n\n_\"Why are you nitpicking the plot of Yami Shibai episodes? You're supposed to just watch for the spooks and the scares and the AAAAAAAAAAA I'm scared!'s.\"_\n\nThen why do they have plot at all?\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/FbQ34A2.png)\n\nEpisode eight, and perhaps more or less a bunch of the later episodes of Yami Shibai 5 are where it gets fun. Or at least weird. Like watching Yami Shibai, I've always wondered, WHERE are all these creepy or ghost women coming from? There just seem to be so many in the Yami Shibaiverse. Episode eight is when we finally get the lore. See, there are so many of them in this universe, that there are entire apartments for ghost women to live and hang from the ceiling to periodically drop down and jump scare in.\n\nIt's great! I can't believe ICLA has finally upped their lore game and finally showed us where all the ghost women go when they're not scaring or murdering people!\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/C2yR5Ji.png)\n\n___\n\n# \"My friend just taught me how to see ghosts.\" #\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/RWFlKGh.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/r4mmEMo.png)~~~\n\nHere we go, the episode that caused this review. Just like how the live action clown episode of Sekai no Yami Zukan suckerpunched me and caused me to temporarily be unable to breathe because I was laughing so hard out of disbelief, ICLA yet again caught me completely offguard partway through one of their shows.\n\nOkay, we start with two college students and one of them turns to the other and tells her that she can see ghosts because her friend taught her how and she can teach her present friend how to see ghosts as well. She tells her friend to look into her eyes and oh no, there's a white blobbish CG ghost.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/IWihADf.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/ZYoBMCA.png)~~~\n\nNow since her friend has seen a ghost reflected in her friend's eyes, she herself will now see ghosts as well. But literally two seconds after teaching her friend to see ghosts, she realizes that after her past friend taught HER how to see ghosts, she never saw her again and immediately puts two and two together for a result of five. \n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/3L88LKQ.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/WoNDgSc.png)~~~\n\nDespite the immediate horror dawning on her face, the friend she just taught how to see ghosts leaves for a seminar plainly ignoring her friend's pleas not to leave her alone.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/m3700fU.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/W2DeQvY.png)~~~\n\n~~This episode is a farce. This episode is a farce. This episode is a farce. This episode is a farce. This episode is a farce.~~\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/uiIGGO3.png)\n\nThen she immediately goes and talks to two of her other friends and the ghosts come up in conversation and she says to HER two friends: \"Hey, look into my eyes. Do you see ghosts?\"\n\nSo then THEY become capable of seeing ghosts. But the original girl realizes the CG ghosts that were previously white are now turning red and are approaching her and EVERYONE KNOWS THAT RED IS THE SPOOKY COLOR TO INDICATE SPOOKINESS.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/GLkX3r5.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/ZRoPztB.png)~~~\n\nSo she runs. She gets the fuck out of there and QUICK, but CG ghosts are coming from every which way. She has spilled the beans of how to see ghosts to new people and therefore she must be punished BY BEING FORCED TO BECOME A GHOST. She runs to find her friend whom taught her the ways of the ghost finding, BUT SHE IS ALREADY DEAD AND HER CORPSE JUMP SCARES HER _OH NO_.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/PQ4rUUW.png)\n\nTHE RED CG GHOSTS ARE COMING FROM EVERYWHERE AND THERE IS NOWHERE ELSE TO RUN, and then it just fades to red and a bunch of voices of people spreading the secret of how to see ghosts ___and that is how Japan fell as a country___.\n\n__Ghosts murdered everyone in Japan.__\n\n...\n\n...This is the most clumsiest and shoddiest attempt to do a \"well you can only keep a secret among three people if two of them are dead\" story I've ever seen. Like the live action clown, I simply cannot believe this is an episode that exists. Clearly, the implication of the last thing being seen is the the ghosts reflection in the girl's eye is that oh no, now everybody who watched this episode of Yami Shibai are going to be haunted too. What a fucking joke.\n\nWait... oh fuck. THE GHOSTS ARE COMING THROUGH THE WALL, I HAVE TO VACATE THIS AREA UNTIL I CAN REACH A PHONE TO CALL ~!PARANORMAL INVESTIGATORS!~ SO WHILE I KNOW IT'S ABRUPT, THE REVIEW'S OVER.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/riWbe9R.png)\n\n___\n\n# ~~Out of Place~~ Heartwarming Ghost Story#\n\nNo, I was of course just joking. ~~I already have ghosts living inside of my brain, that's why I do anime reviews.~~ The review continues ~~unfortunately~~! Because there's actually more ICLA weirdness to discuss. The immediate next episode is so tonally out of place that it was an equally unexpected _but much less intense_ slap to the face as the previous episode was.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/wJeHtpH.png)\n\nBasically, a businessman encounters a weird creepy girl who is doing flower fortune telling. You know, pulling one petal and going _he loves me_, and then the next _he loves me not_ until all petals are gone. The moment the businessman's wife was brought up, I immediately predict that his wife is now a ghost (the way the businessman speaks about her obviously implies she's dead), and that the whole thing is she's coming to get her husband despite the fact he's still alive.\n\nThe flower girl is doing her fortunetelling of whether or not his wife's gonna come and get him and she's almost out of petals and she ends with \"your wife's gonna come for you.\"\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/OzBcaUb.png)\n\nImmediately, you expect a monstrous or at least spooky woman to appear, but no, his wife's ghost is all bright and emotional piano music is playing, and the husband sounds as if he's relieved, and willingly goes with his wife. The flower girl starts doing another flower of whether or not the guy is dead and I guess you could still interpret her final reading of \"you're dead\" to mean he died when he went with his wife's ghost but...\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/mloXKie.png)\n\nThe episode starts with him being caught within a rainstorm and waiting for it to stop, and him watching a couple leave while musing he was like them once. Therefore, I think the most logical conclusion is with this and the presentation of the wife ghost being not a spooky Yami Shibai ghost at all that the husband himself was actually dead as well and he himself was crossing over after being reunited with his wife.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/wAKmdUO.png)\n\n...This episode is a lot better than the last one, and honestly a lot better than the other episodes. The issue is, and I immediately thought this after watching the episode, what the fuck is it doing in Yami Shibai? No jump scares, no creepiness or spookiness really, just a heartwarming story about the ghosts of a wife and husband moving on with a completely random and unneeded fortune teller girl who is undetermined whether she herself is a ghost or not (\"I won't go home.\").\n\nI really would love to know any of the creative decisions for why these two episodes of Yami Shibai 5 exist. But... I never will, so let's move onto the final three ~~so we can end this already~~!\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/98QGlKm.png)\n___\n\n#A Woman's Creepy Reflection, Two-in-One, Preying Mantis Woman#\n\nEpisode eleven is pretty clear cut. I usually like psychological stuff, and the idea of the girl's massive vanity taking a life of its own works.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/02jJOJJ.png)\n\nIt's just... the end kind of sucks. Her reflection just comes out of the mirror towards her with a pair of scissors, and the screen fades to black as we hear the pair of scissors cutting. The fade to black ending aside, they've already done spooky girl with menacing pair of scissors. It's literally the only episode of season three I watched. Kind of think someone at ICLA had a bad experience getting their hair cut once or something, because I don't know why else they'd do the scissors thing twice. Scissors (unless you've specifically had a bad experience involving them) aren't scary!\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/F6PRk3j.png)\n\nThe second to last episode is pretty notable in the sense that it's probably the most incomprehensible Yami Shibai episode. Genuinely was not sure what was happening for part of the episode, which I guess is an accomplishment considering the episodes are like three minutes long. The idea of this episode was that two ghost stories were happening, or like one of the characters was telling a ghost story with the presentation of a mini Yami Shibai episode to one of the other characters. Or something. I really don't know, all I know is that it more or less ended exactly the same as many other Yami Shibai episodes do. The idea could have been neat I suppose, but they did not do it well at all.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/kntTqvj.png)\n\nFinally, we have the finale of the fifth season. Which perhaps notably or not notably does not begin with the opening of the Yami Shibai guy about to tell a ghost story to a bunch of children crowding around him. I guess the implication is that some detective is investigating into a Yami Shibai story. Which is fine sure, but why is the episode itself about a woman just turns into a human eating preying mantis? This genuinely feels like something that should have been in Sekai no Yami Zukan. There's no spookiness or creepiness, she just turns into a giant preying mantis and eats a guy.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/oEn0MZZ.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/bDzqx6N.png)~~~\n\n...Then Yami Shibai 5 ends. What the fuck.\n\n___\n\n#Riding off into the sunset for another season...?#\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/atkwlOt.png)\n\nOkay so, overall, absolutely terrible. Season one and two were at least hit or miss and the art remained at least somewhat consistent, and I think there was less clear laziness on ICLA's part. Less reusing the same drawings, I remember characters and etc moving more rather than just gliding around which... can I be honest? It just looks bad. When one of the characters just begins to move without any of their limbs or literally any part of them doesn't also move... I just kind of sigh.\n\nEspecially if the characters are supposed to be fleeing for their lives. I didn't even mention it because that's the least interestingly terrible thing about the episode, but it's REALLY BAD with the CG ghosts episode. Holy hell.\n\nBut in addition to just the general quality going downhill with every additional Yami Shibai season, if you just gaze back at season three...\n\nyoutube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdUfJCMP7rI)\n\n___What the fuck happened?___  There were actual monsters, and they actually could move! There seemed to be actual weirdness or creepiness and just overall effort put into it! Like as far as \"scariness\" goes, season one and two I'd probably guess is still better in that regard. I have zero ideas what season four was like, but I can't believe it's any worse than five is. Like I brought up in this review/was thinking of Sekai no Yami Zukan an upsetting number of times.\n\nThis may as well as been Sekai no Yami Zukan 1.5. Like I don't know if the Yami Shibai guy taking his bicycle off towards the sunset at the end was supposed to be like ICLA saying...\n\n_\"Okay, we'll be back for a season six!\"_\n\nOr...\n\n_\"Look guys, we just don't have it in us anymore. We're clearly out of ideas. We only did a four and a five to have a four and a five. This is already a pretty weak note for Yami Shibai to go out on sure, but what the fuck can we hope to do in a season six? We just... just need to let the mask guy ride off into the sunset for at least a little while.\"_\n\nI mean while I may think the original season (aka arguably when they were trying their hardest) was largely hit or miss, I do appreciate Yami Shibai's existence. The horror genre of anime is a bit... lacking, to be honest. There's nothing much else other than Yami Shibai that's of this particular flavor of horror where \"scares\" or being \"creeped out\" is the purpose of the show. There's plenty shows and series where yeah it's tagged as horror, but it's more or less just because there's gore or people die. I mean if you actually build an atmosphere or you have some genuinely disgusting or revolting stuff (should add that it has be to the \"good kind\"), like that's one thing.\n\nBut I don't know. [There might still be some hope](https://anilist.co/anime/99940/ItoJunjiCollection). Or I'll end up getting burned, and just go back to waiting for Yami Shibai 6 or a Sekai no Yami Zukan 2.\n\nA __3 out of 10.__\n\n~~~_...Oshimai._~~~\n\n~~~img500(https://i.imgur.com/IccaVlj.png)~~~"}, {"id": 2305, "score": 20, "body": "~~~_\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis world we live in is a dream.

I mixed the things up, I already reviewed _this_ [show](https://anilist.co/anime/21189/RanpoKitanGameofLaplace). What was I supposed to be reviewing then??? It was a fairly nonsensical show that annoyed me to no end, had ridiculous gore, and had this supposedly serious plot that drove me up a fucking wall but I'm forgetting the name of it. To be honest, I could see why I mixed it up with _that_ one... but what was the title???\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/yNnzB27.jpg)\n\nOh no. To punish my act of heresy the umbrellas have been sent out to strike me down via ___\"\"\"\"\"\"\"unfortunate accident\"\"\"\"\"\"\"___. But before I am executed by the eldritch umbrella lords that reign in the dark realms, I shall make an effort to review that which shall not be named. The very first anime that I watched and ended up having an OVERWHELMINGLY negative opinion on all around. But also I wasn't aware of even what the show was before starting it and also as a horror fan, the impact it left on me was even worse as a result.\n\n__ANOTHER.__ That's the title. I don't know how I forgot it since I've been wanting to ~~rag on~~ review this show ever since I watched it a year ago. So much that I bought the novel ~~(didn't read it)~~ and rewatched it AGAIN ~~(only partially)~~ just to fully remember how much it's just so... incomprehensibly __ANOTHER__.\n\n___\n\n\n#The ANOTHER Review#\n\n~~~img500(https://images8.alphacoders.com/639/639784.jpg)~~~\n\n___\n\n#Introduction#\n\nThe more lighthearted and bluntly comical aspects of these reviews I do aside, a Ranpo Kitan comparison right out of the gate may seem pretty harsh or even over the top. There certainly may be some similarities, but they are still also apples and oranges. \n\nRanpo Kitan is a very, VERY loose take on a [certain writer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edogawa_Ranpo)'s works pushed to the absolute max limits of absurdity. No, of course I'm not going to write a completely serious and drawn out review of a show that just straight up starts out with a 14 year old girl turned serial killer because she wanted her serial killer teacher to kill her and then TURN HER INTO A CHAIR. NOT JUST ANY CHAIR, BUT ___HIS CHAIR___. Because even if that show ends up developing a \"serious plot\" beyond that point, it's safe to assume that it's simply more absurdity, and yes it was.\n\n__ANOTHER__ on the other hand, is a firm adaptation of an actual novel by [Yukito Ayatsuji](https://anilist.co/staff/106882/YukitoAyatsuji) and is more than not, faithful and serious to the source material, brought to us by [P.A. Works](https://anilist.co/studio/132/PAWorks) who also made [Glasslip](https://anilist.co/anime/20645/Glasslip) (to be fair they also made [Shirobako](https://anilist.co/anime/20812/Shirobako) and [Uchouten Kazoku](https://anilist.co/anime/17909/UchoutenKazoku) which are GOOD). Therefore, while it's pretty absurd itself, I'm more inclined to criticize this show more seriously than I was with Ranpo Kitan which I guess is... ___something___. But still while I may have watched shows that are technically worse than __ANOTHER__, I have not watched anything else that has made me so grumpy that I've been writing a review for it in my head for like over a year.\n\nI guess this is my way of saying this review is going to be a fucking mess to both write as well as read because I'm going to address every single point I have about this goddamned show. Actually, let's do a table of contents just to be safe. Anime reviews shouldn't need those, but here we are.\n\n__Also, if you plan on watching this series no matter what, stop reading this review at this point.

Or Rather, The Gore.#\n\nBefore we move away from the gore and really delve into the negativity that will be comprising this entire review, I really just need to take a moment and say I really genuinely do love the gore. As a matter of fact, I'd honestly love to see P.A. Works do a horror anime in the future. They really do have the gore down.\n\nAs weird as it may be though, my favorite death in the entirety of Another is literally completely bloodless. While explosions of blood are usually always fun, I really just love the one scene towards the end where another character who is completely out of their mind at that point, is chasing the main characters and to do so, she follows them out of a window. But in her crazed state of bloodlust, her foot just happens to slip on the windowsill and she falls. The impact of her hitting the ground looks and sounds great.\n\nyoutube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWlH13Ka3Dk)\n\n_I actually did watch this when I still primarily watched English dubs. I can't believe there's actually a comical \"OH MY GOD\" right after she lands. Holy shit._\n___\n\n#No, Really. The Plot.#\n_No images are included for this section, because I believe they would be distracting._ \n\nAnyways, the plot is pretty simple. It's about a \"cursed\" high school class. The students don't really know if it's truly cursed or not, but there's a very clear trend of students of the glass dying over the top gory accidental deaths. Apparently, to the extent it's essentially suicide if you just go down a flight of stairs a little bit too fast while also carrying an umbrella. But basically, years and years ago, there was a female student named Misaki in the class that died tragically but then one day one of the students said no, she's right there like always.\n\nThen for some reason, the rest of the students and teacher basically start treating like she's there as well. To be fair, since this is a passed down story thing, obviously we, the audience, have no idea if it's actually bullshit or true. But apparently, this somehow started a tradition of a ghost or an undead person occasionally coming back in the class.\n\nBut then, the universe, or some invisible omniscient force doesn't like this one bit. This omniscient force, or, \"the Curse\", basically starts periodically causing anyone in the class or any family or friends of students of this ONE SPECIFIC CLASS of this school to die. Mind you, it's always in really gruesome or violent methods as well. Additionally, the school has gotten a new building, and it seems the \"ghost\" or \"Another\" has somehow transferred? Or it's link to the class itself? Like it's a different building, different actual room than the one that had the original Misaki person, but... it's haunted still? I don't think we're ever given answers as to if it's actually the original ghost of Misaki that's coming back as these non-existent fake students or... or... I don't know. I literally don't know.\n\nWhy am I even talking about the \"Another\"? Let's talk about the \"Curse\". The \"Curse\" is apparently capable of disrupting or disabling phones, is essentially omniscient but is incapable of figuring out who it actually needs to kill (the \"Another\") beyond killing randomly, is capable of straight up possessing people... and I think this one might be on the \"Another\" and not the \"Curse\", I'm not too sure, but something is capable of completely altering people's memories. __This is important. Be sure to mark it in the notes you should be taking to accompany the reading of this review. We'll be coming back to it later.__\n\nHowever, don't despair! There is in fact a way to combat the \"Curse\"! I guess the class, after a couple of goes through this repeating cycle, they just started trying random things? But apparently,  APPARENTLY, ignoring a completely random student of the class... helps? Sort of? The past classes still ended up having more students die so I don't know why they thought this would help. When a new arrival shows up and joins the class and seems INCAPABLE of catching a hint and just keeps talking to the chosen student to be ignored... they just say fuck it and ignore him as well??? As if they expect that to work?\n\nI really have no idea why this is a thing they decide to do in the first place or think it's going to work, but there's a lot more, and I just... let's move on.\n\nI already essentially declared this entire review was going to spoil basically the entire basic  idea of the show so... the real solution that'll stop the \"Curse\" is basically just giving it what it wants. Finding the \"Another\" and killing them. But there's basically no real way of finding out who it is.\n\nThere's absolutely no established way any character can find out who it is. But hey, there just happens to be a student in the class with the last name Misaki (you know, the name of the ghost from the original class) and she just happens to be the one they all decide to ignore. That's convenient. I mean that's obviously just a red herring. Obviously, she can't be the \"Another\". That'd be too obvious.\n\n~!But she does have a hidden ability that would allow her to be able to tell right away if a person was the \"Another\" or not, if she wanted to. She has it the entire show. It's actually established that she has it the entire show. This is a thing that is true about this show and apparently the novel as well. MORE ABOUT THIS TO FOLLOW FURTHER DOWN.!~\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking. TGG, when are you going to get to talking about the plot? Okay yeah we get the omniscient curses and dead people returning as fake people, but what's the plot???\n\nSlice of life about middle schoolers with vague supernatural/mystery elements, and also a lot of gore and death happens. That's really the heart of it, or what matters. The \"Curse\" is idiotic and I hate it for reasons I'll get into later in another section, the \"Another\"... what the fuck was even its goal? It's not like they did anything nefarious really. It's the fucking \"Curse\" that's going around causing gruesome deaths.\n\nIt's not like the fake ghost person needed to be evil or antagonistic but... it would have been neat for it to be SOMETHING? Because... what it actually turns out to be is terrible. To the extent it has its own completely spoiler filled section.\n\nBut hey. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Plot aside, maybe the characters themselves are interesting or... entertaining in some way. There has to be something, right? THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING.\n\n___\n\n# \"Characters\" #\n\nUh. I may have bit off more than I could chew with this one. Describing Another's characters is... a challenge. Because there are a good portion of them that are completely forgettable, and the few ones that are still rattling around in my brain somewhere, I can't really say anything more than \"well, their name is blank and they're a middle schooler\".\n\nThinking about it, if I wanted to, I could probably rehash the joke I made when I reviewed Glasslip. But actually with Another, I think with the exception of one (you may already know which one I'm referring to!), I think there's even less memorable characters. Because at least with Glasslip, I could remember things to actually criticize about them. In any case...\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/pKVJfq5.jpg)\n\nHere's our main character. His name is Kouichi Sakakibara. He is a middle schooler, and is an apparent horror fan because he had one Stephen King book at one point. He's not ever shown actually really being a \"horror fan\" so you might wonder what is the purpose of that scene or even showing a Stephen King book. But I'm sorry to tell you that you haven't descended far down enough into this review to find out yet because yes, that is another dedicated section of this review. Oh... and, I guess he had like a health problem or whatever, and that's why he doesn't know everyone is ignoring one specific student to apparently fend off omniscient curses that are mad about the existence of ghosts.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/FAbqVSH.jpg)\n\nKubodera is apparently the name of the class' teacher that kills himsel--wait. Apparently he killed himself not because the \"Curse\" takes him over but because he realizes all the class' stupid moronic rule about ignoring a person doesn't stop the \"Curse\" and he just goes crazy??? Was that seriously what happened? I don't even remember the teacher being aware that the \"Curse\" was a thing. I seriously remember just fucking thinking that scene comes out of literally nowhere but maybe I was just so fucking numbed by that point that I missed or forgot scenes with the teacher... there was actually more stuff about the omniscient curse possessing people but now I'm kind of worried that with those as well I might have just forgotten scenes. ~!Or maybe the inn's caretakers really were just random serial killers coincidentally while the entire class fucking turns on itself and everyone starts murdering everyone.!~\n\nThough, that just underlines my point of... why purposely do it in front of your class which I guess he apparently cared about before going completely batshit insane? Because horror, I guess. To be fair, that scene was probably the best scene of Another (though as previously mentioned, it's not my favorite gore scene) in my opinion. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/2RN0VWC.jpg)\n\nBut let's get back to the characters... enter, middle-schooler... uh... hold on. I truly do remember their names off the top of my head, I'm not simply opening character pages at random. Oh! Yukari Sakuragi! That's the umbrella girl! She's a middle schooler whose favorite hobby is being brutally killed via umbrellas!\n\n...It feels like I'm just wasting time talking about these bit players in the grand presentation that is Another. Fuck it. Let's do it. Let's get to the real protagonist of Another.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/Y7bQ8BM.png)\n\nOH! THERE HE IS. THE UMBRELLA ITSELF. WHAT A MAJESTIC AND WELL-FLESHED OUT CHARACTER. I KNOW YOU MAY HAVE THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO TALK ABOUT EYEPATCH GIRL  (eyepatch girl is Misaki girl but not original Misaki girl that was a ghost, just coincidentally happens to share the same name as ghost) BUT I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT EYEPATCH GIRL BEYOND ALL OF THE CLICHES SHE IS MADE UP OF AS WELL AS HER DEUS EX EYEPATCH. WHICH, AND I KNOW, YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY GOTTEN SICK OF HEARING THIS IF YOU'RE STILL READING, BUT WILL BE COVERED IN A FOLLOWING SECTION OF THIS REVIEW.\n\n~~_It happens to be the very next one though._~~\n\n___\n\n#The Prequel OVA.#\n\nBefore we get into the true meat of this review and discuss the bulk of WHY I really dislike this show (aside from the plot and characters), I have to go a little bit into HOW I watched this show. There is an OVA for Another. It seems super irrelevant and detached from the actual plot and events of Another, but...\n\n__This is really where the true spoilers of this review begin. I really want to hammer this home. This'll be the last time, though.__\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/d0eHUqu.jpg)\n\nOkay, imagine you watch a show and at one point, a character basically reveals that they are capable of this hugely massive ability that essentially solves the main mystery and conflict of the show. Sure, it's kind of bullshit, but then an OVA comes along afterward and it sort of expands on that and explains why that character keeps quiet about this ability.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/b3AEgSU.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/ExAcJyh.png)~~~\n\nYou say well okay, that explains that. Or maybe you still (rightfully) think it's stupid, but now that the OVA is over, you're done. You're out.\n\nImagine... imagine someone watching that... BEFORE... the rest of the actual show. Because chronologically... it precedes it. In fact, it explains why that character is where they are in the very first episode and a lot about that character. But, while you know more about this character, you also know what they're capable of. Then when you learn more about what the actual plot/conflict of Another is, you just go...\n\n...Why won't she just take the eyepatch off? I know watching the prequel OVA first was the wrong way to go about it, but since the OVA itself is an adaptation of a side novel, that means this is genuinely something the original author established. She has this ability literally the entire time. She could have seen who the \"Another\" was, THE ENTIRE TIME. ANY SCENE WHERE SHE IS TALKING TO THE PERSON WHO THE \"ANOTHER\" IS, IF SHE JUST WASN'T WEARING THE GODDAMNED EYEPATCH, SHE WOULD KNOW. IMMEDIATELY.\n\nThat whole reasoning of... well, she doesn't want to see when people die and etc due to that whole thing with her twin sister, SHOULD HAVE WENT OUT OF THE WINDOW WHEN SHE REALIZED THAT SHE COULD HAVE USED THIS ABILITY TO STOP THE \"CURSE\" WHICH IS WHAT IN FACT KILLED HER TWIN SISTER.\n\nSHE COULD HAVE PREVENTED SO MANY DEATHS. BUT SHE DIDN'T. BECAUSE EYEPATCH. BECAUSE SHE'S THE EYEPATCH GIRL AND SHE NEEDS HER EYEPATCH TO LIVE.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/v4nC0xd.png)\n\n___\n\n#Cameo Starring Stephen King.#\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/sSUIvNZ.png)\n\nLet's talk about this now. Stephen King is probably [my favorite author](https://i.imgur.com/60zhOZ3.png), I've literally read every book the man has published up until like recently when he started like a trilogy of detective novels. I don't know how I possibly could have forgotten about this on the first time I went through the show, but this was like a punch to the face in attempting to rewatch Another for this review. Because...\n\n~~~img100(https://i.imgur.com/l1wCy8E.jpg)~~~\n\nPet Sematary is one of the \"old King\" books, and is genuinely a creepy idea for a horror novel. Yes, it's the one where a guy buries things in a Pet Sematary that is haunted by Native Americans or whatever, but the story behind it is fucked. One day, one of Stephen King's toddler sons almost got hit by a truck in a street, and he proceeded to write Pet Sematary. Which is essentially... the character in the book DOESN'T manage to get his son out of the street before the truck comes. The father character is so fucked up by this that after having resurrected the family cat via Pet Sematary, he proceeds to do it again but with his son.\n\nPoint is, while there's a much simpler explanation (it's probably in the novel too, and the author was probably a fan because how could you possibly get a \"horror\" novel published without coming in contact with Stephen King material in some shape or form) why this is a thing, it's really silly at almost the very start of a \"horror\" show to immediately have a reference to Stephen King. Let alone one of his more famous novels (really, almost all of it is from before he quit the drugs and also before his accident in 2000). Because, it immediately gives the audience expectations.\n\n~~~img220(https://i.imgur.com/gYo6Jy3.jpg)~~~\n\n\"Stephen King??? I know that name! He's that guy who [wrote all of the horror novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King_bibliography)! [The Shining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Cb3ik6zP2I)! That book that ruined [clowns as a real occupation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVK72QH6hLk)! The [one about the haunted car](https://i.imgur.com/nKOjH40.jpg)! The [other one about the haunted car](https://i.imgur.com/Cz7eUO3.jpg)! If it's bringing Stephen King into this, it's gotta be good horror!\"\n\nBut then it isn't, and apart from the occasional gore, it's \"omniscient curse\" this, \"hey we have to ignore this random girl to stop the omniscient curse\" that, and urgh.\n\nGetting back to the omniscient curses, and while we're still on the subject of Stephen King... and... I believe the comparison is fair considering this series brought Stephen King into this itself, let's talk about Stephen King's IT.\n\n~~~img100(https://i.imgur.com/NPtz3GI.jpg)~~~\n\nI just want to briefly talk about this because it was sort of blowing my mind the more I thought about it. \n\nAnother is about this small town and there's this omniscient thing that is brutally killing middle schoolers every couple of years or so and for the most part, it seems like the rest of the town outside of those connected to the class itself are completely blind to all these fucking HORRIBLE GRISLY BLOODY DEATHS that are happening to these bunch of middle schoolers. The actual plot of Another is a bunch of the students in the class try to combat and stop the curse that's brutally killing them one by one.\n\nStephen King's IT is about this small town and there's this omniscient entity that is brutally killing and eating people (IT's favorite meal is of course terrified children) and it does this like every twenty seven years, and IT is actively manipulating the entire town to ignore the mass amounts of missing children and death that just seems to roll around every twenty seven years, and in some instances, even makes other people in the town contribute to the violence.  The actual plot of IT is a bunch of kids try to stand up to IT and stop it for good while it is essentially omniscient and EATS CHILDREN.\n\nWhile IT is an omniscient force that is essentially fucking with everything in this town, it's an actual character, has motivation, has a physical form, and is genuinely menacing. Another's \"omniscient curse\" is... is a faceless force that we never see, that's only causing random grisly deaths because of the existence of the \"Another\" and when the \"Another\" dies, it just fucks off until a new \"Another\" appears.\n\nSure, yeah. The gore's great and yes, you can't go wrong with seeing kids die in over the top and gruesome ways. Like come on, speaking realistically, WHAT ARE THE ODDS OF FALLING DOWN THE STAIRS IN SUCH A PERFECT WAY THAT YOUR NECK IS TARGET #1 FOR THAT UMBRELLA? THAT SHIT WOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED IF INVISIBLE MURDER FORCE WASN'T ON THE SCENE.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/BwBN0hb.gif)~~~\n___\n\n#Doesn't Work as a Cheap Horror Either.#\n\nThis is where we get into some shit. I've made it apparent enough that I don't think the actual serious plot of Another works or is even really entertaining to watch. But I also don't even think it really works as a cheap silly horror that you just sit down to watch specifically to see kids/teems die.\n\nYes, that's right. Horror fans love seeing kids/teens [die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Voorhees) [die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Nightmare_on_Elm_Street) [die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evil_Dead) [die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beware!_Children_at_Play) [die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughter_High) [DIE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chopping_Mall) [DIE](https://i.imgur.com/mioAz5U.jpg) [DIE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Texas_Chain_Saw_Massacre) [DIE](https://i.imgur.com/1tN4B8Y.jpg) [DIE](https://i.imgur.com/uKwwnMf.jpg)--ahem, excuse me. The ghosts that live inside my brain took control of the keyboard momentarily.\n\nAnyways, let's just bite the bullet and finally talk about the [Final Destination series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Destination). \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/TKvKPze.jpg)\n\nI know this review is all over the place, as this is now the third thing I've brought in to compare to Another but... this is without a doubt the one that makes the most sense. Basically a character has a premonition or whatever before they and their friends die horrible deaths and uses that newly gained knowledge to avoid... that death.\n\nBut basically, they were actually fated to die then, so \"Death\" itself is essentially out for them. One by one, they start to die in ridiculous or over the top ways. This was literally years ago and I thankfully didn't watch all of them. It may or may not have been the one with the rollercoaster, I literally don't remember, but there was that one death where like after a convoluted series of events, a girl ends up trapped in an active tanning bed thing and [she dies from tanning bed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaz73KCiKaM).\n\nThough you know, these movies worked (for what they were and that was the Final Destination series so that was a low bar to begin with) because while there was a plot, it was dumb, silly, and obviously the characters dying in over the top ways was the entire point. Whereas Another has a bunch of nothing characters, this whole ghost story angle, and I think honestly the \"annoying\" outweighs all of the gore.\n\nThe fact that the main way to apparently combat this \"Curse\" just being ignoring a random student in the class is just... infuriating to me. Because since nobody but this one person can see or interact with this person, obviously the first conclusion you go to is \"well, she's probably a ghost\" but nope, they're just ignoring her to somehow combat some weird omniscient curse that's causing everyone to die somehow but then later they just accuse her of being the \"Another\" anyways.\n\nAt least in Final Destination, they don't pull any punches and straight up say it's Death itself.\n\nBut hey, what do you know. There's another similarity between Another and Final Destination. There are videos on Youtube of all of the deaths in both.\n\n~~I'm definitely not making the suggestion to just watch the \"deaths\" video and just leave it at that. That's definitely not what's happening here.~~\n\nyoutube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H87bqxAAymc) \nyoutube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYPY7Lq63kw)\n\nIt's almost like THAT'S WHAT WE WANTED TO SEE. GIVE ME GRISLY SCENES OF TEENAGERS DYING BRUTAL AND HORRIBLE DEATHS AND HOLD THE HELPING OF A SERIOUS PLOT, PLEASE. AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO INCLUDE ONE, MAYBE MAKE IT A GOOD ONE.\n\nGOD. \n___\n\n#Cliches.#\n\nHere we go. _Here we fucking go._\n\nimg440(http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wez9dDc70E8/Umr4wnyvxwI/AAAAAAAABZ0/ir9YhM4hQ6U/s1600/Another_ep12a.png)\n\nOkay, let's start with \"Eyepatch Girl.\" She is literally a walking mass of cliches. She is a quiet loner girl and literally the entire reason why \"Main Guy\" gets wrapped up in all of this \"Another\" nonsense is because the show seems to continually push him towards \"Eyepatch Girl.\"\n\nWhy is she wearing an eyepatch? Why is she so quiet? Why is she usually always alone? Why does nobody talk to her? Why is she wearing an eyepatch? Why did she show up randomly at the morgue level of the hospital holding a doll? Why is she wearing an eyepatch? Why aren't both of her eyes the same color? Why does she live in a building that's just full of weird spooky dolls? Why does she share the name of the original \"Another\" ghost from the story? Is she related to the original Misaki ghost? Why is she wearing an eyepatch? WHY IS SHE WEARING AN EYEPATCH? Oh... the eyepatch is because she lost one of her real eyes and had [a doll's eye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUuH4TEmgLo) put in as a replacement and that somehow gives her the ability to see who is alive and who isn't and who is going to die and etc?\n\nWell, why the fuck does putting a doll's eye in your empty eye socket give you that ability? Actually, how does it even work as an actual eye? If she was just a ghost person, there'd be no questions. But since she's purposely such a weird character, THERE ARE VARIOUS QUESTIONS TO BE ASKED ABOUT HER AND BASICALLY NONE OF THEM END UP BEING ANSWERED. To be fair, some of them are answered in the prequel OVA solely about \"Eyepatch Girl\" but I didn't find that satisfying at all.\n\nThe entire purpose of that prequel OVA/prequel novel honestly seems to be just to cover that huge fucking flaw of her suddenly just knowing who the \"Another\" is because she decided to take off her eyepatch in the actual main series. Like okay yeah, she had a twin sister who ~!previous to the start of the actual series died as a result of the \"Curse\".!~ But what relevancy does that twin sister play for anything? It explains why \"Eyepatch\" was in the morgue level in the very first episode, and why she was creeped out about her eye ability thing, but I've already went into why that should have just given her motivation to try and actually stop the \"Curse\" by finding the \"Another.\"\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/MdLfnRt.png)\n\nAlso, you know why she lives in like a doll shop? Because dolls are creepy and creepy is horror  of course, don't you know. The doll shop and the dolls just felt so fucking out of place that I just can't get over it. Okay yes, dolls and mannequins are frequently used in horror, I understand. But... what fucking relevance does any of it play? None really. Like, if they had just said that \"Eyepatch Girl\" was just born with her ability thing and it wasn't from a doll's eye, nothing would be changed. At all. In fact, her just being born with it would be easier to wrap my head around than... why did they decide to just put a doll's eye as a replacement after a four year old loses their eye? Who made that decision? Why did they make that decision?\n\nI've been talking too much about the plot and character stuff. Let's briefly talk about a couple of the more horror-y scenes of Another (apart from the gore because you KNOW horror ABSOLUTELY has to have gore in it for it to be horror) and why they are ALSO terrible.\n\nyoutube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh48D2q4H7w)\nyoutube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPtcJBb9_KU)\n\nBoth of those are probably among my favorite scenes of Another (of which there aren't many) and... they both end exactly the same way. The \"Main Guy\" is just having a nightmare. Oh. So, what you're really telling me here, is none of that mattered at all because it was just dreams. \"Wow, some creepy stuff is finally happening!\"\n\nNo, it's all just a dream. Good. Great. Wonderful. Fantastic.\n\nimg300(https://i.imgur.com/YnhBQLY.png)\n\nThen, there's that whole thing with the tape that is what reveals to the students that the only way to beat the omniscient curse is to find out who the \"Another\" is and kill them. Everything about this tape is really... it really just gets my goat. The characters who find and listen to it realize what sort of reaction the class is going to have if they're told that murder is the solution to stop everyone from dying, so they correctly decide that telling everyone this information is probably not a great idea given the absolute fear everyone's going into. Yet... they don't hide the tape somewhere reasonably hard for them to find? Actually, they straight up take it to the inn place where the entire end of the show happens and that's when the show just completely collapses into craziness and gore.\n\nTo be fair, it's to show \"Eyepatch\" and \"Main Guy\" but... why just leave it lying around where others can find it?\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/i9jNp0L.jpg)\n\nBecause one of the other students finds the tape, listens to it, and goes oh SHIT. THE QUICKEST WAY TO MAKE SURE NOT EVERYONE DIES IS MURDER. AND THAT JUST STARTS THE BALL ROLLING, PEOPLE START KILLING EACH OTHER, THE INN BECOMES ON FIRE, ONE OF THE INNKEEPERS JUST FUCKING GOES CRAZY AND STARTS KILLING PEOPLE TOO. It's all... it's all just nonsense from there on out.\n\nWe're not done with the tape though. First of all, I need to explain that I am okay with cliche or campy horror tropes. As long as they're done appropriately (in a fun way and in something that is purposely of the \"fun horror\" category), I'm fine with them. But when characters in this more or less played straight show decide to... like all they do is basically transfer the tape's message to a CD, and then they put that CD in a locker in their classroom just like the last class did. \n\n...Like are you kidding me? WHEN YOU, THE NEXT CLASS, FINALLY NEEDED THE TAPE, IT WAS STILL IN THE OLD AND ABANDONED BUILDING. WHY ARE YOU JUST TAKING IT ON FAITH THAT NOBODY'S GONNA FIND THE TAPE OR MESS WITH THAT LOCKER OR THAT THEY'RE NOT GONNA GET A NEW _NEW_ BUILDING? ADDITIONALLY, WHY NOT ADD LIKE ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS OR MAKE IT EASIER TO FIND? IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE YOU'RE GRUMPY THAT ALL YOUR FRIENDS ARE DEAD SO YOU WANT THE NEXT CLASS TO GO THROUGH THE __SAME EXACT SHIT__. THIS IS THE FINAL EPISODE'S POST CREDITS SCENE, THIS IS LITERALLY THE FINAL NOTE THE SHOW GOES OUT ON.\n\nWHY DID NOT ALL THE CHARACTERS DIE. THIS SHOW WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT IF ALL OF THEM HAD DIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE \n\n___\n\n#Mood Whiplash.#\n\nEverybody seems to be dying brutal and bloody deaths and we don't seem to be making much progress if any at all towards stopping it.\n\n\"LET'S GO TO THE FUCKING BEACH. BEACH EPISODE! LET'S GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/cogqYQs.gif)\n\nAre you kidding me? I perfectly understand the purpose of why this is a thing. Basically just to demonstrate, even if you do leave the town, there's no escaping omniscient curses because yes, there is a death this episode. But this is like episode eight. Isn't it a little bit late to be pulling these shenanigans? I don't know maybe, it's better in the nov--\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/qGuI1Up.png)\n\nOH SHIT. IN THE NOVEL THEY DON'T JUST DECIDE RANDOMLY TO GO TO THE BEACH? OH SHIT. THIS ONE ISN'T ON YUKITO AYATSUJI, THIS IS ALL P.A. WORKS' DOING. I'm just surprised they didn't decide to [go hiking instead](https://i.imgur.com/ip2cBE1.png). You could have one of the students get mauled to death by a bear or something. It's because of the \"Curse\" that one of the students had his face ripped off by a bear!\n\n~~To be fair, this is one of the episodes I enjoyed the most because the twist and the idea is just so goofy. \"Sure yeah, you can do a beach episode, but you still have to have someone die horribly.\"~~\n\nActually. [Here you go.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tu7rFtEZ-M) Here's two scenes from Another that both simultaneously exist that I slammed together with shitty video editing.\n\nMy overall point with this is really, I consistently did not know what Another wanted from me. If it wanted to be seen as this serious thing about this ghost story thing or if it wanted to be seen as an anime version of Final Destination. I just could not wrap my head around it the entire time I was watching it and as time passed once the final episode ended, like a rumbling storm of growing discontent my opinions of this show worsened more and more as I continued to think about it.\n\nWas I supposed to be scared? Was I supposed to be laughing? Was I supposed to be [cringing from all of the crazy gore](https://i.imgur.com/oQrQ9b1.png)? Was I supposed to [care about these character](https://i.imgur.com/5f36xhZ.png)s or think they were deep in any way shape or form? Even now, I still really don't know. From skimming the novel, it seems like a serious enough novel this guy wrote. Like at no point watching this show did I feel like... like it was intentionally bad, like Ranpo Kitan. But whereas Another is originally a novel a person actually wrote and thought out, Ranpo Kitan was just a bunch of ideas ripped straight from a deceased famous mystery writer and done completely over the top and in a horrible way.\n\nI don't know. Almost the entire time, I was just bored and mildly grumpy whenever gore wasn't happening. Mind you, it's not like I wanted even more of it. There was plenty considering the later end of the show just delves into complete over the top schlock. That's also about when I ended up feeling a completely different emotion.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/tqz5WCR.jpg)\n\nGenuine anger.\n\n___Next section is ENTIRELY on the ending of the show.___\n___\n\n#M. Night Shyamalan is a Hack Fraud.#\n_Context:_ [M. Night Shyamalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Night_Shyamalan) _made_ [that one movie with the twist ending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sixth_Sense) _and basically ever since then, he's made_ [horrible shit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Night_Shyamalan#Filmography) _and basically they almost all have twist endings._\n\nThroughout the rest of the show, the negativity I had towards it was only like a low rumbling in the pit of my stomach. After all, I started the show with absolutely no knowledge of it. Didn't know about all the gore, didn't know about the umbrella, didn't know the concept, etc. The entire way through, I was trying my hardest to give it a chance. But then the whole stretch with the inn or whatever it was happened.\n\nThat ending is absolutely the most garbage thing about this series. \n\nOkay, first of all. The entire show you're led to believe that the \"Another\" is a student, and at this point, the students have mostly completely flipped their shit and are going crazy trying to kill \"Eyepatch\" because they believe that she's the \"Another\" and are dying due to the fire that starts somehow or being murdered by one of the innkeepers who just coincidentally decides to go insane (I really can't believe that the \"curse\" really had NOTHING to do with that. They just \"go crazy\" and that's it.) while all this is happening.\n\nBut guess what? It's a fucking teacher. It wasn't even the teacher of the actual cursed class because he already committed suicide at this point. So basically all of that conflict among the students apparently was for absolutely nothing. Not to even mention the fact that there's no possible way that the viewer could ever actually figure out who the \"Another\" is, there's absolutely no clues or anything. Like, the \"Another\" is perfectly nice to the characters and doesn't do anything nefarious at all throughout the entire show.\n\nNot to mention that apparently when an \"Another\" appears, it can completely alter the memories of other people. So it turns out that the \"Another\" is actually \"Main Guy's\" aunt, and his memories were altered to include memories of his fake dead aunt so he'd think that yeah she's totally an actual living person. There are various problems with this.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/UJzkLOC.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/1zyuC3N.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/y3DJryJ.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/xUcY2Mw.png)~~~\n\nNumber one. The entire purpose of the \"Another\" turning out to be his aunt all along had to be either just to try and have a shocking twist ending, or to try and get an emotional reaction from the viewer. Like oh no, now \"Main Guy\" is going to put a pickaxe through his \"Fake Aunt\" who is the \"Another.\"\n\nNumber two. Since the memories are fake, while \"Main Guy\" is being emotional, the viewer has no fucking reason to care about this at all. THE MEMORIES ARE FAKE. SHE IS THE \"ANOTHER\" AND THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THE DEATHS ARE TOTALLY ENTIRELY THE FAULT OF THE \"CURSE\" (\"oh no, I chased my classmates out of a window with a knife and I accidentally slipped, fell, and died. DAMN YOU, CURSE!\") IS BY KILLING HER. MAKE HER DIE FOR THE SECOND TIME SO THE SHOW CAN END.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/q0FKRci.png)\n\nNumber three. The presentation of the \"Another\" is... baffling. \"Main Guy\" comes out and there's his aunt under a thing, unable to get out, struggling, and she looks like an undead. This... this is what the entire show has been leading up to! AND HE JUST PICKS UP A THING AND PUTS IT THROUGH THE BACK OF HER SKULL.\n\nNumber four. After she dies, everybody else but \"Eyepatch\" and \"Main Guy\" completely forget about her, but still remember the \"Curse\" and all of the deaths that happen and primarily most of the deaths throughout the \"inn arc\" happened resulting from the chaos that initially sparked by the class going mostly crazy about wanting to kill \"Eyepatch\" because they thought she was the \"Another.\" But \"Eyepatch\" wasn't killed, so why did the students ever believe that \"the Curse\" had really ended. Did they just believe \"Eyepatch\" and \"Main Guy\"'s word? But they were literally just trying to kill \"Eyepatch\" not even that long ago and \"Main Guy\" is clearly Team Eyepatch so why would they trust...\n\nThey obviously didn't forget about \"the Curse\" because if they had, then why would the two other students have went to the trouble to putting back the tape that has the instructions of how to stop \"the Curse\"???\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/OsodF8a.png)\n\nI just... it's just a fucking mess. Not to even mention that, they literally didn't even fully stop \"the Curse\". Therefore, there IS going to be a new cursed class down the line. But the students of THIS cursed class are basically like... \"well most of us are dead at this point, let's just try and move on and maybe the next cursed class will be able to stop it entirely or at least before almost the entire class is dead.\"\n\nThis has to be one of the worst endings I've ever seen. Or at the very least, it's one of the ones that have genuinely upset me the most. You know what I was waiting for? I was waiting for \"Main Guy\" to wake up in his bed AGAIN and go \"OH SHIT THAT WAS A FUCKED UP DREAM.\"\n\nThat would have been the only way to top what the actual ending is. It was all a goddamned dream, FIN.\n___\n\n#Conclusion. I Hate This Fucking Anime.#\n\nYou know, there's another reason why I opened this review with a comparison to Ranpo Kitan. The Ranpo Kitan review I did, if I had actually bothered to go into all of the problems I had with its \"plot\", that review would have looked like this one. Instead, it was so incomprehensible that I couldn't bring myself to believe that anyone who worked on it even partially believed that it would be taken seriously or well received. But since Another is more serious and less batshit insane, it actually bothers me more?\n\nSure yes, Ranpo Edogawa's grave was danced on, and then a[ completely different series](https://anilist.co/anime/21832/TRICKSTEREdogawaRampoShounenTanteidanyori) came back for a second helping and danced on it again. But with Ranpo Kitan, I could at least laugh at it.\n\nBefore we get to the score, I'm just gonna really quickly gather a recap of all of my major points in a nice bullet list form. Because if any TGG review ever needed a summary, it's this one.\n\n- The gore is genuinely great. To the point it's literally the only strong point of the entire show.\n\n- While explosions of blood are nice, you can also do a completely bloodless death with it still having the sort of impact you want from a show/series like this.\n\n- The plot is needlessly complicated and done in an annoying way. Basically boils down to people won't stop dying in horrifically gory ways a la Final Destination, but it has to be this whole fucking thing. The curse will get you before you can leave town, the curse will cause calls to cut out when convenient, ignoring a random person can somehow combat the curse (except when it doesn't), the \"Another\" can alter memories, etc.\n\n- Basically no interesting characters at all, and the single one that's even remotely close is infuriating. Even for a cheap/cheesy horror thing where the entire point is you're there to see characters die, this is pretty fucking bad.\n\n- The most infuriating thing about the plot is made even worse because there's an entire prequel OVA/side novel that seems like its entire purpose is to rub salt into the wound.\n\n- Stephen King's name should never have been brought up. Period. Even if this was a good horror, why even do it? It's not necessary. And if the \"horror fan\" aspect of \"Main Guy\"'s character actually would have gone somewhere, you didn't need to specifically throw Stephen King's name out there because he's the horror author that LITERALLY EVERYONE IN THE UNIVERSE knows.\n\n- Cheap horror does not work if there is a primarily serious tone to it. Look, eventually, all I'm saying is, Jason eventually started beating campers in [a sleeping bag against a tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF629C5WRqU) and also [he went to space](https://i.imgur.com/d4w3kkw.png). Fun fact, apparently both of those are [the same fucking movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_X).\n\n- Final Destination is better than Another.\n\n- \"Eyepatch Girl\" is a walking cocktail mix of cliches. There are a whole bunch of other horror cliches, but let's stop with the dream sequences that literally only happen to include \"spooky\" scenes. Let's please stop that.\n\n- Inconsistent tone, and the beach episode.\n\n- At this point, twist endings are more trouble than they're worth. Because the odds your twist ending ends up being fucking dumb or out of nowhere are RIDICULOUSLY HIGH. But hey, Another's was memorable and frustrating enough to cause me to write a 8,000+ word review of it over a year later.\n\nOkay, with all of that being said, I give this a show a __10 out of 10__ for all of the gore and the eyepatch girl who is legitimately my most favorite anime character of all time. Goodbye! That's the end! This is the last review I'm ever writing! It's the end, it's the end forever. These reviews are never coming back, it's the end, it's over.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/NDH2Ppc.png)\n___\n\n#Climax.#\n\n\"Gee, I think I might have actually went overboard with this one.

We do not know who is originally responsible for deciding they wanted to see the original work in manga form, but it is far too late to dissuade any such person from bringing this into the world._\n\n_We have provided a survey of questions to other subjects that we have exposed to Qualia. Although, Subject T-33 will be the one who will be penning the review, we will disperse the questions and the answers of the other subjects periodically throughout this review._\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/NRd3a54.png)\n\n_But for right now, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take a peek and see how Subject T-33 is faring with Qualia the second time through._\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPlease. Please stop it. Please stop forcing these images and words into my brain. You can't just... you can't do any of this. The science... I can't even pretend to be qualified to point out all that's wrong with it, but there's no way any of this is correct. Schrodinger's Cat... SCHRODINGER'S CAT! WHERE DID THAT DARN CAT GET TO?? IS IT IN THE BOX?? OR IS IT NOT IN THE BOX?? OR IS IT DEAD?? IS IT ALIVE?? WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH PARALLEL UNIVERSES? HELLO? HELP?\"\n\n_Ah yes, those sure are some results we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting from T-333. I believe we made the correct choice in choo--_\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRemember when this was about a girl who sees everybody else as robots? Remember that? Whatever happened to that? Why is... why is alternate universes? Why is anything?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n_Ahem, yes. Qualia the Purple is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 even we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not too sure how to classify it. Slice of life\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 sci-fi\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 fantasy\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 action\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 mystery\u00e2\u0080\u00a6?_ \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/Dh4QaJj.png)\n\n_Or perhaps, or perhaps, it is simply outright nonsense disguised to be otherwise? For if one were to simply go off of the description alone, one would imagine it would be a pretty generic if somewhat strange premise for a series. Why, it even starts off that way._\n\n_But then perhaps the original creator took a massive amount of drugs and lost track of their mental facilities the rest of the time they were writing it and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how Qualia became the way it is._\n\n_Such a strange creation with downright bizarre and insane elements requires a more\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 scientific and methodical approach to dissecting it. That is where we, Theoretical Generalizing Goblins come into the picture. However, we had a bit of trouble finding suitable willing subjects... hence, we had to get a little bit rough with Subject T-33 who repeatedly refused to voluntarily review Qualia._\n\n_Subject T-33 shall now begin his review. __Subject T-33 has claimed that it will be impossible to review this manga without going into full spoilers. Therefore, those reading this later should take this into note prior continuing past this point. The Theoretical Generalizing Goblins group recommends if you intend on studying this work no matter what, you go into it completely blind first. But if you think you will not endure the journey, then witness the sufferings of Subject T-33 below first__._\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/hFrzcUN.png)\n\n_It should be explicitly noted that the above is actually from the manga itself and not a creation of our making which we included in R-28. But the message works here as well as in the manga itself._\n\n___\n\n#R-28: Schrodinger's Plot#\n\nThey have me in a padded room and they forced my eyes open as they projected each chapter of Qualia on the wall, and they have told me I cannot leave until I finish this review. After being forced to reread this manga, it makes me realize that there are things much more preposterous than some secret society with Goblins in the name going around abducting people to force them to review manga.\n\nThe original premise of this manga starts out simple enough. The two main characters of this manga are ordinary high school girls, except... the one that has PURPLE eyes apparently sees literally everyone else and every other living creature...\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/RGMlrra.png)\n\n...as robots. See a cat? Guess what, that's not a cat. It's a cat shaped robot. See your best friend you've known for years? Guess what, they're a robot. EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING IS A ROBOT EXCEPT FOR YOU. YOU ARE THE ONLY LIVING ORGANIC HUMAN BEING IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE, EVERYTHING ELSE IS JUST ROBOTS. THE PROOF THAT YOU ARE A HUMAN IS IN FACT YOUR PURPLE EYES BECAUSE THE TITLE OF MANGA HAS THE WORD PURPLE IN IT.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/tpupSlm.png)\n\nBut you see, this is weird in itself. Extremely so, but if the entire manga was solely about JUST that, then I wouldn't... I wouldn't be sitting here in a padded room because of this manga. No, the plot has many twists and turns, ups and downs... Schrodinger's Cat makes a cameo appearance.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/4PXiuOg.png)\n\nMy favorite chapter of this manga was the one where they just go on and on about Schrodinger's Cat. I have always been so interested in Schrodinger and his Cat. Why I never once thought when I started reading this manga, that it would just slather me in information about Schrodinger's Cat. I was so pleasantly surprised as they took their time and went into this interesting subject matter and my brain was going \"wow this manga sure is interesting and GOOD if you have at least a basic understanding of quantum physics and metaphysics and SCIENCE THINGS.\"\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/OfGzuPf.png)\n\nBut then I had another thought... _fucking what?_ Where did the plot go? What was this chapter? Why are you going on about Schrodinger's Cat? What is the point of this manga? Why are you doing this to me? Why are you performing this assault on my mental FACULTIES?\n\n___\n\n#R-28: YUKARI IS A FUCKING SIDE CHARACTER\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/VBQpHK9.png)\n\nHey, guess what? HEY, GUESS WHAT?\n\nQUALIA THE PURPLE? THE CHARACTER WITH THE PURPLE EYES WHO SEES EVERYONE AS ROBOTS? You might be thinking, that character has to be pretty important to the entire manga. Right? You would think that, right? I thought that. I truly did think that. Everybody is just treating Yukari like she's perfectly normal other than the main character. No, _actually_, not only do people not think she's _fucking crazy_, BUT THAT HER \"ABILITY\" IS LEGIT OR HAS AN ACTUAL VALUE IN SOCIETY.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/C4OCcfJ.png)\n\nLike the police come and visit her and go \"oh yeah you see there's this fucking serial killer on the loose and we know how you can see everybody's robot bodies that are hidden to the normal NON PURPLE eye so yeah if you could help us with our case we would appreciate it\" and like there's this super special school that's actually run by this manipulative evil worldwide group that goes \"oh we need the girl who claims that everybody is robots.\"\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/CxUbnRR.png)\n\nBeyond the first part of the manga when you're still thinking the manga is about her, she basically almost entirely and completely fucking disappears. GONE. Like she's still in the manga and she is literally the entire motivation behind everything the main character does but...\n\nWhy not... why not just calm down, and do a manga about this girl who sees everybody as robots? \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/OLyeroX.png)\n\nWhy does... why does the manga just completely shift, and all that shit about the robots and serial killer it just... it just completely falls to the wayside? Like it becomes about the main character's descent into... I can't describe the actual main plot of this manga as anything other than actual literal complete insanity.\n\nBy the point where Yukari did return to importance I was just...\n\n\"Oh. Oh yeah, she's the one with the purple eyes and sees everybody and everything else as robots? Wow, how fucking mundane is that compared to all of the other shit I just experienced.\"\n\n___\n\n#R-28: GAKU BECOMES GOD BECAUSE SHE BELIEVES#\n\nThe main character on the other hand... I hate her. I hate her with every fiber of my being.\n\nThe way she meets Ms. \"You Are a Robot\" is she kiss collides with her in the hallway as Ms. \"You Are a Robot\" chases her down to confirm her true gender. But that's not important. None of that is important.\n\nWhat is important is that later on in the manga after she has her arm cut off and then rebuilt by Yukari and becomes capable of using her hand as a means to communicate with Yukari and alternate versions of herself in parallel and alternate universes, she BECOMES GOD. SHE BECOMES CAPABLE OF ALL SORTS OF SHIT BECAUSE FUCK IT. YOU REMEMBER THAT CHAPTER WHERE THEY EXPLAIN SCHRODINGER'S CAT? MAYBE THERE'S AN EXPLANATION SOMEWHERE IN THERE.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/XBcS5Uh.png)\n\nShe's... she's a high school student! I know she had her arm cut off in a scrape she had with a serial killer and then rebuilt but with the added functunality of a cell phone capable of calling alternate universes, but WHEN DID SHE GAIN THE INTELLIGENCE OR THE ABILITY TO... JUMP UNIVERSES? OR BASICALLY JUST TIME TRAVEL? Like she just goes, \"oh I messed up in this universe, better try another one\" over and over and over again.\n\nAnd eventually, and EVENTUALLY, SHE BECOMES GOD. SHE BECOMES ONE WITH EVERYTHING, IN HER PURSUIT TO SAVE HER FRIEND. \"FUCK YOU FATE, I'LL BECOME GOD BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN SCIENCE AND METAPHYSICS AND ALTERNATE UNIVERSES AND SCHRODINGER'S DOG AND I WILL BECOME GOD TO SAVE MY BEST FRIEND WHO I MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE ROMANCE FEELINGS TOWARDS BECAUSE FUCK IT THIS MAY AS WELL AS BE IN THE YURI GENRE AS WELL.\"\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/uvckWZw.png)\n\nBut then, you look a bit closer, and yeah. This manga, is an adaptation, of a novel. So to be fair, maybe all of the metaphysics and the alternate universes are went further into in the novel. But even in a novel form, I could not picture the emotional and plot leaps this manga takes.\n\nThey're just ordinary high schoolers at the start. I would have never expected one of them would effectively become God, and then become not God again.\n\n___\n\n#R-28: THE SERIAL KILLER WAS THE ONLY GOOD PART#\n_Even then, it's still batshit weird._\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/1S4mALy.png)\n\nOkay, what if I told you there was one moment in the manga when I thought this was amazing? That everything else could be forgiven because of how genius this one singular moment was? It was just so fucking weird and out of left field that it actually briefly managed to get me on the manga's side. There just happens to be a serial killer and they target one of the two main characters, and then robot girl comes to the rescue with...\n\nWith an army of toy robots that then proceeds to DISMANTLE the serial killer. Her head is detached along with every other limb and she's still alive and talking and freaking the fuck out because this girl literally just took her apart.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/1E9DvA1.png)\n\nThis part was just so weird but the correct type of weird that I was temporarily on board with the manga and thought it was going to lead into a great direction. Instead, it completely flips around and starts heading in a different path, and literally the only significance that the first section of the manga has is that Yukari rebuilds Gaku's missing arm into an interdimensional quantum cell phone.\n\nThe army of toy robots, the serial killer, fucking Yukari's ability to rebuild or dismantle human flesh robots... yeah, that's all done and over with. It's time to fucking get into alternate dimensions and Gaku talking to other versions of herself through her HAND.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/mrGLsDv.png)\n___\n\n#R-28: Is there an alternate universe where this is good? And where Gaku has a clear and consistent character?#\n\nYou might be thinking this review seems a bit scrambled or rushed. Or, that this is one huge fabrication and I'm just making all this shit up. I assure you, padded room aside, I'm not.  \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/cO7hJWY.png)\n\nThis is a real manga. This is a real series someone created. After the serial killer is wrapped up, a pompous new girl comes to Gaku and Yukari's school and is aware of Yukari's gift and wishes to recruit and bring her back to a weird special school where her gift can be put to better use.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/rImhcFj.png)\n\nGaku is supportive of Yukari and advises her to go if she wants, and then the fucking story just trips the fuck out and it turns out the special school is in fact an evil society that wishes to run tests on Yukari for her gift and use her, but GOOD NEWS.\n\nGAKU CAN USE HER INTERDIMENSIONAL CELL PHONE WHICH IS ALSO HER HAND TO TALK TO ALTERNATE VERSIONS OF HERSELF FROM ALTERNATE UNIVERSES AND SHE DISCOVERS HOW TO BECOME THOSE VERSIONS OF HERSELF, SO SHE ENTERS A REPEATING CYCLE OF ATTEMPTING TO STOP THIS EVENT FROM HAPPENING TO SAVE YUKARI.\n\nEven if she stops Yukari from going to the school, SHE ENDS UP DYING OR GETTING KILLED OR BEING TAKEN THERE ANYWAYS. Basically, Yukari, whom you would think is the poster character for this manga more or less just fucking disappears from the manga entirely as all this shit is going on. And Gaku, just fucking...\n\nOkay, first of all, I don't care how much quantum physics and science jargon you spew at me, Schrodinger's Cat this, Schrodinger's Cat that, YOU CAN'T JUST... SHE'S TALKING THROUGH HER HAND TO ALTERNATE VERSIONS OF HERSELF IN ALTERNATE UNIVERSES. There's... THERE'S NO RATIONALIZING OR MAKING THIS SEEM SENSIBLE OR NOT CRAZY.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/D2P0wJy.png)\n\nGaku and Yukari, it's not like their lifelong best friends. Or... even if you view this as a yuri, like the sole reason the two met was because Yukari wasn't certain of Gaku's gender and they kiss collided in the hallway. In actual reality if after this happened, the person told you that they see everyone as robots, you would distance yourself from that person as much as possible because they are _fucking insane_ and you literally __JUST__ met them.\n\nBut no, Gaku just fucking snaps and her character sprouts wings and flies far beyond the boundaries of logical and sensible characters. She decides that no matter what, as a HIGH SCHOOL GIRL, SHE'S GOING TO DEFY FATE ITSELF TO ENSURE YUKARI'S SAFETY, __EVEN IF SHE HAS TO BECOME ONE WITH THE UNIVERSE AND ASCEND TO GODHOOD ITSELF TO MAKE SURE IT HAPPENS.__\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/Xlwy3dx.png)\n\nMeanwhile, I'm just sitting here, internally screaming out of agony, as my brain tries to process anything that is happening and FAILS TO DO SO. Because I just didn't understand... why... and how. Up to this point I will argue that I don't think we saw anything to inspire any sort of belief that Gaku would have any reason to go THAT far. \n\nLook, Yukari is insane and rebuilt Gaku's arm into a cell phone. She didn't have to rebuild it to also have the function as a interdimensional cell phone? Why did she do that? Your best friend genuinely believes that you're just a walking soulless automaton and you just go... oh... okay, I guess? Then immediately right after that, you tell them the following: \n\n__IF YOU ARE EVER IN ANY SORT OF MORTAL AND TERRIBLE DANGER, I WILL ENTER AN INFINITE TIME LOOP IN AN ATTEMPT TO REWRITE THE UNIVERSE SO YOU CAN IN FACT LIVE EVEN IF I MUST BECOME SOME WEIRD GODLIKE DEITY AFTER OVERCOMING THE SCIENTIFIC BOUNDARIES OF THIS UNIVERSE.__\n\nI'm sorry, I'm just not gonna extend that type of offer to the girl who thinks I'm a goddamned robot.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/TWjl8m2.png)\n\nAlso, can I just say eventually I so turned against Gaku as a character that I was reveling in and hoping that she would fail and Yukari would remain dead. Let me justify this real quick, Gaku straight up outright admits that she stops being herself and just fucking snaps in the manga itself but. Like, she fucking starts manipulating, killing, and emotionally torturing the other characters and this includes HERSELF, ALICE, AS WELL AS __EVEN YUKARI__. Like she becomes Yukari's mother and then like locks her up in their house so nobody ever finds out about her eyes and she's like this fucking withdrawn asocial feral child and...\n\nLike the final \"Gaku\", the one that ends up being the \"successful\" one that ends up mattering, literally takes over the vague evil science society and becomes a weird manipulative messiah being. And she's just like... \"oh, I won the NOBEL PRIZE, I traveled the globe doing GOD'S WORK because I am the MESSIAH.\"\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/b0TKU2x.png)\n\nI'm genuinely not sure I've ever hated a character more than I did Gaku. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/Rz51TQy.png)\n\n\"I CAN DO ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING AS LONG AS I'M OPEN TO THE IDEA THAT PARALLEL WORLDS EXIST. I AM CAPABLE OF SAVING THE ENTIRE WORLD AND UNDOING EVERYBODY ELSE'S DEATH BUT NOT MY BEST FRIEND, YUKARI. AND YUKARI IS THE ONLY ONE THAT MATTERS, __THE ENTIRE WORLD CAN BURN FOR ALL I CARE.\"__\n\nThe Gaku is immortal. Did you hear me? Did you hear the words I said??\n\n#THE GAKU IS IMMORTAL.#\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/qJQtQH3.png)\n\n___\n\n#R-28: WHERE IS THE PLOT, SCHRODINGER#\n_Is there a plot in the box or is it not in the box? Is the plot alive or is it fucking dead?_\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/GRzPHDf.png)\n\nI've already mentioned this but I sort of want to underline it, there is an entire chapter where Gaku talks to the totally important and relevant other girl character who is completely normal and therefore actually distanced herself from Yukari after learning about her gift, and they just go on and on the entire chapter about Schrodinger's goddamned Cat.\n\nWhat the ever living fuck was the purpose of that chapter? What the fuck was the purpose of this entire MANGA? \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/larL27Q.png)\n\nBecause at the end, after Gaku becomes God, she gets talked down and decides not to be God anymore and reverts everything back to normal again, but then smashes her hand against a window and then has the interdimensional cellphone disabled or removed from her hand.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/2x59Uy8.png)\n\n...And, she basically begins to forget all of the dimension hopping she did and all of the different lives she lived...? So basically Yukari is still possibly gonna die in the future and everything she did had absolutely no fucking purpose and we're not even shown one way or the other if Yukari's bullshit gift was legitimate in any way shape or form.\n\n...Now that I think about it, who cares even if Yukari actually was the only human or if Gaku was a robot? GAKU COULD FUCKING HOP DIMENSIONS AND VERY EASILY ASCENDED TO GODHOOD. WHAT DID YUKARI DO/ACCOMPLISH, EXACTLY?\n\n...Actually, now that I think about it, Gaku wouldn't have been able to ascend to godhood without the interdimensional hand cellphone she gave to Yukari in the first place... but... wait? Okay, hold ON. We need a chart. We need a chart for this to work out the progression of the plot of this manga.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/3c05M1Y.png)\n\n_Wow, that was fucked up. Creating that took actually more time than writing any of this review up to this point._\n\nSo okay yeah, none of it mattered. Literally none of it mattered. As a matter of fact, the manga itself throws the word \"dream\" out there fully on its own accord which...\n\nYou should never voluntarily go for a \"dream\" ending. It was all a dream...! None of it actually mattered at all in the end...! \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/QiNSf4H.png)\n\nThat part where Gaku goes back and becomes her child self and then creates magic so she can become a magical girl happens and then the manga is just like well that happened also let's move on now and...\n\n...Wait, did I even talk about the magical girl chapter yet???\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/NsK8Azw.png)\n\n\"Try having your whole body repaired with jungle gym parts.\" This... this is a sentence in the chapter... where they try to explain Yukari's gift with science and... like why, why even try to explain it at all? That's the most baffling thing to me still. You can't, so just don't... at all... _please._\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/sJPo1Hf.png)\n\n_Yeah, a nightmarish world where a serial killer chops your arm off and then a purple eyed girl proceeds to slay her with an army of toy robots, then gives you a cell phone hand which leads you into becoming essentially GOD. BUT NO, THIS ISN'T SCIENCE FICTION. THIS IS REAL. THIS IS SERIOUS._\n___\n\n#R-28: Miscellaneous Points that Caused Me Agony#\n\nWhen Gaku becomes deity Gaku and Yukari is alive again and is talking to deity Gaku, there is a point where Yukari...\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/StqBoFm.png)\n\nIs... is she saying she sees the goddamned text boxes of the manga with Gaku's dialogue in it? Her eyes directly looking towards the text box and her hand is directly positioned underneath of it so what else is... happening there?\n\nAlso, Gaku straight up kills herself. More than once throughout the manga. Just outright... like one version of herself slips back into sanity and starts talking sense, and then another version of her comes up and blows her brains out.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/hSiqfbF.png)\n\nShe even tells herself through her interdimensional quantum cell phone to kill herself after another version of herself admits to her that she's falling in love with the poor girl who was a pawn that she herself was now using as a pawn as a means to an end. Additionally, that she possibly felt romantic feelings towards her other friends in the past as well.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/ME3TLXx.png)\n\nThen finally, finally, there was the point of the manga that caused my brain to just completely shut down. I read this manga in one day and I went through a VERY wide range of emotions. I could not BELIEVE that this would get even WEIRDER after the parallel world Schrodinger's FUCK was introduced.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/i6jrMhG.png)~~~ \n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/6S4Pupt.png)~~~\n\nAll of this weird shit and it leads to, okay, let's undo it all, it basically was just nothing but a dream.\n\n. . .\n\nimg220(https://i.imgur.com/RTFdupU.png)\n\n___\n\n#R-28: Conclusion#\n\n...There's no winning with this one. The original act of reading through this genuinely felt like an all out attack on my senses and my brain itself. But the manga itself provided me a warning and I discarded it and pushed on, because I am incredibly dumb. I give this like a __2.5 out of 10__ or a __25 out of 100__, but I can't actively not recommend this at all. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/aAJlS7x.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/OvOaIdu.png)\n\nBecause... if you're into really weird and insane shit, this series is definitely... it definitely fits the bill. I mean, I hated, HATE, this series, but I was never bored through it. Even when it was dumping __MAD SCHRODINGERS__ on my head, I was just baffled and trying to comprehend anything.\n\nNow, can somebody please let me out of this fucking padded room? The review is done.

It received [an anime in 2003](https://anilist.co/anime/486/KinonoTabiTheBeautifulWorld) but for several reasons, I am not going to base this review heavily off of comparisons to the original anime. \n\nDon't get me wrong, there'll still be a separate section for that, but I want to stress that the several problems I have with this show go beyond... the remake episodes.\n\nAdditionally, with the new anime, it received two separate new manga adaptations, both by different artists. [One](https://anilist.co/manga/98489/KinonoTabiTheBeautifulWorld) follows the original novel's order of stories (with a small bit of tweaking that puts the earliest chronological story first), and the [other](https://anilist.co/manga/100466/KinonoTabitheBeautifulWorldGou) adapts random chapters. The new anime takes the latter approach, picking and choosing random bits and pieces throughout the 20+ volumes of Kino no Tabi. I'm going to go into why or how the order of stories matter later, but I genuinely believe there is merit in both approaches.\n\nAlthough, the reason why we have not received an English translation of the novels beyond volume 1 is because the English translation changed not only several things within the actual writing, but also changed the order of the stories within volume 1, putting the chronologically earliest chapter first.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/zEfItXk.png)\n\n\"Due to issues with the licensor, the remaining volumes have been canceled.\"\n\nHow unfortunate. This brings us to this new anime by [Lerche](https://anilist.co/studio/456/Lerche) (creators of [Ranpo Kitan](https://anilist.co/anime/21189/RanpoKitanGameofLaplace)) a mere fourteen years after the original anime aired in 2003. The original Kino is in fact, one of the handful of shows I first watched when JUST getting into anime.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/zbgOJmR.png)\n\n...So it's safe to say, I was reasonably excited when I learned that \"Kino 2017\" was gonna be a thing. And... just let me tell you right now. Nine times out of ten, going into a remake or a new \"entry\" of the thing as a fan of the original ends up leading to disaster. Because the more you liked the original, the more you're gonna want the new version to be good.\n\nBut if that new version isn't good, hell, if it doesn't even live up to the original... it's all gonna fall down and eventually, you're gonna just start pretending that it never existed in the first place.\n\nGranted, there are exceptions... some avoid falling flat on their face... but MOST of the time...\n\n~~~img220(https://img.fireden.net/a/image/1467/46/1467465002260.gif)~~~\n\n~~~__Oh yeah, I'm gonna be going into detail on numerous of the episodes so uh... I'll just declare SPOILERS right now, I guess. For the actual new episodes, I mean. Obviously, I'm not going to care about spoiling the remake episodes since it's been fourteen years since the origin__~~~\n___\n\n#K-2: Looks Like Kino, Sounds Like Kino... Seems... Like Kino?#\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/m6ni8eW.png)\n\nDespite the impression I may be giving off, I truly did not immediately turn on this. As a matter of fact, I was enjoying it quite a bit. I'd have some questions pop up in my head about some of the episodes here and there, but there was nothing too major early on. The animation looks good, Kino looks and sounds like Kino, and I could clearly see at least some of that tone of Kino no Tabi.\n\n\"I heard about a country where apparently, killing is legal. Let's go visit it. I'm sure there'll be no twist to this country at all.\"\n\nLike Kino running into someone and talking with them on the way to this country who was heading there both on the way to the country and in the process of leaving the country that both had very different reasons for heading to this country where apparently killing is allowed, felt very Kino no Tabi.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/HyyS7VH.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/XER7U1I.png)~~~\n\nTo clarify, this was the very first episode and to be quite honest, I believe the peak of the entire show. Everything is downhill from here on out. I was of course completely unaware of this, and was additionally unaware that there was going to be an episode so horribly stupid that a hand would reach out from my computer monitor and then proceed to bitch slap the scales off of my eyes.\n\nIt could be argued that that episode is the true start of the downhill slope of Kino 2017, but after I grew negative due to the later episodes, I started thinking about the earlier episodes and how I have a lot of problems with them. But yet, episode one still... actually works. Nothing glaring jumps out at me. I'm still capable of saying, yeah, this is Kino no Tabi.\n\nimg440(https://media.giphy.com/media/l378koid9pRgKX2G4/giphy.gif)\n\nSo what... what went wrong in the following episodes, then?\n\n___\n\n#K-2: Who is Kino?#\n\nI have no idea who Kino is in Kino 2017. She's a traveler who goes from country to country on her motorrad named Hermes... I got that, but not much else from this version of Kino. I didn't know why she did the things she did, and... I could probably count on one hand the times I was capable of telling what emotion the character was having throughout this entire series.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/3nDrYaY.png)\n\nOn one hand, you think she's just a traveler who wishes to stick to herself and not get into any conflicts within the countries she visits. But then, there are several times where she does something that clearly contradicts this. Which would be fine if we knew more about her as a character or why she was doing the things she did.\n\nThe coliseum episode, we're vaguely shown or can guess the reasons why she did what she did. That one was... mostly fine, but I'll go into it more when I start specifically discussing the episodes that are \"remakes.\"\n\nIt starts really with the third episode... or rather, when I actually stopped and thought about it after my opinion of this show began to landslide in the negative later on, I realized nothing about what Kino does in the third episodes makes any sense at all. She boards a gigantic moving machine which is in fact a country that is constantly on the move and while she's there, the path of the moving country ends up leading through a different country down on the ground.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/2XvSDnA.png)\n\nThe moving country is prepared to literally crush this other country that was completely minding its own business up to this point (granted, yes, they put up a wall, which does inconvenience travelers attempting to pass through this area) and Kino is on board the moving country to witness this. Kino does not at any point try to dissuade the people of the moving country to either stop or perhaps just simply change paths. Perhaps I'm just mistaken here, but I genuinely recall her not even asking or bringing up the idea of them just changing their path.\n\nNo, what she decides to contribute to this situation is... once the country on the ground realizes they are completely helpless to this technological behemoth that wishes to crush its way through its country to the lands beyond, the soldiers get pissed and for some reason start... specifically aiming their weapons at... the murals of the moving country that the children made. Kino steps forth and basically squashes the petty resistance by shooting her gun at their targeting systems in a pointless and needlessly showy action scene.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/2KO9xzb.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/YzBISZc.png)~~~\n\n...Why, exactly? Okay yes, I get it, the lasers of the moving country are super deadly and, they were genuinely considering obliterating the entire land country because they were attacking the goddamned murals. But... BUT...\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/LWVvS4e.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/guxjqHn.png)~~~\n\nTHEY HAD ALREADY TRAMPLED OVER THE COUNTRY'S FIELDS. THEIR FOOD SOURCE, GONE, DESTROYED, THEIR WALL IS GONE SO THERE GOES THEIR SECURITY, AND LET'S NOT EVEN GO INTO HOW TRAUMATIZING THIS EVENT HAD TO HAVE BEEN FOR EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/GC1cF3j.png)\n\n\"Gosh, I sure hope another moving country doesn't come through and blast us with gigantic death lasers! Gosh, I sure am glad they didn't just outright destroy us but rather let us starve to death after destroying our crops!\"\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/jyTgA9z.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/AaY2Ip0.png)~~~\n\nKino is witnessing these events firsthand and she just... no emotion, whatsoever. Just a goddamned BLANK SLATE. She just outright tries to ignore the genuine rage and hatred the general of the other country is venting. After all, she doesn't want to get on the bad side of the moving country, they'll kill her WITH LASERS. You know what... let me just check right now.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/KvwxvxF.png)\n\nOkay, this country is from the seventh volume of Kino no Tabi. Meaning, there isn't such a gigantic and absurd leap... like seven volumes in, and Kino obviously has gone through some serious shit in a bunch of other countries that the reader has experienced throughout the past novels. In this anime, this is the third episode, and the second episode was about the coliseum country (which is from the very first volume) where Kino outright puts herself into the middle of the country's problem and DIRECTLY changes the country entirely.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/ZkKW4vu.png)\n\nWe go from that to... to this. Within the span of a single episode.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/edbJekj.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/2p7MahM.png)~~~\n\n\"Shh, Hermes. They'll finish their war after they finish devastating this country, then we'll be on our way.\" \n\nHow am I supposed to like this character if I'm not even capable of making heads or tails of her? Also it's even worse if you've watched the original in which Kino is actually even more active in doing things, so you're absolutely flabbergasted when she just decides to watch this war play out before her.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/Lyo9QdM.png)\n\nThen there's episode four which is primarily focused on Shizu's (don't worry I'll get to him too) experience in a country. Basically he's told that during his stay, he can either go toil with the commoners of the country or lounge around in luxury overseeing the filthy commoners. Shizu, being a good guy, decides to go hang out with the commoners. It's revealed later in the episode that another traveler shows after Shizu and what do you know, it's Kino, and she chose to... lounge around and oversee the commoners? Shizu eventually tries to lead a rebellion to help out the commoners, and Kino is sent to actively try and stop him.\n\n...Which she appears to genuinely attempt to do, and only doesn't when the ruling group of the country turn on her after noticing that she seems to have a previous relation to Shizu who is basically leading this rebellion. \n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/eXXBSST.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/JWMv30G.png)~~~\n\nKino, what the FUCK. Choosing to lounge around overseeing the commoners aside because I guess maybe she was probably being less cruel than the past travelers who chose that option, why was she actually trying to stop Shizu?\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/buGij3E.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/ZCRblFZ.png)~~~\n\nEven after Kino shows her face after they \"kind of fight\", Kino still asks Shizu to stop his attempted rebellion and just go back. It's like the second after this when the ruling group turns on her, and then she basically just decides \"oh well, I guess my eggs are in the Shizu's rebellion basket now.\"\n\nKino is supposed to be the protagonist, the series is KINO'S JOURNEY, but from what has been offered, Shizu is so much more likable than Kino edition 2017. Honestly, I actually kind of hate her. I don't know if it's the fact that she's a seemingly emotionless robot or the episode order, which I'm getting to, but...\n\nProbably the most baffling thing to me about Kino 2017 as a whole is that Kino herself was just infuriating to me. Which leads me to the next point...\n\n___\n\n#K-2: There is a surprising lack of Kino in Kino 2017.#\n\nYou know what's even worse than Kino being unlikable? Kino not showing up at all or mattering very little throughout entire episodes. I'm not even making a joke when I say I would have loved this show if Kino had been cut out of it entirely and it had just been Shizu no Tabi. Shizu's wandering the world and throughout all these countries in an attempt to find a new place to life, an actual goal and... actually tries to help out the people in the countries he visits when he can.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/FNgO5WY.png)\n\nHe's actually on a journey with a purpose. Kino, on the other hand... \"let's go watch and participate in a war!\"\n\nBut this section isn't even about the Shizu episodes. Let's talk about episode six, my personal turning point with this show. After at least mildly enjoying the show thus far, episode six just... it's when everything just crumbled. Every episode after that was just awful, and there was the realization that they were doing two more \"remake\" episodes and they possibly picked the absolute worst locations for those episodes.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/vKyqJQt.png)\n\nBut let's calm down and tackle one thing at a time. Episode six does not focus on Kino or Shizu. It focuses on a random completely unknown slave girl in a completely unknown country. Basically, she was from a religious country who ended up having to sell her off to a group of traders... and the group of traders seems like an ordinary group of upstanding citizens for the most part.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/FTO6U71.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/fRiMko5.png)~~~\n\nExcluding the fact that they apparently have no qualms with slavery, and not only slavery, but being absolutely fucking malicious to their newly gained slave girl. \"You're okay with being sold as a slave by your own people? Wow, you're fucking worthless. You absolutely have no worth and are a fucking drain on our resources, why did we even accept you.\"\n\n...Just... just keep this important fact in mind. She is a local to the land they're in, basically. She possesses knowledge about the land they are in and about you know plants and whatnot. Potentially useful information. That's not super important, but just keep it in mind for now.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/C7yO7GN.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/IqAclTl.png)~~~\n\nBasically one of the girls of this merchant group finds a group of super tasty looking herbs, which they decide to harvest and use for their meal. The slave girl realizes they're in the process of making a horrible mistake and tries to do the right thing and warn them, but she's incapable of bringing herself to yell loud enough for them to hear. They eat the poison soup.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/piupORN.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/LV5j3u1.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/bghSh1G.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/GJHyQaa.png)~~~\n\nSo the girl's basically like, okay, fuck it then. I'll just eat my bowl and die along the side of these horrible people. But then this kid just fucking launches a stone to knock her bowl of poison soup out of her hands because he noticed she wasn't going to use a spoon and simply DOWN the entire bowl of POISON in one go. This act intended to be cruel ends up denying the girl the horribly painful death she wanted at that moment.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/UevbxAH.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/nT23Tzf.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/aBJn8DN.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/sS1P6RB.png)~~~\n\nFinally, she manages to tell them about the poison herbs, but this results in having more stones thrown at her to get her to shut up. When she comes to, the blond boy who knocked her bowl out of her hand is in the middle of negotiations with his father to buy the slave girl. \n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/JvK08TD.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/vDYIe98.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/bRCon5S.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/wzGmiCi.png)~~~\n\n...The kid, of this totally normal and upstanding merchant group, suddenly launches off into this whole fucking crazy tirade of how he REALLY wants to brutally torture and murder this poor abused girl. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/6WbjHpn.png)\n\nAnd the adults are all like YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT KID. WE SHOULD TOTALLY FUCKING BRUTALLY MURDER THIS POOR GIRL WE ACCEPTED AS A SLAVE BECAUSE SHE TRIED TO WARN US OF ALL OF OUR IMPENDING DEATHS. What? Why? Why accept a slave as payment and then basically just discard that extra slave labor because one of your psychotic kids suddenly descended into a ravenous bloodlust? Aren't you supposed to be merchants??? I swear to God with this episode, I almost felt like I went back in time and was watching Ranpo Kitan again while locked within a horrible struggle as my brain tried to understand what was happening or why it was happening.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/OZiev1P.png)\n\nThe girl just fucking fully snaps in this moment and admittedly, does this actually cool screaming moment because yes, I can empathize with this character. I'm surprised she hadn't fucking snapped earlier, jesus christ. Of course, everybody who ate the poison soup starts to die right after she screams.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/D6iAaSO.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/NhxJdqw.png)~~~\n\nThen, as she's left alone and surrounded by corpses wishing she could have died too, it turns out one of the merchants survived and claims that he'd help the girl end her own life. In actuality, the gun only has one bullet (???), so he tricks the girl into using it on him so only he gets to escape this horrible HORRIBLE world. Thankfully though, she finds a nearby motorrad who proceeds to tell her the true way to die.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/U805NVH.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/5gsNmCt.png)~~~\n\nBy... by living. Oh. Well yeah, you'll definitely die eventually if you do that! You're thinking to yourself \"oh, is she going to be a recurring character like Shizu?\" because that would explain the purpose of this episode and character. Unfortunately, it turns out that nope, this episode contains a conclusion to this slave girl's story therefore meaning she's never going to appear ever again. She goes on to live out her life, becoming a talented photographer, who is eventually called... drumroll please...\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/EOhE82l.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/EOhE82l.png)~~~\n\nPhoto. Her name becomes Photo. As in photo in photograph because she is a photographer. That is what becomes her name. No, that's fine. Hey, your occupation is baking donuts? Well, your name is now Donut. That makes sense. That makes __PERFECT SENSE__. \n\nOh yeah, and... after all of that, at the end of the episode, Kino and Hermes do show back up and Kino looks through her binoculars at all the corpses from the preceding events because... it's Kino no Tabi after all. Kino is definitely an important character of the series, haha... ha...\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/4CLkIB4.png)\n\n...She may as well as not have shown up at all. Granted yes, she does in the novel's version of the story as well but... ugh. That chapter probably works as its own thing within whatever volume of Kino no Tabi that is. But the thing is if you're doing a new anime and you're picking stories from all these different volumes from over the years, wouldn't you want to do stories that primarily feature Kino? Or if not even that, then just interesting and good stories. It would only make sense to do the best ones.\n\nWhy choose to devote an entire episode of a twelve episode series to a side character we don't know and aren't invested in, whose story is entirely concluded within the episode, therefore meaning her importance probably doesn't go beyond that singular story? \n\n___Revising TGG___: _\"Wait, wait, wait. Photo [apparently is actually a recurring character in the novels](http://kinosjourney.wikia.com/wiki/Photo/Chapters) SHE JUST DOESN'T SHOW UP EVER AGAIN IN THIS FUCKING ADAPTATION WHY INTRODUCE HER THEN IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO AT LEAST ONE OTHER STORY THAT'S CENTERED ON PHOTO. WITH SOU'S LITTLE SPEECH AS THE CREDITS ROLL, I FUCKING REALLY THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS JUST SHOWING HOW SHE ENDED UP BUT NO, IN THE NOVELS APPARENTLY SHE COMES BACK. MAYBE IF THIS GETS ANOTHER SEASON, THEN THEY'LL DO HER CHAPTERS. OR MAYBE THEY'LL INTRODUCE MORE CHARACTERS THEY THEN DON'T USE AND THEN ARE COMPLETELY POINTL--\"_\n\nIf Kino had interacted with her or the group of merchants in any way, then that would have changed things. But she didn't even see any of the events of the episode. She just saw the corpses, threw out some Kino and Hermes dialogue out there because it was required as this is a Kino no Tabi episode, and then it was over. Her role in the episode was concluded.\n\nI can't get over it. She's an emotionless husk. I had more reason to care about this pointless side character slave girl than Kino, who you would think would be the heart of this series.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/qlWoml2.png)\n\nBut hey, since we're on the subject of Kino regurgitating dialogue, I really liked the episode about Kino's Master (whom they didn't bother to introduce beyond a weird bad two second scene) that they made primarily be in sepia tone because the episode is about the past and everybody knows if you're gonna show anything from the past, you gotta go full sepia tone otherwise the viewer won't understand it's in the past.\n\nThe episode is mostly about the shenanigans the Master would get into with her partner when she was younger, and how they essentially overthrew a country's tyrannical ruling class by setting all the trash cans in a country on fire and then refusing to leave the country's tower when asked. But like there could have probably been a whole action scene between the Master busting her partner out of prison and them getting into the tower, but the episode just transitions back to Kino.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/1qeGTU7.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/ubLchfJ.png)~~~\n\n...Kino suddenly just takes over the episode and explains what her Master and her partner in crime did rather than the show actually just... show it. How'd they make it from the prison to the top of the tower? Nah, that'd be too interesting to see actually happen. Just have Kino drone on about it to Hermes as she's taking care of her campfire. Rather than Kino doing interesting things, we get to hear Kino just drone on about other people doing potentially interesting things.\n\nWonderful. That was certainly my favorite part about Kino no Tabi. Oh, and remember the country where Kino had a great time and experience being in the country, but the country forces travelers to have their memories of their time in the countries to be erased so the anime equivalent of this is we just immediately cut to Kino leaving the country right after entering it?\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/XARFc4x.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/jrbfons.png)~~~\n\nThat was my favorite country of them all! I really wonder what made them choose to animate that country specifically!\n\n_Dude, it's basically a \"free\" country. We don't have to animate SHIT for this one._\n____\n\n#K-2: The Importance of Episode Order#  \n\nLook, the whole thing of Kino no Tabi is that the countries are all... there's mostly no chronological order. Or rather, apart from a handful of exceptions, there's no real order among the sequence of countries Kino visits. But that doesn't mean the episode order doesn't matter at all. Especially if you're going to pick and choose a bunch of different stories from the seventeen years plus of Kino no Tabi.\n\nThe original anime didn't exactly have that option, so it stuck with stories from the first couple of volumes. There wasn't any more of a meaning to the sequence of countries in the original than there is in the 2017 version. But also, you didn't go from a story from volume 1 to a story from volume 20 in a one episode span. As far as I'm aware, the farthest the 2003 anime goes is a story from like volume 6.\n\nIt's probably safe to say that a story from the beginning of a series compared to one twenty volumes later is going to be different in tone and ideas. If you adapt them faithfully word for word and then just slap them next to each other, it's gonna come off as fucking bizarre when you do the episode detailing Kino's backstory and how she became a traveler and then an episode when she gets into a violent and horrific war with an army of violent rabid sheep.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/2qSMTNU.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/ahKWKIo.png)~~~\n\nJust on a brief tangent here, Kino 2003 worked so well because of the countries and the stories they did. The 2003 version of Kino went through some shit and was an actual character and actually did things, and actually went through interesting and sometimes horrible or even outright ruined countries, leading up to the final country she visits which she personally hears is outright horrible to travelers, but when it turns out to be the direct opposite, she actually wishes to stay longer which actually has weight in the 2003 version because we've seen the sort of shit she had to go through.\n\nBut as it turns out, she's forced to leave, and the final note that Kino 2003 goes on is that she moves on and keeps traveling. It was such an effective final episode. Oh, I should also note, that we get to see Kino's backstory in like episode 4 of the 2003 version so watchers of the 2003 version actually got to learn who she is and why she's traveling.\n\n...So let's finally get to it. How does Kino 2017 order these things?\n\nEpisode 10: The finale episode from 2003.\nEpisode 11: Kino's Backstory.\nEpisode 12 (THE FINALE): Kino battles sheep, lays on a hammock, and has a dialogue with Hermes lazily explaining that her \"JOURNEY\" will continue on \"POSSIBLY\" (if they get another season) but if it doesn't she'll just be \"NAPPING\".\n\n...Why. Why save the episode of Kino's backstory for almost the very end when it's in volume 1 of the novel series and it was like episode 4 of the 2003 anime? It becomes even more baffling since the finale episode from 2003 has a character that is sort of a reflection of younger Kino but people who haven't watched the 2003 anime or read the novels won't get that. Additionally, why redo this episode at all if you're not going to end on it like the 2003 anime did? I understand that the sheep story is from one of the most recent volumes of Kino no Tabi and they probably wanted to end on a story from one of the recent volumes but... was that the really best one they could have chosen?\n\nRather than going out on an emotionally impactful note like the 2003 anime, 2017 goes out on perhaps one of the most schlocky episodes I've seen in quite a great deal of time. Kino gunning down CG sheep, setting an entire meadow on fire, and they even use slow motion!\n\nI really find it fucking bizarre that of all of these episodes, [I honestly enjoyed watching this one the most](https://anilist.co/activity/9977582). And not solely because it was comically horrible but because Kino was actually finally doing something. Actually...\n\n___\n\n#K-2: No, We're Not Skimming Over This#\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/0tUH9Da.png)\n\nI don't wish to reiterate anything I already said in that status post about this episode, but I cannot move past it.\n\nThe sheep episode is not Lerche doing something weird or awful that goes against Kino no Tabi. No, this story actually is from the novels. Granted, it's from one of the newest volumes, so obviously the story has not been translated so I can't actively compare this episode to the original story but... I just can't help but wonder about it.\n\nAfter twenty volumes, has the author just completely ran out of ideas? Like the episode did not make this seem like some joke country at all with Kino encountering the skeleton of a man who killed himself after realizing his leg was broken and he was trapped in this sheep hell, and the implication is VERY MUCH that he killed himself because of this.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/g1cB6fV.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/V80OdA3.png)~~~\n\nLike when Kino finally seriously starts her war against the sheep, she straight up outright says: \"This is for that man.\" Who...? The unnamed skeleton? So Kino who... watched on as another country destroyed the entire food supply of another country completely unphased... is now... claiming vengeance on sheep for an unnamed skeleton she found. What?\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/QFWLyIk.png)\n\nAdditionally, there is straight up a \"leave me, I'll sacrifice myself\" moment between Hermes and Kino. Kino climbs down into this chasm leaving Hermes behind after Hermes insists on it, and it seems like Kino genuinely thinks she's actively sacrificing Hermes and will never see him again. But the sheep just outright don't attack Hermes at all and he's fine, and then Kino comes back, murders all the sheep, and then reclaims Hermes and does an action jump over the chasm to escape from the remainder of the sheep whose home she outright caused to become engulfed with flames and filled with the corpses of their sheep brothers and sisters.\n\nWhat really puts a bow on this whole country/episode is that after Kino and Hermes finally escape and make it to the actual country, a guard asks her if she saw some sheep in the countryside. Because, lo and behold, the reason for the ravenous and violent sheep army is that this country until JUST RECENTLY would force sheep to do battle with each other for the entertainment of the people.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/ZPhG3qZ.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/a45Xa2s.png)~~~\n\nSheep... sheep fighting. Why sheep? No seriously, why sheep? Is it seriously not dogs because that'd be too obvious, or the only way to make your already unlikable character even more unlikable is having her gun down an army of dogs? \n\nimg300(https://i.imgur.com/IdWVgOV.png)\n\nTo be honest, if it were dogs, the serious tone to the episode would be way less silly. But no yeah, people hate seeing dogs die in things, so fuck it, have it be sheep I guess. Nobody likes sheep. Kino can do trick shots blasting sheep back into the flames of hell and running over CG sheep in a car all day long.\n\nLet's not even go into the fact that... like in the original anime/at least some of the early volumes of the novel, Kino does and is actually forced to kill both in defense of herself and just to provide her with food when she's on the road. Like she's actually killed people.\n\nBut in the entirety of Kino 2017... she just kills some sheep (oh and I guess the tyrant in the coliseum episode but that shouldn't even count since that's one of the remake episodes). That's it. It's not like I want to see Kino entering crazy and ridiculous gun battles or just her killing things in general. But there were actually some dark or weighty countries or ones with actual conflict...\n\nYet for Kino 2017 the only thing that comes close is... Kino gunning down an army of sheep. It's absolutely baffling.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/OJNUmCz.png)\n\n___\n\n#K-2: The Remake Episodes#\n\nI figured I'd do an entire separate section for these at the start but... I'm now coming to terms that the remake episodes are probably the least interesting reason why I dislike Kino 2017. Because they're quite literal remakes or new versions of stories that were done in the 2003 anime... there's not really much to talk about with them.\n\nLike I probably could actually watch both versions side by side simultaneously and point out all the differences or changes that 2017 makes, and yeah, maybe that'd actually make me even more upset at this adaptation than I already am. But to be honest, I think the very dumb location for two out of the three remake episodes is infinitely worse than any of the specific changes they made to the episodes/stories themselves. The idea of remaking the final country of the 2003 version which was a perfect final episode and NOT having it again as the final episode is just... \n\nThere's no getting around it. It's absolutely idiotic. I genuinely was a bit misty eyed when I first watched the original version of that episode, but I felt absolutely nothing this time around. I didn't see any motivation for why Kino would suddenly want to stay longer in the country beyond \"well it's nice here\" when in the original Kino had gone through some pretty rough countries at this point. Additionally, I should note that this episode is one of the few points of Kino 2017 where Kino does crack and actually show some form of emotion but... it felt like it disappeared almost literally one second later. Like it fucking evaporated into thin air.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/Yw4nGan.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/lIl2ffd.png)~~~\n\n_Hmm... yeah, you know, if I had to choose one, I'd say I definitely believe the top Kino is witnessing an entire town's worth of people dying as a flow of lava just essentially wipes their country off the face of the Earth._\n\nThe coliseum episode I was initially fine with them remaking, but now I'm not so sure. Because sure, the original version was two episodes long rather than one, and there was actually a bit more atmosphere and the fighters were a bit more fleshed out when Kino found herself in this dingy underground with all of the other competitors. But really when you get down to it, the only reason why they included this in Kino 2017 is because this is where Shizu is introduced, and becomes essentially one of the few recurring characters of Kino no Tabi. But in the end, despite the inclusion of Shizu, all we get from the final moments of this show is Kino and her fucking hammock despite the surprisingly large focus on Shizu, Riku, and Ti throughout the rest of the show.\n\nOh, here's a bit of a confession. I skipped episode 11, which is the remake of Kino's backstory up until writing this sentence of the review. If there's anything especially noteworthy or glaring changes I notice while watching it mid-review, I will include them following this sentence. If I don't, it's probably just generally worse than the original's version.\n\n...\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/tTMv10r.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/hMVel8v.png)~~~\n\n...Kino's parents were a bit... I didn't like the direction they took with them this time around. I remember them being a bit calmer in the original? I don't think the original voice actors screamed/overacted quite as much as the 2017's version. Like yeah I know in the original/story they go off on young Kino after she tells them she doesn't want to receive a lobotomy anymore but...\n\nAlso, wait hold on.\n\nimg440(https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DMuaVkgUMAAnBM7.jpg)\n\nKino 2017's eyes are green. But then both her younger self as well as her adult self SOLELY in this episode's eyes are purple.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/tTLmMIk.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/kvf0sCs.png)~~~\n\nWait, why? What about the original Kino???\n\n~~~img440(https://pm1.narvii.com/6264/e811f4df02e5286c14ad89e4829a13b0e97f8902_hq.jpg)~~~ ~~~img440(http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/deadliestfiction/images/4/43/KinoCannon1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20121114045127)~~~\n\n...We have to go even further down this rabbit hole. What about one of the manga Kino's???\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/zIKxymn.png)\n\n...This started out as an observation of solely Kino 2017, but now that I'm looking at them, even in the covers of the actual novels, her eye color is all over the place. Blue, green, purple, gray... why? This is just a small thing I only just now noticed which ultimately doesn't matter too much, because I honestly could care less about Kino's appearance when her character in Kino 2017 is just... a husk of nothingness.\n\n...But apparently I'm an idiot, as this happens way earlier than when my brain first noticed it. Behold Kino 2017, the blue eyes edition.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/2JLcg9z.png)\n\n\"Who even cares if one of the most first commonly noticed physical characteristics of our character is completely inconsistent?\"\n\n___\n\n#K-2: Conclusion#\n\nI honestly don't know if they could have ended Kino 2017 any more obnoxiously than they did. After the absurd sheep story, we just get Kino and Hermes talking over basically a mostly still image of Kino lying in a hammock for like five straight minutes (including the ED). Kino and Hermes mentions \"HER JOURNEY\" over and over again and it's like they have no idea how much they should try and hammer it in so they just go overboard with it. But basically they imply \"well we could maybe do a season two but if we don't then oh well... Kino will keep on traveling!\"\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/N0qMsff.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/fAbgS0p.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/sjV2ij7.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/kus65ek.png)~~~\n\n...I'll pass on a season two (that's also brought to us by Lerche) of this, thank you. And you know if Kino 2003 would have ended with Kino explaining to Hermes that she's going to take a nap and maybe, MAYBE if she wakes up, she'll start out on her journey again FOR SEVERAL MINUTES, I would have reacted as negatively as I did when the 2017 version did this. But no, Kino 2003 was fine with actually ending with a little bit of finality. There was no \"well maybe Kino will get a new awful adaptation 14 years after ours but sure yeah, she'll keep traveling\" after Kino drove off on Hermes.\n\nKino 2003 remains a solid __9 out of 10__ for me. Kino 2017 on the other hand... is a __1 out of 10__. I really do genuinely believe that this goes way further than \"I hate it just because I liked the original so much\" and that if you tried to watch Kino 2017 and HATED it, maybe do actually go back and try Kino 2003. Like sure the animation is old but everything else is just... so much better.\n\nOtherwise, my general recommendation would be to watch the original anime and if you enjoy it, possibly consider trying the novels out. Because while okay, all of the stories in Kino 2017 are ALL from the novels. The moving country, Photo's story, the goddamned sheep, and so forth. But what I'm thinking is that while apparently, and to be fair I only checked the moving country story for this, the anime is seemingly faithful in adapting these stories...\n\n...Maybe these stories have less of an impact when going through the novels themselves. Because what I really want to believe is that Kino 2017, that Lerche for some reason apart from the remake episodes, FOR SOME REASON actively chose the worst stories of the entire series and shoved them all together in one package along with some remakes of the earlier stories. Like I honestly don't want to believe that the entire series beyond like the last of what the 2003 anime adapted is just... awful.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/dw9Mfzs.png)\n\nI didn't even go into this one, but what even was the point of doing an entire episode entirely of just off cuts? Like obviously they were miniature countries or bits probably scattered throughout the novels but why do an episode of _just_ those? Like oh okay, Kino went to a country primarily of chefs, cooked for them, and then left. Or like a couple of bandits looking for people to ambush and rob both see Shizu as well as Kino and decide to not attack them but for different reasons and that's the end of THAT story. Couldn't... couldn't you have used this episode's spot for an actual country where she did anything that mattered?\n\nYou had twenty one volumes of material to choose from and... you're saying that in your opinion these were overall the best stories and most worthy to adapt and therefore that's why you chose them for the first Kino adaptation in ___fourteen years___?\n\nI don't buy it, Lerche. _I JUST DON'T BUY IT._\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/YvWnkFk.png)\n\nWait...

The characters of Just Because are as generic as it's possible to be; to be fair I should say that they are even more generic than that. They're not generic to the point of you can think of they as normal people like you and your friends but rather to the point that the only figure in my life I can associate them to is that guy with black hairs that always sits two seats away from me in class and that I never talked to nor I plant to. This is the huge main problem of the show: the viewer will unlikely care for any of the characters; in my case I got to episode 11 barely remembering their names: to me they were \"the emo boy\", \"the big guy\", \"the red girl\", \"the violet girl\" and \"the girl with the camera\", nothing different form that \"guy whit black hairs that always sits two seats away from me in class\". Moreover any attempt to give those characters any distinctive trait (except in the case of \"the girl with the camera\") fails: \"the big guy\" and \"the emo boy\" are apparently interested in baseball but this thing (apart from being used to explain why they are friends) serve no purpose at all, \"the violet girl\" is a trumpet player but if she had been a pianist that would have changed almost nothing of her (and of the show) and \"the red girl\" seems interested in nothing at all apart from studying. That's not how people work: hobbies and passions are what truly make people make sense as people; disregarding this aspect is one of the biggest errors possible while writing characters.\n\n~~~img720(http://randomc.net/image/Just%20Because/Just%20Because%20-%2003%20-%20Large%2022.jpg)\n \"the emo boy\", \"the girl with the camera\" and \"the red girl\" doing something~~~\n\nAll of this \"don't giving a fuck about the characters\" was a constant during the show but Just Bacause featured some variables as well. For example the quality of the drawings and animations dropped during the latest episodes (with characters changing completely between scenes and an uncountable amout of derp faces) and the overall rythmh of the show got slower and slower. During the last 4 episodes I was completely unable to look at the show at normal speed; I had to watch at 2x speed everything that wasn't a dialogue in order not to scream for how slow it was: there's really a point in making people walks so slowly and spamming transition scenes with landscapes and trains every two minutes? If that was an attempt to make the viewer feel nostalgic or something like that well, it failed since the only things I felt while watching the show were frustration and a strong desire to kill myself.\n\n~~~img720(https://i.imgur.com/9L0dDSN.jpg)\n\"the big guy\" listening to \"the violet girl\"~~~\n\nThis whole situation brought me to a point at wich I was actively wishing for a School Days like last episode (wich unfortunately I didn't got) and the only reason for me to finish this show was to then make fun of it with some friends of mine. Just Because probably also have some good points but honestly I can't think of one, as Hofstadter once said about Ray Kurzweil's books, \"It's as if you took a lot of very good food and some dog excrement and blended it all up so that you can't possibly figure out what's good or bad\" (with the only difference that in this case we don't know if the \"good food\" actually exi sts).##"}, {"id": 2367, "score": 0, "body": "Fate/Apocrypha is an new entry to the fate franchise and was produced by our good old friends A1 Pictures, which is totally.. acceptable?\nIt describes the alternate story of the 4th holy grail war and that war is kinda different from that what we used to see in Fate/Zero.. for example.

I told you the cast is interesting\nimg220(https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e2z50zK-yQQ/maxresdefault.jpg)\n\nand Holy shit is that a crossover episode!?\nimg220(https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M_wPf0d4sk4/maxresdefault.jpg)\n\nSo you guys know now the basic story and some characters.. right? Right\n\nLet's come to the fun part now Animation and Music,\n\nand I have to say that anime is looking good. Well that's something A1 Pictures is kinda decent at\nCharacters are looking beautiful and the set building as well but there is one thing that was striking my eyes every time it came to an fight.\nThe downgrade of details to make an more fluid animation which is totally acceptable.\nThe fights were looking great and it was fun to watch but it was noticeable to a certain degree.. especially in the last six episodes.. \n\nSame thing goes for the music, the music is good nothing outstanding but it supports the fights and the different scenes pretty decent.\nPLUS the openings are really really nice. I didn't like the endings that much, well they are just normal endings. Not every ending can be like Kekkai Sensens.. I love that fucking ending or that one from Youjo Senki.. that damn nazi loli\n\nAll in all Fate Apocrypha was an ok viewing experience and would be even more enjoyable if you just watch and don't use your brain.. the same reason why we are having fun with stupid harem and ecchi shows.. I mean maybe you enjoy watching it.. or you just hate it\nTo be honest this anime is ok, \nI would recommend it to people who like action anime and don't really mind how the characters are written and so on.\nAnd if you are just starting with the Fate series, Just watch Fate/Zero and UBW first and then watch apocrypha if you still want to.\n\nI'm not going to give this anime a score (that's why there is a 0/100),\nI'm just gonna say watch it if that what I wrote sounds interesting to you or don't watch it and move on to watch different shows."}, {"id": 2371, "score": 10, "body": "Hello! I don't know what prompted you to click on this review, whether it was simple curiosity, you genuinely wonder what I think of this show, or you've watched this show yourself in the past so you know _exactly_ what's coming. But whatever the case, we're going to go on an adventure today. Because this review is in fact going to be a total breakdown of this show and therefore means, this review is going to be __FULL SPOILERS__. I feel a special warning needs to be given right away since this is a mystery and if you find out everything, the effect of the show will be ruined. So once again, __THIS REVIEW GIVES AWAY THE ENTIRETY OF THE PLOT OR WHATEVER MYSTERY WAS PRESENT IN THIS ANIME.__\n \nBut if you wanted a non-spoilers take on this show, let me go ahead and quickly sum up the review I am about to write. This show is an amazing and wonderful journey to go on. I was in awe with almost every single scene at how masterfully crafted the dialogue was. It felt as if I was trapped within this show and could not leave until the last grains of the sand in an hourglass tumbled to the bottom. I would absolutely recommend everyone to watch this show, and give it a score of __10/100__.\n \nAnd no, that isn't a typo, and I _did not_ forget a zero.\n \nLet's just dive right into this, now.\n \nyoutube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_HNq_Pa2t4)\n \n_Also, this show did NOT deserve this OP._\n___\n \n#Chapter One: Introductions#\n \nThis is an adaptation of the novel of the same title by [MORI Hiroshi](https://anilist.co/staff/100190/HiroshiMori), brought to us by [A-1 Pictures](https://anilist.co/studio/561/A1Pictures). On top of this anime adaptation, it also received a visual novel, a manga adaptation, and a live TV drama. But we're here of course, to discuss the anime. Also, there'll be an entire section dedicated to the author himself, but like I said, we are _forced_ to discuss the anime first.\n \nThough, I'm not really too sure where to start. Like going in, I was aware that this was apparently of the mystery genre, but then the first episode was more or less mostly just the two main characters sitting in a room talking to each other. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/aD3Nh81.png)\n\nLet's get this right out of the way, this show is almost entirely dialogue. Apart from like a select series of scenes that show a certain character's past, every scene is talking and more talking. Like something happens in episode two, and basically the rest of the episodes are more less entirely the characters talking about what happened in episode two and who did it, and how it happened, and just... I feel bad for anybody who actually got suckered into actually caring about the ultimate result.\n \nYou have all this goddamned build up and I can  just picture someone seriously watching this show and actually going: \"Well who's the killer? What was the meaning of this? How did they do it? ...Oh, that's how it happened? That's... who did it? ...__Oh.__ _Ohhhhhhhh_. Fuck.\"\n \nLike this may or may not be perceived as a bit harsh, but I'm talking Glasslip level type of scenes. They just talk and talk and talk and talk and  talk, but unlike Glasslip, there's a layer of incomprehensible pretentiousness to almost all of the dialogue that I just found kept bringing me back into it. That being said, there were definitely some conversations that were a bit more bland where despite trying my best to retain my focus on the show, I found myself staring at the wall in front of my computer as they continued to talk.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/8G1i8yh.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/bAXy71X.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/CuCCxmn.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/OIJtTCX.png)~~~\n \nBut then the mystery element I was told that was present in the show finally showed itself and then... then the characters started to talk again.\n \nDid I mention that there is talking in this anime? Did I mention that they recap the original incident that this show is based entirely around several times after the viewer themselves watches it happen? Like okay, I get it. Stop going over the exact same thing again, and again, and again. Do something to try and figure it out. Do anything. Just do anything, _PLEASE_.\n \nWe had eleven episodes to get this done in, and it feels like nothing had happened at all of note like five episodes in. Like even at the very end, when the show was finally giving us answers, it still felt like the show hadn't even started.\n \nI really need to stress this. There has been no other series where I have been this confounded about what the fuck the overall purpose of the series was upon finishing it. Like after finishing Glasslip, I could actually say \"well this was a slice of life/drama series that tried to tell a story but like with chicken metaphors I guess\". But with Perfect Insider like... everything about the mystery itself and the motivations of the characters investigating the mystery is just so fucking nonsensical and all over the place that I just can't. I just can't.\n \nI feel like I'm dissecting some alien life form, trying to figure out what the fuck it even is.\n \n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/PaW2WMJ.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/gWo7X3C.png)~~~\n\n___\n \n#Chapter Two: Characters#\n \nOkay, in this series, we have three characters that matter. Obviously, there are more than three characters in the show, but only three matter. And even right now a day after finishing watching this show, I'm already blanking on the names of two out of the three characters. The only reason why I remember the third is because her name is said and brought up in all the dialogue over and over, and over again.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/BhuKBFr.jpg)\n \nFirst, we have one of two of our protagonists. Souhei Saikawa. Let's go over the things that the show establishes about his character, shall we? He is a professor, he hates watermelon and other things, he can't properly do his eyedrops, he doesn't care much about anything really, he has a hobby of shutting the other protagonist the fuck down almost passively whenever he can, and he smokes. He smokes a lot. Almost every other scene, he's smoking. In the first couple of episodes, he asks if he can smoke in the island laboratory at least two times, maybe three. And him repeatedly asking if he can smoke is perhaps one of the most notable things I can recall about his character.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/rRSkK4W.png)\n \nOh, and apparently, he's intelligent. There's absolutely nothing about his character that is established apart from his past with the other protagonist that goes beyond \"he's some professor\", yet he is treated and acts like a \"detective\" character. Or well, he eventually starts acting like this. In the first handful of episodes, he could honestly give less than two shits about the mystery and is actually on the verge of leaving just because I guess he doesn't give a fuck anymore despite the fact two people are dead at this point. He eventually doesn't leave because he's pestered by the other protagonist or rather, his sidekick character, and then he finally starts to act a bit more proactive in trying to figure this whole thing out.\n \nThen, when everything starts to get revealed, the series starts treating him and the culprit character like they're fucking Detective Akechi and Twenty Faces right out of Ranpo Edogawa's fiction. Like he's some brilliant detective that figured out this culprit's scheme and the culprit gets away to fight another day but they respect the professor's intellect and they're gonna return and fuck with him again at some point and just _go fuck yourself (I thought this phrase a lot throughout watching the entirety of this show)_. I'm sorry, but you're not Ranpo Edogawa. Maybe you could have potentially fooled me, if your goddamned professor character had acted like he gave a shit before the series actually REQUIRED him to.\n \nBut hey, maybe he gets fleshed out a bit more or he does actually have to face the culprit again  in the nine other novels MORI Hiroshi wrote about this guy and his sidekick. Thankfully, I'll never find out, because even if they ever get translated, I never want to read a single thing by this guy if this is in fact a genuine and true adaptation of something he wrote. Unlike with Ranpo Kitan, I have much  more reason to believe this is the case.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/9o0X3Xj.png)\n \nLet's not get sidetracked any further though, and move onto the sidekick character, Moe Nishinosono. A... I actually don't know if she's a student of the professor, or what. Like I can still remember the backstory they eventually gave to how she and the professor met but... I can't recall if she was actually a student of the professor at the university or if she just creepily hangs around him 24/7.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/lEGCoot.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/ljZFGOW.png)~~~\n \nOne of my favorite parts in this series was how much the professor just shut and put Nishinosono down. I know that may or may not sound a bit sadistic, but it eventually began to approach an absurd level. Like from the very start of the show, Nishinosono is in love with the professor but the professor seems to only be interested in the third character, and of course Nishinosono (I'm honestly going to start just calling her \"Nishi\" after this point) gets super fucking upset and pouty if the professor even comes into close contact with any other female character.\n \nAnd like her love for the professor is no fucking secret, he is basically completely aware of it and he is still shutting her down.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/dWMh2do.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/pPDh9Co.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/QCfRpQ3.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/GNS1jlu.png)~~~\n \nJesus Christ. Also, I don't want to make the comparison to Kobayashi in Ranpo Kitan because Kobayashi was way more of a fun and interesting character, but Nishi almost feels... like okay.\n \nFirst of all, she's the one who's primarily interested in solving the mystery of the show, and actually makes a struggling effort to try and get Professor Who Gives a Fuck to care. But like after a corpse missing their legs and arms is wheeled out on a cart, she's acting like it's no fucking big deal and she repeatedly mentions \"wow I can't believe I can laugh when the third character is FUCKING DEAD\" but then like in an episode or two, like some switch is flipped, and her character is just crying at numerous points of the episode. And I just... like what? Why are you having this emotion now? YOU WERE PERFECTLY FINE IN JUST THE OTHER EPISODE. THE RESEARCHERS AND SCIENTISTS OF THIS LABORATORY WERE FREAKING THE FUCK OUT BECAUSE THERE'S APPARENTLY A MURDERER ON THE LOOSE, BUT YOU WERE FINE. NOW YOU'RE CRYING. WHY?\n \nAnd then, and THEN, EIGHT EPISODES INTO THE SHOW AND AFTER NISHI BASICALLY HAD TO DRAG THE PROFESSOR BACK TO THE LABROATORY AFTER AN EPISODE THAT IS STRAIGHT UP JUST 100% \"well the professor and nishi will leave the lab and take a break from the mystery aka THE ENTIRE POINT OF THE SHOW\"...\n\nNISHI STRAIGHT UP SAYS... \n \n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/hxdLRR2.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/nQaoADw.png)~~~\n \n#___...REALLY?___#\n \nOF THE TWO CHARACTERS, YOU WERE THE ONE WHO WAS ACTING LIKE YOU CARED ABOUT THIS MYSTERY THE MOST. IF EVEN THE CHARACTERS DON'T CARE, THEN HOW IN THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO? TWO PEOPLE ARE APPARENTLY DEAD, BUT I JUST CARE ABOUT GETTING CLOSE TO THIS PROFESSOR WHO DOESN'T GIVE A FUCK AND REPEATEDLY SHUTS ME THE FUCK DOWN EVEN THOUGH YEARS AGO, APPARENTLY HE CARED ENOUGH TO MORE OR LESS GET ME TO HAVE A DESIRE TO LIVE ON AFTER MY PARENTS DIED IN A HORRIFIC PLANE CRASH.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/Rj3DarG.jpg)\n \nOur third and final character is Shiki Magata, and she is...\n \n...Actually you know what, stop. Just stop. We'll get to her later.\n \n___\n \n#Chapter Three: Dialogue Dialogue Dialogue#\n \nSo, let's talk about the dialogue. Episode one is a perfect... like episode one has everything you're going to get from the rest of the show. Because ninety percent of it is just characters sitting or standing in a room talking with each other, and the dialogue is just... like take pretentious or dumb lines someone thought was cool or smart, odd and sometimes downright baffling scene transitions, and just a general numbing boredom and throw them all into a pot and mix it up, and you get Perfect Insider.\n \nFrom the very start, I was fully engaged in this show because almost every time I was starting to feel bored, there would be a line of dialogue that would really strike me and forcibly drag the attention of my brain back to the show. There were just so many... like see, it honestly feels like to me that this show is in fact an adaptation of an actual novel, but simultaneously, it feels like it's NOT. Because I am in utter disbelief... like a part of my brain stubbornly wants to give the original creator a sliver of the benefit of the doubt. Like no, this novel is apparently well liked, it apparently won awards, the original novel CANNOT possibly be this bad.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/btmKbi9.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/IBR9DSU.png)~~~\n\n_What's the most important information to know about a character to establish in the first episode if it's NOT what they don't like to eat?_\n \nAnd full disclosure maybe the original novel is in fact slightly better, but I am most likely never going to find out, because even if this particular novel was translated in English (it's not), that is how negative of an overall impression this anime has made on me. Like if this anime is even slightly accurate to MORI Hiroshi's novel, then holy shit that novel is literally __a waste of paper.__\n\n_...That's admittedly probably one of the harshest things I've ever written about a person's work of fiction without having actually read the original source material, but let me try and justify it in the rest of the 9,000 words of this review._\n \nDon't get me wrong. I have nothing wrong with having a lot of dialogue. Hell, Glasslip was even worse in this department as that dialogue got way less laughs out of me, but I'd still probably not even call Glasslip the worst show I've ever watched. But if you're going to have a lot of dialogue and want it to be ~~purposely~~ good, then it has to be well written or interesting in any way.\n \nWorking out the details of a single murder or aspects of it over and over and over again in multiple episodes is... look, I haven't watched the TV drama, but I find it fucking suspect that in the TV drama version, the story that this anime is adapting is like only two episodes. It makes me wonder, were the TV drama people simply cutting a bunch of redundant shit out from the novel, or if the anime staff were desperately trying to stretch out the material to eleven episodes.\n \nThose are the things I'm thinking about when I look back on this series. Not memorable characters, not memorable scenes, but trying to figure out whose fault it is.\n \nI mentioned this in the section about the Characters, but it bears repeating. There are just so many weird and strange emotional or tonal shifts that happen throughout the dialogue. You think it's going to go one way, but then it completely flies off into the unknown.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/FbEVdIB.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/tYbdg17.png)~~~\n\n_God damn it, Nishi. There is a MUTILATED CORPSE ON A CART just in the other hallway._ \n\nWhy is Nishi so upbeat and jovial after witnessing a corpse who has had their legs and arms sawed off be wheeled out on an automated cart? Why does she start crying throughout an entire episode after having a dream? Was it just a delayed reaction to the corpse? The staff of the laboratory facility is shown freaking out and sound genuinely distressed around when the murders happen, but then the rest of the time they seem perfectly normal? Isn't there supposed to be a murderer still roaming around? Why the fuck does one of them feel like it's the perfect time to show Nishi the virtual reality machines where the virtual world is shown being created in the form of LEGO BLOCKS? She's hopping around on skyscrapers with her ideal and perfect dream version of the professor WASN'T THIS A FUCKING MYSTERY SERIES WITH MURDERS, WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/BEQGfB6.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/tSjPuv8.png)~~~\n \nThen the girl that forced her to undress so she could show her the virtual reality machine tells her from the other pod over that she's having a sexual experience with a different virtual version of the professor WHICH ISN'T WEIRD AT ALL. BUT HEY IN THE END, THE VIRTUAL REALITY MACHINE ENDS UP PROGRESSING THE PLOT, WHEN THE KILLER REALIZES WHAT THE FUCK THE PERSON WHO WAS MOST INTERESTED IN THE MYSTERY IS DOING WITH HER TIME AND THEN CONTACTS HER THROUGH THE VIRTUAL REALITY MACHINE.\n \n\"That's pretty weird. They haven't made as much progress as I would have thought. I guess I'll throw them a bone?\"\n \nAlso, can I just say... I'm going to go further into this later, but it was really fucking transparent what they were doing when they kept mentioning specific details over and over again. The more and more you bring something up as a concrete thing, the more it's gonna cause me to question if that's really the case. Professor and Nishi already know that Magata, our third character, has been isolated in this room for fifteen years and that nobody has been in or out for the entirety of those fifteen years.\n \n...Why do you keep bringing it up? Why do you keep bringing up the fact that she created this operating system the ENTIRE FACILITY runs on over and over again? Why do you keep saying this operating system that SHE designed is perfect and foolproof when something WENT WRONG? Are these important plot points? Should I jot them down in my notepad?\n \nOh, this is important. Can't finish this section off without talking about this. There is an actual scene where Professor and Magata's older sister sit down and talk, and it's been multiple episodes after Magata's sister has entered the show, but she hasn't gotten a single line of dialogue. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/kaVCzb3.png)\n\nLo and behold, you could miss them mentioning this detail, but she is from America or for some reason speaks only in English? So the Professor has a conversation with her in English and it lasts from five to ten minutes, possibly even longer, but it feels like it goes on for fucking ever. I was immediately ejected from the scene, because my attention immediately flew to seeing how long it was going to go on for.\n \nIt feels so very much like something they took right from the novel and it just does not translate. In a novel form, you just include as a side note: \"The Professor and Magata's sister spoke in English.\" But in anime form, we... have to actually hear that conversation, and nothing is correct. I can't even describe it. It is hands down one of the absolute worst scenes of the entire show as I've never been so forcibly knocked out of a show before. Additionally, my favorite detail about that scene is the fact that Magata's sister speaks in English ~!just does not matter in any way shape or form and is a complete fucking red herring.!~\n \nTo conclude on the dialogue, can I just throw this out there? The professor straight up says to Nishi at one point early on that he hates expository dialogue in mysteries.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/wx0Ts7X.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/Qr7aZ49.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/8goOygL.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/XFN1j5L.png)~~~\n \n# ...What. The fuck. Did you just say. #\n\n~~~img(https://i.imgur.com/5hF3jMV.png)~~~\n\n__~~~AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA~~~__\n \n___\n \n#Chapter Four: Deciphering the Plot#\n \nMaybe the actual title of this show should have been Everything Becomes F...\n \n_...ucking Stupid._\n \nBecause now I'm going to attempt to accurately describe the plot of this series, which is not going to be a very easy task at all.\n \nThe show starts with the Professor and Nishi talking in his office, the Professor leaves temporarily to go help a student with his computer problems, Nishi takes the opportunity to snoop and look at the Professor's computer and to her dismay finds that he was reading about Shiki Magata who is in fact female and thus this irritates Nishi, who then proceeds to suggest to the Professor to take his entire class to the island where Shiki Magata is being kept in isolation in the Magata Research Facility as a result of having killed her own parents as a child but was found insane rather than guilty.\n \nAlmost the entire rest of the show takes place on this island, that Nishi pushes the Professor into going to with his entire class. For Nishi knows that the Professor has an interest in meeting Magata as he admires her for some reason, so she wishes to meet with Magata again now that the Professor knows she's capable of meeting with her, but doesn't wish to let the Professor and Magata actually meet themselves.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/g4oj5mW.png)\n \n...But then when they get to the facility, oh no, it turns out she was murdered and had her arms and legs cut off! And then, the rest of the show is about them solving (or not solving) the mystery.\n \nThere are multiple plot threads going on throughout the show and they're all thrown together in one gigantic jumbled mess. It'll switch from one to the other at the drop of a fucking hat.  We've got them trying to solve the mystery, Nishi's prior meeting with Magata which it'll switch to multiple times throughout the entirety of the show, scenes showing Magata's past with her INCESTUOUS ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP WITH HER UNCLE and her murdering her parents because literally why not, and the past of or how Nishi and the Professor met.\n \n...But the main plot of the show is of course obviously, them trying to solve the mystery. Which coincidentally, or perhaps not coincidentally, is I think perhaps the absolute worst section of the show. Like both the scenes of Magata's past as well as how Nishi met the Professor could have been removed from this show and expanded into complete and far more interesting shows than... the actual main plot of this show.\n \nThat finally brings us to where this review is about to finally and at long last go completely off the rails. I hope you paid attention to the warning at the start of the review if you cared about being spoiled.\n \nBecause there's no way I can possibly discuss how terrible the mystery of the show is without fully giving it away entirely.\n\nBut first, here is a __completely irrelevant__ exchange that happens _several episodes_ before the mystery is solved.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/KF73PQC.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/3SmsISx.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/ioMdLvk.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/woMHV0e.png)~~~\n\nHave you figured it out yet?\n \n___\n \n#Chapter Five: The Culprit#\n \n...Before we reach the peak of idiocy, something needs to be stated really quickly. As my reviews are to an extent purposely comedic in nature, it could be perceived that I'm often exaggerating when I bring up the more absurd moments in certain shows I review, such as this one. However...\n\nIn most cases, but especially this one, I must stress that this is in fact the show. I am in fact not trying to make it sound any funnier or more absurd than it is, this is actually what the show has to offer. I genuinely feel sorry for anyone who sat through the entirety of this show seriously watching it and hoping for all of the dialogue to build up to anything. Because it just fucking crashes and burns in perhaps one of the most spectacular train wrecks I have ever seen.\n \nThe culprit of the show, the person who was behind it all, the murderer of Shiki Magata our one out of THREE characters... drumroll please...\n \n...is Shiki Magata.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/a0alQpz.png)\n \nWow. The victim is __ALSO__ the murderer? That'd be a pretty good and satisfying twist in itself, ___RIGHT?___ \n\nBut no, there's more. See, the truth really was that nobody else but Shiki Magata entered that room fifteen years ago. However, do you remember her incestuous relationship she had with her uncle? That's right. She was pregnant with her _cousin daughter_ when she went into isolation after knifing her parents to death after originally planning on manipulating her uncle to commit the murders. You're probably clawing at your computer monitor at this point, begging for this to stop. But it doesn't. There's __even more.__\n \nSee, the corpse that is wheeled out at the start of the show is in fact a Magata. It is in fact, Shiki Magata's daughter. Who was posing as her older sister (SHE HAS AGED FIFTEEN YEARS BUT NO NOBODY QUESTIONS THE FACT THAT THE IMPOSTOR SHIKI MAGATA LOOKS EXACTLY HOW SHE DOES WHEN SHE ENTERED THE ROOM), whom eventually wished for her daughter to eventually kill her. But as a result of Nishi asking the false Shiki Magata a three word long question, that being, \"Who are you?\", Shiki's daughter became conflicted to the point where she killed herself. Shiki Magata being absolutely brilliant and a genius realized, okay, my plan didn't go as I planned it, so now I'll cut off my daughter's arms and legs, put the rest of her corpse on a cart, and then wheel it out into the hallway when the door will open at the very specific moment I programmed into the operating system the people who are apparently supposedly keeping me in isolation used for the entire facility of which I'm being kept isolated in.\n \n_I know it really seems like I'm making this shit up on the spot, but I'm not, I swear. If I were, I would be an award winning and published novelist like MORI Hiroshi, god damn it._\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/u8djJkY.png)\n \nThis way, I can then use my daughter's mutilated corpse which I then also took the time to dress up in a wedding dress after I removed her arms and legs as a distraction, so I can get into the elevator and get to the roof, and when my uncle who is the director of this facility in which I was being kept isolated comes back in the helicopter, I will pretend to be my older sister from America who may or may not be a complete lie I created myself. I will then later return to the roof and my uncle will allow me to personally and literally stab him in the back gruesomely with my knife, because I wanted my daughter to kill both her parents and while I'm perfectly fine with murdering my uncle aka her father, I'm later going to say I won't kill myself, I instead want someone else to kill me.\n \nOh, and then I'm going to just fuck with the Professor and Nishi and purposely try and see if they can catch me, and then I will get away, but then I'll come back to talk to the Professor specifically because I apparently respected his totally present intellect, and then pretend I am captured by his guards after meeting with him, but that was completely unneeded and just one last thing to fuck with the Professor and also further mislead the viewer.\n \nInstead, I get away completely scot free, and the show ends with me talking to my alternate personalities.\n \n...\n \n...This is a real show that exists. There is no possible way to defend this twist. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/qSuZ5qd.png)\n\nThey made it a point to have false Magata to be shown wearing gloves in her video meeting with Nishi because the purpose of the gloves were to prevent false Magata from leaving fingerprints for her fifteen year long stay in that room with her mother? But... but, shouldn't they have had cameras in the room itself to keep track of what this person being kept isolated since she brutally murdered her parents is doing? IF THEY HAD CAMERAS, AT ONE POINT OR ANOTHER IN THE SPAN OF FIFTEEN YEARS, ONE OF THOSE CAMERAS WOULD CATCH TWO MAGATAS ON THE SCREEN ONCE. But no, just have the front of outside of the door have cameras. That makes total sense.\n \nBut what makes this twist even more offensive is that like throughout the entire show, Magata is treated like a fucking brilliant and level headed genius by almost all of the characters. One of the hugest aspects of the Professor's character is that he admires and supposedly wants to be like Magata. But we're straight up shown that at thirteen years old, this apparent genius actively entered an incestuous relationship with her uncle, and I think the original purpose she had for this was she was going to have her uncle be the one to commit the murders.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/vyiZnpH.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/EWVFsA7.png)~~~\n \nYet when time to comes to brutally murder her parents with a knife, she just straight up takes the knife away from the uncle and basically does it herself. It's established and reiterated over and over again that Magata has alternate personalities, and is actually shown at various points of the show to actually talk to these alternate personalities. But hey TGG, she can make operating systems and a Lego Block Virtual Reality system, SHE'S A GENIUS. Are you kidding me?\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/QBJioje.png)\n \nWHY WOULD YOU LET THE PERSON YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE KEEPING ISOLATED DESIGN THE ENTIRE OPERATING SYSTEM OF THE FACILITY? DON'T YOU THINK THAT WAS A BAD IDEA? YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND TRY TO GO FOR THE ACTUALLY INSANE BUT GENIUS MURDERER CHARACTER, BUT THE MOMENT THAT IT IS ESTABLISHED THAT SHE HAD ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEMS WITH HACKING HER DAUGHTER'S ARMS AND LEGS OFF AFTER SHE KILLED HERSELF AS A RESULT OF HER MOTHER'S ACTIONS, IMMEDIATELY, THERE IS NO WAY TO STILL BE CAPABLE OF EMPATHIZING WITH THIS CHARACTER.\n \nBUT YET, THE OTHER CHARACTERS STILL TREAT HER LIKE A GENIUS. THE PROFESSOR HAS A LAUGH AFTER HE MEETS WITH HER AGAIN AFTER HE REALIZES SHE PULLED ONE LAST POINTLESS TRICK ON HIM AND THEN GOT AWAY.\n \nSHE GETS AWAY. AFTER FUCKING EVERYTHING, SHE GETS AWAY, AND THE SERIES JUST ENDS. _IT JUST STOPS._\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/OneUSui.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/YJlCzX2.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/6yblLvE.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/UjDl9tT.png)~~~\n\n_This is __actually__ how the show ends. Magata talking to nobody in virtual reality/dream space, then credits. And that's it. That's literally it._\n \nWHAT THE FUCK. I'M OKAY WITH THINGS WHERE THE VILLAIN WINS IN THE END OR GETS AWAY SCOT FREE, BUT THE VILLAIN HAS TO BE AN [INTERESTING OR WELL CREATED CHARACTER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Lecter). NOT LITERALLY PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST ACTUALLY INSANE CHARACTERS I HAVE EVER SEEN IN ANY MEDIUM.\n \nLike oh, I sawed my daughter's arms and legs off, but I'm gonna enter this cat and mouse game with these LITERALLY RANDOM STRANGERS and have a long extended conversation in English with this Professor while I'm pretending to be my own older and American sister.\n \n...WHY? I WILL PAY MONEY TO ANYONE WHO IS CAPABLE OF MAKING SENSE OF THIS CHARACTER'S ACTIONS THROUGHOUT THIS SERIES BEYOND \"WELL, SHE'S AN INSANE PERSON\". I KNOW SHE HERSELF STATES THAT SHE WANTS TO BE CAUGHT/KILLED, BUT UGH.\n \n___\n \n#Chapter Six: Computer Jargons#\n \n...You would think I'd be done, after that last section, but no. You see, this series is honestly almost too perfect in how absolutely terrible it is. The entire show, it's pounded into your head that the operating system that this facility runs on is foolproof and perfect as it was designed by the most brilliant genius that has ever lived within this universe, Shiki Magata.\n \n...It's not like this isolated genius killer could have possibly purposely sneaked a couple of secret flaws into the operating system to facilitate her escape or rather, when her room's door finally begins to open for the first time in fifteen years. And, of course, it's not like the people running this facility would check any of the versions of the operating system Magata gives them for any funny business. It's not like she's been stuck in a room for fifteen years, it's not like she's ever going to want to escape so she can be outside ever again.\n \nSo, what was the flaw? What was the little thing that Magata sneaked in resulting the cameras losing that one single second where she slips out of her room right after her daughter's mutilated corpse is wheeled out?\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/rSv7TbP.png)\n \n...It's time to discuss hexadecimals, and the title and one of the mysteries of this show. In other words, the saying \"Everything Becomes F.\" The characters discuss this saying that Magata leaves for them and what it could possibly mean. Magata has been stuck in that room for fifteen years, Magata's secret daughter is fifteen years old, the books and volumes Magata has in her room only go up to the number fifteen, and I believe the idea that a human mind basically straight up goes onto a downslide after the age of fifteen is repeatedly brought up and believed by Magata herself.\n \nEverything becomes F...\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/uW1QwP8.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/7w4ZOJt.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/sBO0bre.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/H0UuP9c.png)~~~ \n \nSee, this is where a basic general knowledge of hexadecimals comes in handy. Everybody knows about hexadecimals. Approximately .025 percent of all people on this Earth are aware of what hexadecimals are and the purpose they serve, but they are also aware that...\n \n...Ugh. Let's just... let's just drop the act and open Wikipedia.\n\nimg(https://i.imgur.com/x7113UC.png)\n \n_In mathematics and computing, hexadecimal (also base 16, or hex) is a positional numeral system with a radix, or base, of 16. It uses sixteen distinct symbols, most often the symbols 0\u00e2\u0080\u00939 to represent values zero to nine, and A,\u00e2\u0080\u0089B,\u00e2\u0080\u0089C,\u00e2\u0080\u0089D,\u00e2\u0080\u0089E,\u00e2\u0080\u0089F (or alternatively a, b, c, d, e, f) to represent values ten to fifteen._\n \n_Hexadecimal numerals are widely used by computer system designers and programmers. As each hexadecimal digit represents four binary digits (bits), it allows a more human-friendly representation of binary-coded values. One hexadecimal digit represents a nibble (4 bits), which is half of an octet or byte (8 bits). For example, a single byte can have values ranging from 00000000 to 11111111 in binary form, but this may be more conveniently represented as 00 to FF in hexadecimal._\n \n_In a non-programming context, a subscript is typically used to give the radix, for example the decimal value 10,995 would be expressed in hexadecimal as 2AF316. Several notations are used to support hexadecimal representation of constants in programming languages, usually involving a prefix or suffix. The prefix \"0x\" is used in C and related languages, where this value might be denoted as 0x2AF3._\n \nEverything becomes F... in other words, everything becomes fifteen, because F or rather, FFFFFF is in fact the hexadecimal that represents the number fifteen. The operating system that Magata designed is basically designed to have time either fall back or skip forward a single minute later fifteen years after she enters the room, causing the camera recording the front of the door of her room, to basically have two files of that one particular minute, leading to the one that actually captures her escaping to the elevator being overwritten. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/Y52r8fE.png)\n\nAnd that, my friends, is the genius scheme that the brilliant Magata uses to escape her room prison so she can murder her uncle lover, and then eventually proceed to escape the island.\n \nShould note that there's actually more to this, like while fifteen was I believe the key number involved, seven was also a relevant number because seven is apparently a \"lonely number\" or something. I just... this part of the show is just so fucking needlessly convoluted and dumb I just can't even be bothered to try and decipher it.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/GyGGDrZ.png)\n \nI mean, did I say convoluted and dumb? I meant _smart, intelligent, and deeply thought out._\n \n...But my question is however, why think of something that convoluted fifteen years in advance? She apparently murdered her parents in the first place to \"free herself\", but that result led to her... while she was somehow found not guilty but rather insane, it results in her being stuck in one single room for fifteen years. Of like the two scenes we saw of her parents, they didn't seem like bad people at all. But no, I have to murder my parents, and if I ever have a child of my own, I want her or him to murder their parents as well for some reason. Because you cannot be \"free\" unless you fucking brutally kill your parents.\n \n...Did you know that... apparently MORI Hiroshi receives criticism over... this? These computer jargons?\n\nimg(https://i.imgur.com/kPV5SjB.png)\n \n_In addition, Mori's works, especially The Perfect Insider, is often criticized for the overuse of computer jargons. He responds that it is perfectly natural for people with some background knowledge to have a better understanding than others. According to Mori, computer jargons are not much different from proper nouns, like the names of celebrities or fashion brands, in the sense that they are in most cases just there as ornament that serves to create a particular mood._\n \nYeah, no. I'm willing to believe a huge amount of people, the majority really, are even aware of what hexadecimals are. Just like I'm also willing to believe everybody reviewing this review right now is capable of reading binary. Why else would I just randomly include binary in a review if that wasn't the case?\n \n~~~01001101 01001111 01010010 01001001 00100000 01001000 01101001 01110010 01101111 01110011 01101000 01101001 00100000 01101001 01110011 00100000 01100001 00100000 01100111 01100101 01101110 01101001 01110101 01110011~~~ \n\n...See, like even if you can't perfectly read binary ~~or find a free binary translator online~~, it creates a particular mood!\n \nLet's be honest here. The hexadecimals did manage to create a particular mood. I haven't laughed as hard as I did when Magata and the Professor started to talk about hexadecimals in her virtual reality Lego Block machine in a looooooong time.\n \n___\n \n#Chapter Seven: The Man Himself#\n \nWe're now far past being completely off the rails. Now, we're fully into the \"Wikipedia section\" of the review. As a disclaimer, I just want to say, as a person, MORI Hiroshi is probably a kind enough person in real life and I bare him no genuine ill will. \n\nimg(https://cdn.anilist.co/img/dir/person/reg/5190.jpg)\n\nBut after completing Perfect Insider, and going through his English Wikipedia page\n \n_~~haha seriously using Wikipedia as a source~~_\n \nfor at least some answers to my many, many questions... well, just to say the least, I don't think I have any reason to believe the novel is any better than what this anime presented to me. In a lot of cases, I like to give the original creators the benefit of the doubt. Maybe it's a [farcical representation of twisted versions of his stories or ideas](https://anilist.co/anime/21189/RanpoKitanGameofLaplace), maybe [it reads better or is just a bad adaptation](https://anilist.co/anime/11111/Another), etc. But the impression I got of him as a writer is just...\n \n_~~just want to reiterate, I'm not __seriously__ judging a person via information off of their Wikipedia page BUT~~_\n \nLike if you were curious why I was putting his name like I have been, that's because he insists others do so. And let's be honest here, since I'm completely shitting on both a probably faithful representation of his debut work as a writer and also partly him himself, I should at least put his name the way he insists it be written. While he may be famous for his mystery novels, he considers his status as a craftsman and researcher to be __above__ that of a novelist. _Oh..._\n \nBut well, why did he originally decide to become a writer? Well once, he just joked that he'd just _automatically_ become a writer by the age of forty.  He also has stated he want an additional source of income to help fund the expansion of his miniature garden railway. Additionally, he wanted to impress his daughter who happened to be a fan of mystery novels.\n \n...Look, all those reasons are valid enough to become a novelist. But, if you started writing on a whim or not because specifically you enjoy or want to write good stories, my impression of you as a writer is going to immediately slide a bit. So when \"computer jargons\" come into play in one of your stories, I'm going to be more of the mindset that you were just stringing together complete nonsense to make something completely convoluted. You can bring your knowledge about science and computers into your mystery novels. Hell, that's probably a __great idea!__ But you have to still make it interesting or bare some relevance to the mystery and make it seem like not a gigantic asspull.\n \nLike hexadecimals? That's really what you went with? It clashes so fucking horribly with what we've been shown of this character. She's murdered multiple people bluntly with a knife, has alternate personalities, is a genuinely a sociopath, and this is the clever thing she comes up with, to get away. HEXADECIMALS. OPERATING SYSTEMS. VIRTUAL REALITY LEGO BLOCKS. OVERWRITING VIDEO FILES.\n\nI honestly think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost on par with the idea of trying to tell a story entirely through chicken metaphors.\n \nThen salt is just slammed into my wounds because this is apparently not originally the first novel he wrote about the Professor and Nishi. No, this was the fourth. His editor viewed this however as the most shocking of the four, so it became the first to be published.\n \n...What? Okay, you wrote a series of four novels about these two characters, let's take the very last one and publish it first? So wait, is there an actual introduction in one of the later S&M novels? In the anime, these characters were never introduced. The first episode just starts up, they're in the office and talking, and then they go to the island on a class wide camping trip, and then murder just happens. _What?_\n \nAs someone who has been stuck in writer's block hell for a year or two since writing a shitty self-published thing I did in high school that I don't ever actually want other people to see, there is no other way for me to take someone saying \"oh I finished my novel by just writing every night for like three hours\" other than the way it sounds.\n \nOh, ___writing is so easy!___ In the twenty two years I've been writing, I've written somewhere over thirty mystery novels and countless short stories and all this other stuff, because writing is just ___so easy.___\n \nAlso trust me, I know how this is sounding. And I know as someone who has never actually read (or will read) any of his non-adapted stories, I might be acting a little too harsh.\n \nSo let's turn around and get to the heart of the matter.\n \n___\n \n#Chapter Eight: The Mephisto Prize#\n\nimg(https://i.imgur.com/MymzbpE.png)\n \nThe original novel of Subete ga F ni Naru won an award after being published in 1996, you know. It won the acclaimed Mephisto Prize by the editors of Mephisto Magazine. The award was as well coincidentally, established in 1996. That's a weird coincidence, but whatever, the magazine just happened to start this award and just happened to pick this novel that happened to to be a debut novel of this guy both in the same year...\n \nNo big deal, it was just a coincidence--oh...\n\nimg(https://i.imgur.com/p3eT4gh.png)\n \nSo... MORI Hiroshi's editor has stated that the entire purpose of and reason why the Mephisto Prize was established was so they could give it to MORI Hiroshi for Subete ga F ni Naru to make his debut more sensational. What? _What?_ His editor just came out and _admitted this?_ I mean I'm sure he was a great researcher before he switched to writing, but that doesn't _automatically mean he's going to be a good writer._ How does that not sound sketchy as fuck?\n \n_Okay, this is gonna be your very first published novel, here is an award to draw more attention to it._\n \nTo be fair, since then, the Mephisto Prize has been given to fifty other novels (also it's generally to previously unpublished novels), so it's not like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something that just went away right after kickstarting MORI Hiroshi's thirty novel plus career as a novelist but... like if his editor hadn't apparently said this himself, I would have thought nothing of it.\n \nBut to be fair, starting an entirely new award for Subete ga F ni Naru specifically makes a lot more sense with an ulterior motive. I mean typically anyways, it's not like debut novelists cause a new award to be created. The Edogawa Ranpo Prize, the Bram Stoker Award, etc... obviously, those came after the writers they're named after... and sure, the Mephisto Prize isn't named after MORI Hiroshi but the actual magazine but why would his editor ever think it's a good idea to just throw that out there???\n\n_Oh, it was just to make his initial debut more sensational. No big deal._\n \nIt's just yet another weird footnote on top of everything else connected to this fucking series. \n\n\"It's an __award winning__ novel!!! An adaptation of the __award winning__ novel from MORI Hiroshi!!! Please watch/buy the book!!! ___It won an award!!!___\"\n \n___\n \n#Chapter Nine: The Point of it All#\n \nLet's correct our course here and get back to the series. What... exactly was the point of this series? Or rather, I guess I'm asking, what was the point of this story? This being the fourth story MORI Hiroshi about this Professor and his jealous pouty sidekick made a lot of things make more sense. Perhaps in the other stories the Professor is possibly a bit more proactive or acts interested in the mysteries...? Maybe? Maybe they actually successfully catch the fucking culprit in one of the nine other novels.\n \nBecause like believe me, I am by no means a mystery buff (I've read literally [one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_Then_There_Were_None)). That's just not my primary genre. BUT, I've always thought that the point of reading a mystery was... like you're supposed to be able to take an interest in the characters trying to figure out who did something and then usually, bringing that person to justice. Sure, if the culprit character is a good or interesting character or if the writer intends on having her show up again then them getting away in the end is fine depending on how you do it.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/yEhSvct.png)\n \nBut from the brief descriptions of the other stories they covered in the TV drama, it seemed like the other S&M stories are mostly unrelated. Everything Becomes F, or the ones involving Magata, are like in the middle of the series. So... what was with that ending, then? Magata gets away, but then the show ends with Magata talking with her daughter/her alternate personalities, and then the credits roll, and that's the end. So Magata just gets away and wanders off somewhere else??? What was that ending if not to basically just once and for all fully confirm that Magata is fucking completely insane rather than some genius like the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been treating her?\n\nWas I supposed to be invested in the process of them trying to figure out the mystery and NOT react so negatively when it turned out to be a convoluted pile of garbage? Hexadecimals! Computers! How convoluted the entire thing is just undercut by the fact that this was all just planned in advance. Oh okay, so it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a virus or anything that messed up the operating system and caused the whole actual mystery of the show, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just that Magata knew exactly when she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d need the door to open so she just wrote it into the operating system that she was allowed to design and the facility actually used without checking any of the versions over at all FOR FIFTEEN YEARS.\n\n...Additionally, the show never answered enormously important questions. How exactly did she hack off her dead daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arms and legs? When they went into her room, firstly, it was entirely spotless, and additionally, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see any of the tools that you would probably need to remove a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arms and legs. The show made the point to have her daughter be shown wearing gloves so the daughter didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t leave any fingerprints thus proving that she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Shiki Magata but\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 like you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re telling me right after Magata\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter killed herself, she was just standing there with the hacksaw at the ready, AND NOT A SINGLE DROP OF BLOOD HIT THE GROUND? YOU WANT TO GO INTO FULL DETAIL ABOUT HEXADECIMALS, BUT NO, THESE DETAILS, NO, THEY DON\u00e2\u0080\u0099T MATTER. HEXADECIMALS ARE WHAT MATTER.\n\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not even go into how she could have possibly given birth to a daughter alone with no doctor or anything, and then raised that daughter for fifteen years without somebody finding out. I mean what did she do? Uh yeah, can you go out and buy some baby food and pass it through the door slot? I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, maybe that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s EXACTLY what she did. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually established that she can just have the security people watching over her door buy stuff for her and then just pass it to her through the door slot without questioning why she would want these things.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/FkhuRhY.png)\n \nIf you were to recommend me this series as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgreat\u00e2\u0080\u009d or even \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood\u00e2\u0080\u009d mystery and I took your recommendation seriously and watched it, I think the result would have been I would have never wanted to even come close to the mystery genre ever again if this is an example of a _GOOD_ mystery.\n\nIf that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s out, then\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 was I supposed to care or feel interested in the characters of Professor and Nishi? Or find any of their dialogue interesting or entertaining? I find that hard to believe. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m really not exaggerating when I call him Professor Who Gives a Fuck. He just smokes, shuts down Nishi, and admires and wants to be more like Miss I Killed My Uncle, Parents, and Cut My Daughter Cousin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Arms and Legs Off After She Killed Herself Because of My Actions. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s his entire character.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/sF5lvtO.png)\n\nAnd when they really start to go into the past between Professor and Nishi, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way too fucking late for it to matter. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so late when the reveal happens that it honestly seemed to me like Nishi herself had forgotten this and was remembering it along with the audience, but I think she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supposed to actually remember it? But like the show itself cuts away when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s showing the meeting between her and Magata before the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start where Magata asks her \u00e2\u0080\u009cwell wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there someone standing next to you when you saw your parents fucking die and also why do you love the professor so much that you stalk him\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nLike the mystery was well in progress, but the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still doling out information about the past of our actual two main characters. It felt so nonsensical to me when watching it, but like I said, Everything Becomes F not being the first S&M story makes it make way more sense. Though, now I have to wonder if the story that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually about the death of Nishi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parents and her meeting with the Professor are like the fourth novel since MORI Hiroshi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s editor said \u00e2\u0080\u009chey let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just fuck up the order because this one is more shocking! It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fine! Who cares!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo the characters are awful, the dialogue is awful, the mystery is awful, and basically nothing that mattered was actually brought to any sort of satisfying resolution. Again, I must ask myself\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 what was the point of this show?\n\nI still have no fucking idea. Wait\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 no. That's not true.\n\nThey made\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 a proper adaptation of this guy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original novel for\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 fans of the original novel/series. Which\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 apparently exist somewhere out in the world because how in the hell could he still be writing novels if literally NOBODY read them?\n\nLook, I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t read the novel myself, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m willing to wager that if A-1 Pictures had done any meddling rather than straight up adapting the novel word for word as I believe they did, I think it would have actually done more good than bad. \n\nLike even taking changing the actual mystery or removing hexadecimals off of the table, just\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 like, the Professor and Magata\u00e2\u0080\u0099s discussion in English could have happened off the screen. That is clearly something they took right from the novel that is fucking terrible in actual execution.\n\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really all I have for people looking if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seriously considering watching this. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already a fan of this guy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stories or find them interesting then\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 sure. Otherwise, definitely not, especially if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in search of a satisfying or well written mystery series. But if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re someone like me who can derive entertainment from things I simultaneously view to be as fucking horrible, then I would totally (and did at the very start) recommend this series.\n\nI mean, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve read this far, the effect is somewhat ruined because of the spoilers, but I still strongly recommend it as a fan of entertainingly bad shows. Oh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 did I even mention that the ultimate moment when they confront Magata/THE KILLER and explain the hexadecimals, they do it through the Lego Block virtual reality? And like Magata and the Professor are sitting together on chairs on a Lego Block virtual beach while Nishi is just in some dumpy room yelling out her incorrect conclusions through virtual reality space that the viewer themselves know to be entirely incorrect at this point?\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/RpM8NCt.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/aywhg7s.png)~~~\n\nDid I mention that at this point the police are in the real life world room and working to trace Magata\u00e2\u0080\u0099s access to VIRTUAL REALITY WORLD? There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just so much to unpack and question (in a bad way), that frankly, I personally believe this series is _amazing_.\n\nOh yeah, when the Professor just decides he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spent enough time in the facility after two people have already died and leaves with the intention of getting off the island, he and Nishi are just allowed to go freely.

Perfect Insider\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 as said at the very start of this review, I give it a __1 out of 15__. However, I can probably see why MORI Hiroshi is an acclaimed writer (wow, the mysteries are so complicated and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stuff about computers! __AWARD WINNING NOVEL!!!__) but I can _also_ see why none of his stories have ever once won the Edogawa Ranpo award. Or apparently any other award but the Mephisto Prize, for that matter.\n\nAs I said in the previous section, I would probably only genuinely recommend this series to either fans of MORI Hiroshi or those like me who like watching gruesome and horrific train wrecks unfold before their very eyes. But if the day ever comes that we receive an animated Perfect Insider 2, I'd be fully for watching S&M to get on the case yet again!\n\n_...And fail to catch the culprit, again.

One must ask themselves, why would a studio primarily known for their \"horror\" series ever one day just fucking do a show entirely about talking farts?\n\nBut to pin the blame for Onara Gorou entirely on ICLA would be disingenuous indeed, and I try to be an impartial and fair reviewer, as you may know if you've read any of my previous Korean webtoon reviews. No, we have to look to Onara Gorou's acclaimed director, [Takashi Taniguchi](https://myanimelist.net/people/41284/Takashi_Taniguchi). Who is responsible for several creations that aren't even on Anilist and god help me, I __refuse__ to be the one who adds them here.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/LlNCpil.png)\n\nI personally choose to believe that just one day between Yami Shibai 3 and 4, this madman, Takashi Taniguchi just suddenly showed up one day at ICLA.\n\n_You are the acclaimed creators of Yami Shibai, yes? I want you to help me create this very funny fart show. I will be the director._ ___I have a gun.___ _You're going to help me make this show about talking farts, and_ ___I have a gun,___ _you better help me make this show happen. Or who knows,_ ___this gun may just accidentally happen to go off.___\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/dEWfvwv.png)\n\nThey __definitely__ didn't do it because they genuinely thought it was funny or for money. Yami Shibai is a wonderful series, and [all five seasons are perfect](https://i.imgur.com/Xdyvp6w.png), so I know ICLA is better than... than this.\n\nReally, I have to just underline how much of a psychopath one would have to be to really push for this show's creation. Thirteen episodes about talking farts. Even in the format of a TV short, it gets almost IMMEDIATELY old but yet... _thirteen episodes!_\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/bckBzxY.png)\n\nThere was absolutely no reason for this to be anything more than yet another weird ONA of this Taniguchi guy. I have absolutely no fucking idea which side to blame for this. Did Taniguchi genuinely just want to do a collaboration with this studio that is primarily known for their horror series, with that collaboration ending up being this talking fart show? Did ICLA genuinely want to break out of horror and into the comedy genre?  Like there is straight up a horror episode of this and that made me think, was this idea originally just a scrapped Yami Shibai idea?\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/3BLfF4W.png)\n\nThe farts are talking and living entities, and the people that they are sprouting from are just hollow shells that never once talk. The farts control them. They are hosts to their farts. Then their farts go on to marry other farts, and have families... __of farts!__\n\nAt the end of the day, after all of the farts have subsided, I just have to ask myself. Did anybody involved in this show seriously have any faith in it? That it'd be found funny or received positively at all? And really... the answer I've come to is...\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/YsxFR7Z.jpg)\n\n...Of fucking course not. I can't. I just can't. I refuse to believe otherwise. Literally none of it was funny outside of maybe the horror episode because of how hilariously well it would fit in an actual season of Yami Shibai. In addition, the show just straight up ends with the characters singing to all of the farts making repeated fart noises and a character of course lights a cigarette, and the school explodes and everyone dies. \"Onara Gorou is now over, we're never speaking of this ever again as there'll never be a sequel, now we have to get to work on Yami Shibai 4.\"\n\nIn my opinion, an awful show that was made with the express purpose of making an awful show is automatically worse than any terrible show whose creators actually tried to make a good show but they just horribly failed. So, I give Onara Gorou a __1 out of a 100__. \n\nNow, let's never speak of this ever again and please downvote this review. And I'll see you again inevitably, when ICLA drops Yami Shibai 6.\n\n~~~youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN0RahE0W_Y)~~~\n\n_Did they fucking shoot this in an abandoned building???

At this point, I'm basically voluntarily going along with these stupid experiments. I don't think we need the padded room anymore. Also, all the other experiments took place in the middle of the day.

Who I'm primarily familiar with as the creators of [Seitokai Yakuindomo's anime](https://anilist.co/anime/8675/SeitokaiYakuindomo) and the [Mardock Scramble movies](https://anilist.co/anime/8100/MardockScrambleTheFirstCompression). I do not know what suddenly possessed them or took hold over them one day causing them to create Hand Shakers. Mardock Scramble was of course not an original anime, but I liked almost all three of the movies well enough. At the very least, they were competent.\n\nAnd it should be noted that the director of Hand Shakers, [Shingo Suzuki](https://anilist.co/staff/105132/ShingoSuzuki), while he was certainly involved in the Mardock Scramble movies, he was not director (the [director of Mardock Scramble](https://anilist.co/staff/104856/SusumuKudou) instead went on to direct [Girls Ride Bikes 3](https://anilist.co/anime/21298/MinamiKamakuraKoukouJoshiJitenshaBu)). Not... that the full blame for Hand Shakers should even fully be directly placed upon him anyways. I personally believe that it was a team effort, and the result being one of the best horrible series I've ever seen.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/ND6iSGL.gif)\n\nNo other show can I simultaneously describe as be visually nauseous but somewhat entertaining. Like even when the camera movements aren't absolutely completely insane, there is usually just so much shit happening on the screen at the same time that it's ridiculous. Say whatever you wish about Hand Shakers. But this show is fucking unique. For better or for worse, I have never seen a show quite like this. And it works out kind of, because I can't genuinely say I was ever bored throughout the show.\n\nIt's unfortunate that the core story I guess is... more on the generic side. The main characters who are Hand Shakers have to fight a bunch of people to survive and also possibly eventually go on to meet and battle God to bring about whatever they wish of him.\n\n...Okay, maybe it's not THAT generic, but... eh. I won't outright spoil it beyond the following tag but, ~!they never actually meet and battle God despite that supposedly being the whole thing of the show.!~\n\n___\n\n#H-35: The Hand Shakers#\n\nOkay, so they're called Hand Shakers because their power is essentially triggered by two people holding hands while possessing a similar goal or etc. That's understandable enough. Why are their weapons called Nimrods? No, really. Why are they called Nimrods? Why is the \"Hand Shaker realm\" for the lack of a better word to describe what it is, called Ziggurat? I know the Hand Shakers speech that is done repeatedly throughout the show makes mention of Babel but...\n\nWhatever! Fine! They're just purposely trying to be weird to make it more unique! Got it!\n\nThere are numerous different pairs of Hand Shakers throughout the show and... a lot of them are just straight up cliches, but there is at least one that is unique while also being a cliche.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/0pRchZ6.png)\n\nWe have the pair of main characters who are... well, they're the main characters! I really have nothing to say about Tazuna other than I guess I kind of wished they had done more with the aspect of his dead sister. ~~That was certainly a sentence I just typed.~~ Like that could have been a bigger thing than it was. But Tazuna's dead sister is more or less treated as a footnote? Like she gets brought up again at the end and I had forgotten that Tazuna had a sister at all by that point. Also, I don't know why they continually tried to push catchphrases on the Hand Shakers. Especially Tazuna. \"It meshes! It'll mesh!\" Please stop.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/0sBjYl8.png)\n\nKoyori, I think I actually liked more when she was mute? I mean it was actually interesting. Tazuna keeps protecting this mute girl and holding her hand so she doesn't die and while it's clear that she still has emotions and etc, she can't vocally express herself. But there was obviously that anticipation for when she actually would finally speak, and then when it happens... it's just treated as... \"oh, she can talk now\" by basically every other character. And also her character entirely shifts into \"I'll protect Tazuna\" after that point. Eh.\n\nThen we get to the Hand Shakers that Tazuna and Koyori fights throughout the show and oh boy.\n\nFirst, you have the sadist and the masochist.\nThen, you have the little girl boss and adult employee.\nThen, you have the card game playing brother and sister (by blood) who romantically love each other.\nThen, you have THE IDOL WHO FIGHTS VIA SINGING (but she also has a sword) AND THROWS QUOTES FROM HISTORICAL AND INFLUENTIAL FIGURES OUT WILLY NILLY AND HER MANAGER WHO HAS A DOUBLE BLADED LIGHT SABER STRAIGHT OUT OF STAR WARS THAT EVEN MAKES THE LIGHT SABER SWOOSH NOISES.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/g1R9cgg.png)\n\nThen, finally, you have the glasses guy and spoiler.\n\n...Can I just say it's straight up fucking bizarre that the idol character felt more like the final fight than the actual final fight did? Like they even do a whole flashback episode to set up the final fight, and Tazuna meets the final fight character way before earlier in the show. But Tazuna and Koyori are straight up in a way worse dire situation against the idol character who is just singing on top of a ferris wheel at one point with her manager.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/SuNCh4z.png)\n\nThe final fight guy straight up says in his dialogue, \"I'm stronger and in a better league than the idol character!\", but then they straight up just kick his ass. It's not even like glasses guy was doing that poorly against them, but there's just a point in the fight where with absolutely no reason why, Tazuna and Koyori straight up just fully overpower and essentially defeat him. Like oh okay. The idol character straight up hurt Tazuna so badly that he was fucking wounded and he left his house with Koyori in hand after screaming at his parents dramatically because he was gonna go take the fight to the idol character.\n\nBut the idol character just kicks his ass again until Koyori finally steps in. Also, the idol character bafflingly was the most unique of the five Hand Shaker pairs they fight against. I actually kind of loved it when we're shown that the whole time, she had like a little notebook that has all of the stupidly out of nowhere quotes she occasionally throws out written down in.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/2kzUjL8.png)\n\n___\n\n#H-35: You have to see it to believe it#\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/6HiRy93.png)\n\nWhat I primarily drew my enjoyment from was of course the action scenes and generally just... how the scenes were done in general. Because as a person who enjoys watching weird or bad shows where it's really easy to question almost every creative decision they made, this show is fascinating.\n\n\"Okay, we're going to have a simple character moment where Koyori cries over an injured Tazuna because she feels helpless and unable to help Tazuna who keeps getting hurt for her sake.\"\n\n\"So what, she's just going to cry over him? This is boring. We have to spice it up! MAKE THE CAMERA GO THIS WAY, THEN THAT WAY, AND ALL AROUND HER AS THIS COMPLETELY MUTE CHARACTER CRIES.\"\n\nyoutube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZn9ueRnzPY)\n\nDon't even fuck with me. That moment would have been way more fucking effective if the camera had just remained stable and in place. There's another similar moment when Tazuna is talking with the guy who inevitably turns out to be the \"final fight guy\", and while they're talking, the camera starts to move up. And it like it comes back down to show Tazuna/the final fight guy, but it's upside down.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/bv98SYv.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/06rWLJc.png)~~~\n\nEverything in my brain was screaming why. Why would you do that? That had to have been a conscious decision someone made. _Why?_ I mean I guess it served its purpose, because since the camera did that bullshit, I honestly thought that the glasses character was in fact actually \"God\" and that's how he knew Tazuna. I was wrong, but it did turn out that he's of the final Hand Shakers they fight, so whatever.\n\nI can't really describe most of the action scenes well enough to do them justice here. You really do genuinely have to see it to believe it. Like there's the whole weird visual effect the Ziggurat has on the world in general with fish moving across skyscrapers and all that nonsense, but then the actual action scenes is just explosions, dust clouds, Hand Shaker magic bullshit effects flying everywhere, and disgusting shaky and insane camera movements going everywhere.\n\nIt's amazing.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/svkjRNO.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/aWtzGl5.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/DaCwcVi.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/sTx2OuN.png)~~~\n\n___\n\n#H-35: Conclusion#\n\nHand Shakers is sort of amazing. I actually genuinely sort of love this show as far as a show I'm giving a score of __2 out of 10__ goes. It's absolutely horrible, but I actually found myself enjoying bits and pieces of it, and even the scenes that were especially nausea inducing. Which I guess just goes to show you that you can in fact enjoy something you simultaneously think is fucking horrible. Because I hate to admit this, but I'd probably watch Hand Shakers again sometime down the line.\n\nThat's gross. But I just can't bring myself to hate this show in the same way I've hated several of the other shows I've reviewed. Yeah, that's about it. It's a pretty good horrible show that I'd totally recommend to watch. _I personally recommend watching Hand Shakers._\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/UOs42wC.png)\n\n___\n\n\"Alright, now can you please just fucking drop the knife now?\"\n\n_You answered literally none of my questions.

Usually at worst, endings leave themes or plot points unresolved, which makes them unsatisfying. This rarity makes *Occult Academy*'s absolute traincrash in its final three episodes all the more astounding and almost impressive in its sudden derailment of what made the prior 10 at all worth watching.\n\nIf you wonder why I'm leading with that, it's because OA's ending really does retroactively corrupt the viewing experience to that degree. Let's get the good points out of the way, because they do exist and in fact are almost plentiful in the first two thirds of the series; Maya, our protagonist, is not a particularly *deep* character, but for the show's first part she manages to be magnetic by sheer force of personality, and plays off her supporting cast extremely well, and there is an ongoing implication that the school's vice principal (and her bodyguard, a knockoff of Gomez from *Birdy The Mighty*) might be up to something sinister. The show's first ten episodes nominally revolve around the presence of time traveler Fumiaki and the hunt for something called the Nostradamus Key, an artifact that must be retrieved before a certain date, or the world will end. In actuality, they're fairly self-contained, small story arcs usually lasting one or two episodes. These center around all kinds of unusual phenomena, from attacks by mothman-like creatures to supporting character Kozue having an induced near-death experience and it altering her personality. The highlight of these--and it's not even close--is the last, centering on a ghost girl named Akari being finally put to rest after having frozen to death as a child. This arc, comprising episodes 9 and 10, is genuinely moving, and had the show ended here--without ever resolving its background plot--OA would probably be sitting somewhere atop a 70-odd, like many shows I and many other people have seen that are solid and have a few highlight episodes, but aren't anything groundbreaking.\n\nThen, like a trio of kicks to the stomach, come episodes 11, 12, and unlucky 13. Each of these is bad enough on its own but combined, they form a full-on assault on every existing point the show had in its favor. This begins with Fumiaki's sort-of girlfriend Mikaze, a genuinely sweet girl who was part of an ongoing B-plot, namely that she was causing Fumiaki to split his time helping Maya find the Nostradamus Key. This was a conflict, yes, but it was never presented as a major one, and there is zero hint that Mikaze herself is anything but well-meaning and possibly a bit ditzy. Episode 11 *begins* with her attempting to outright seduce Fumiaki to *kill* Maya, and appears to reveal that she is part of some sort of cult who wants Maya dead and the titular academy destroyed. This is the first of many, *many* ill-thought-out plot twists that embody all the worst preconceived notions about the device. The very worst Shyamalan film has never packed a one-two as bad as \"Mikaze is part of a cult! No actually she's an *actual evil sorceress* controlling the cult!\" These revelations come so quickly after each other--and in the midst of so many others--that they rapidly lose even pure shock factor, \"what the fuck?!\"s rapidly fading into dejected \"ughs\" as the episodes roll on, and then start to drag on. The \"sinister\" vice principal is revealed to be a white mage (read: magical girl straight out of *Nanoha*, despite being in her 30s), Maya's father's notebook is revealed to be a magical talisman. The vice principal's bodyguard is a demon who can transform into a winged panther. It just goes on and on like this, piling idiotic left turn onto idiotic left turn until it starts chasing its own narrative tail.\n\nThe real insidious bit here is not these problems, which are obvious upon even a cursory viewing, but the fact that they rob Maya of so much of her agency. Maya, as said earlier, is not a terribly deep protagonist, and she doesn't even fit--even in the early part of the series--the conventional definition of \"strong female character\". She's not very nuanced and most of the conflict in the story revolves around her dead father (spoiler: at the end of the series it is revealed that he is in fact, not dead), but for the story's first two-thirds she has *oomph.* She's physically capable, she drops monsters left and right with the help of axes, crossbows (more than once!), and even simple sticks, she's loud and uncompromising, and in general is in charge. These twists make her a pawn of Mikaze's cult, then the vice principal, and then, finally, in what is undeniably the worst of these, Fumiaki. At the end of episode 13, in a final punch to the jaw, it's revealed that Maya and a young incarnation of Fumiaki from the present instead of the future, despite a fairly big age difference, end up getting together. That they could not leave well enough alone even *this* sickeningly overdone clich\u00c3\u00a9, as rich in simple boringness as it is heteronormative \"and he gets the girl\" bullshit, is the final nail in the coffin for what is a terrible, ***terrible*** ending to a show that begins so well. \n\nI rarely am so vulgar and so referential to my own scoring in my anilist reviews. I try to maintain a pseudo-professional tone and to talk about what shows do right or at least do interestingly. But in *Occult Academy* all of that is overridden by one of the worst ending arcs I've ever seen in the medium. I sometimes end reviews with a recommendation. Instead, I will end this one with quite the opposite.

Who brought us things such as [Ranpo Kitan](https://anilist.co/anime/21189/RanpoKitanGameofLaplace) and [Kino 2017](https://anilist.co/anime/98448/KinonoTabitheBeautifulWorldtheAnimatedSeries)... and Classroom of Elite is even directed by the [same guy who directed Ranpo Kitan](https://anilist.co/staff/101909/SeijiKishi) ~~(actually, it's listed as having [two directors](https://anilist.co/staff/118960/HiroyukiHashimoto))~~.\n\n...Which is kind of surprising, because at least Ranpo Kitan had a clearer and more logical plot, and things actually happened. But again, Classroom of Elite is an adaptation of a series of novels so whatever.\n\n...I honestly have no fucking clue what genre I'd even call it. Looking at its Anilist page, it's under comedy, romance, and drama. Comedy...? No? Romance? Definitely no. Drama? Fuckin'... they WISH.\n\nI felt like most of the time this show had me [at knifepoint screaming at me like an insane person.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF0a6EZ_5v8) _You have to care!_ __YOU HAVE TO CARE!__ ___THIS IS DRAMATIC, THESE EVENTS THAT ARE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE IMPORTANT AND YOU MUST FIND THEM IMPORTANT.___ Please care that this idiotic and completely and almost comically unlikable punk is about to get expelled from school!\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/GhJKYMb.png)\n\nBut... but I don't. I just don't give a flying fuck about this character. Or any of the other characters, for that matter. There is nothing to cheer these characters on for, there are no stakes, and nothing that happens is interesting or entertaining in any way. As a matter of fact, it's honestly almost shocking how over the top this show is while simultaneously being full of nothing. But I'll get into that. There's gonna be a whole fucking section of this review that discusses that.\n\n__If you care about getting spoiled on this series, then I guess... this is the point where I warn you about that but... why would you care?__ Nobody cares. Like thinking about it now that I've completed it, there is absolutely nothing about this series I'm interested in. Like the \"plot\" or the point of the series was very much unresolved but there's just nothing? Why ever make a season two for this? Why even read the original series after watching the anime?\n\nLike you should actually want the viewer to be interested in seeing a continuation of the story whether it be through a possible season two or just getting them to look at the original. This show even ends like on a \"OH SHIT WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED\" type of note but...\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/8CeAF8W.png)\n\n__NOTHING OF NOTE HAPPENED IN ALL TWELVE EPISODES.__ _YOU [GLASSLIP](https://anilist.co/anime/20645/Glasslip)'D ME, YOU ABSOLUTE SHITHEELS._\n\n___\n\n#Characters#\n\nAt least this section will be quick, because there's only one character that matters or is worth even discussing to any length beyond like a sentence or two.\n\nimg300(https://i.imgur.com/KicD8lM.png)\n\nYou have Main Girl, she is a loner and will repeatedly state that she is a loner and prefers being a loner despite showing signs that hint otherwise. Oh, and her only motivation is that she wants her brother's approval. That's it.\n\nimg300(https://i.imgur.com/UUSpSyt.png)\n\nYou have Other Girl 1, she is super nice to everyone and wishes to be friends with everyone on the planet and _there is definitely nothing at all wrong with her in any way shape or form despite the fact that she was placed in the worst class of the school._\n\nimg300(https://i.imgur.com/PtQvV5x.png)\n\nYou have Other Girl 2, she is shy girl but she has a different side to her that she keeps secret and her purpose in this show is _to almost be raped by a creepy mall employee_ and then she shows at a trial a couple of photos I guess and then after that she's a character from that point on.\n\nimg300(https://i.imgur.com/HDDs2n7.png)\n\nYou have Delinquent Failure. He is a delinquent failure who gets into fights and arguments and he wishes to play the basketball but if he gets expelled he can no longer play the basketball but despite this he doesn't care about studying and keeping his position in school secure so he can play the basketball that he so dearly loves ~~and he is a REAL FULL FLEDGED CHARACTER THAT YOU SHOULD CARE ABOUT.~~\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/g9NHOse.png)\n\nYou have the Teacher. She is harsh and at one point calls the failure class garbage, but then eventually at some point she apparently cares about or wants to get her class to the top of the garbage pyramid. It just sort of happens. She seemed like she could have cared less before then, but whatever, who needs clear motivations for characters anyways???\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/f9BSHPi.png)\n\nThen we have the main male character, Kiyotaka Ayanokouji. I'm saying it right now, but Ayanokouji is the only character in this entire show, in this entire series that is worth anything at all. It was actually somewhat interesting or entertaining at how ridiculously far they took it. This character is absolutely completely emotionless the entire way through, and does not care about ANYTHING. And even at the end of the show when Main Girl ~!actually finally changes and starts showing emotions!~ for once, Ayanokouji is just staring at her and ~!she eventually gets tuned out by Ayanokouji's inner monologue about how he just does not give a fuck about anyone and all other human beings are just tools to be used. This was actually my favorite moment and one of the few scenes I actually liked out of the entire fucking show.!~ Like wow, I have to give them credit. They, or rather the original author I guess, set out to create one of the most unlikeable characters I've ever seen, and for at least what they adapted, they didn't flip flop on it.\n\nAyanokouji's facial expression is basically entirely the same throughout all twelve episodes. He's never angry, he's never sad, he's never surprised, he never laughs, he is simply Ayanokouji. \n\nHe has absolutely no problem from having someone smear mud into Main Girl's hair so she has to bathe to purposely intensify her sickness or even committing arson. Fuck it, who cares. He just wants to have an ordinary high school life but simultaneously he's going to win at all costs. Win at what, you may ask? I don't know man. _The universe._\n\nAyanokouji will win against _the entire universe because he is perfect and flawless in every single way._\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/d1VUviQ.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/TVrQFF7.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/1zX7hTZ.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/mAwKjaF.png)~~~\n\n_But TGG, isn't being an emotionless husk that wants to only be perceived as an average guy by everyone else Ayanokouji's fla--_\n\n___\n\n#Over the top drama#\n\nIt's impossible not to make the comparison now that I've realized both shows aired in the exact same season (Summer 2017). Classroom of the Elite and [Kakegurui](https://anilist.co/anime/98314/Kakegurui) are both shows that are very over the top about schools that for a multitude of reasons, would never ever exist in real life. But there is a very key difference between these two shows. I mean hell, Kakegurui even has a never losing protagonist, just like Classroom of the Elite.\n\n~~~img220(https://i.imgur.com/Gj8GZOu.png) img220(https://i.imgur.com/osiNg6Y.jpg)~~~\n\n_~~I didn't watch Classroom of the Elite while it was airing because I was too busy watching Kakegurui.~~_\n\nIn Kakegurui, horrible things can happen as a result of the gambles. At the very least, you may go into debt and be forced to essentially be a boot licking slave to one of the other students or you may have the rest of your life beyond graduation basically decided by another. It's very, very over the top, but it is _rightfully_ and for that matter _enjoyably_ over the top.\n\nWhat are the stakes in Classroom of the Elite? You may not have a perfect choice of whatever college or job you wish to end up at. Oh. So why is everything presented so fucking dramatically and over the top? Like very early on, the show establishes that the monthly money given to students is determined by merit, and the bottom class which the show is focused on, Class D, very quickly ends up dropping down to earning zero points ~~because they're all failures~~.\n\nI was under the assumption that the points would matter. But the show makes a point of showing that the stores at least offer a couple of free items to students who have ran out of or wasted their points. Even later in the show, it's shown that there essentially is a free menu for the cafeteria. \n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/GSovS6f.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/CxzG0TK.png)~~~\n\nAfter all, _it IS still a school._ It wouldn't be ___realistic___ if the school was allowing students to starve as a result of their own poor choices or just generally because they're failures.\n\n_Meanwhile, in Kakegurui:_\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/qiFZiuH.gif)\n\nLike honestly. It's treated so goddamned dramatically when the Delinquent Failure is about to be expelled as a result of failing the exam that he refused time and time again to study for but. Like the moment Ayanokouji got up and followed the Teacher out of the classroom, I immediately went: \"Oh okay, so the delinquent isn't going to be expelled.\" And of course, he wasn't.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/YiO5QRR.png)\n\nBut like the way they save him from getting expelled is by selling the Teacher their points because the first thing she told them about this school was that anything could be bought. But... but the [points DON'T MATTER](https://youtu.be/9KAGwNtI26w?t=18s) AND NOTHING WAS FORCING HER TO SELL THEM THE TEST POINT. And Ayanokouji and Main Girl selling the Teacher their money points for the single test point Delinquent Failure needs so he isn't expelled doesn't matter either. In fact, it's like after that the points just completely cease mattering entirely. How is the majority of Class D faring as a result of having wasted most of their points and most likely getting no or very little points in the next month? Who cares!\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/jV6nmxH.png)\n\nLike when Other Girl 1 is suddenly revealed to be hiding a super dark personality beneath her smiley and friendly facade? That doesn't matter. Because even after that when she's alone with Ayanokouji, she just talks in the \"nice girl\" persona except for like two times when she actually drops it again. What was the point of threatening him that she'd blackmail him with _rape_ if he ever told anyone else? He basically didn't even care upon discovering it in the first place.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/ERcrRcg.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/kTdtTFr.png)~~~\n\nOr what about Other Girl 2. Her initial role or purpose in the show is basically to have been the witness to Delinquent Failure's innocence when some other students from Class C provoked a fight with him but... her testimony barely influences the result at all. And like they show like one of her modeling pictures off of her camera's SD card but... she didn't have to keep that photo on there when they would use it to show the actual relevant pictures. \n\nThen after that, she just almost gets raped by the creepy weird mall employee guy. But hey, Ayanokouji saves her. And then... and then she's just a character. A part of the main cast. _Whatever!_\n\nThen like in the final arc of the show, where the school has all four classes go and stay at this deserted island for a week, there is like a fight scene between Main Girl and one of the other girls from one of the other classes and it... it literally came out of nowhere. But violence isn't allowed! But theft isn't allowed! The other character just outright says the rules don't matter as long as nobody sees. Oh... so... none of that mattered at all. Okay.\n\nimg(https://i.imgur.com/Vh36GZQ.png)\n\n_Wait, isn't Other Girl 1's whole thing that she'll tell everyone that Ayanokouji raped her, but nobody was around to see nor was she recording her forcing him to grope her. But then in this instance, the show says it doesn't matter if nobody sees--oh just... nevermind. Fuck it!_\n\nBut like there was also an incident where somebody stole a girl's underwear and it causes a schism between the boys and the girls of Class D and like the boyfriend/leader character is all like, I'll accept possession of the stolen underwear because she's my girlfriend I guess and that'll lessen the impact? But I don't think they ever actually reveal that he's in possession of the missing underwear because that's when Ayanokouji says fuck this, I'm just going to set our SURVIVAL MANUAL ON FIRE BECAUSE REASONS AND I'M MANIPULATING A VERY CONVOLUTED SERIES OF EVENTS FROM BEHIND THE SCENES.\n\nThe show ends with Class D, almost entirely as a result of Ayanokouji's capability of manipulation, beating all three other classes. And while they weren't purposely attacking Class B because they have an alliance with them, Ayanokouji's manipulations factored in Class B getting fucked over as well, just not directly by Class D.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/ds3IAYp.png)\n\nSo... Ayanokouji is basically perfect, and no other student is even close to matching him. There maybe actually is one, but in the context of what they adapted, she is on the screen maybe like three or four times and is purposely absent from the final arc of the show. ~~And I'm sure in the novels, Ayanokouji just beats her anyways.~~\n\nAnd the show ends like it's ending on this grandiose note of a cliffhanger like... like you're supposed to be interested in seeing Class D continuing to rise against the higher classes to become the Classroom of the Elite. But... you just don't. Like I said at the start of this review, there's absolutely no motivation to ever actually want to see a continuation of this series. Whereas comparatively, I'm totally down for [Kakegurui 2](https://anilist.co/anime/100876/Kakegurui2) because while that protagonist also basically never loses, the show actually manages to be entertaining.\n\nWhich is something this show repeatedly time and time again fails at.\n\n___\n\n#Filler, Fan service, and Garbage#\n\nI shouldn't even be wasting the time but I should at least address it.\n\nThe Delinquent Failure should not have had four episodes revolving around him. Especially considering after that, he's essentially just nothing but a supporting character. And one of the most minor ones, at that. Like Other Girl 1 keeps going on and on about how Main Girl should not want Deliqnuent Guy to be expelled but...\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/xuA0xge.png)\n\nMain Girl was completely right? He's a fucking failure and none of them should have went anywhere near as far as they did to save him from getting expelled. If he wanted to play basketball and him playing basketball depended on him staying in the school, then maybe his brain should have worked and he would have realized that perhaps actually studying on his own volition would be a good idea.\n\nBut even then after he is essentially dragged into caring about it and after they get the old test questions, he STILL fails. And then after that whole ordeal, they right away start up a new arc where Class C tries to frame Delinquent Failure for assaulting three people and the punishment is... ___BEING SUSPENDED FROM SCHOOL!___ And then when the student council president gets involved, he's like...\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/a1ps8Hx.png)\n\n\"I'M PUTTING EXPULSION ON THE TABLE.\"\n\n_I could probably do an entire breakdown of all of the terrible logic or just everything just generally horribly wrong in that trial scene, but I just do __NOT__ care._\n\nWho... who fucking cares? Again, that image of the show screaming and armed with a knife comes to mind because like... it really seems like they want the viewer to care. But I can't even comprehend caring about anything that happens in this series. How can I when like...\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/DQDYk9H.png)\n\nThe very first episode ends with the shocking reveal that things aren't exactly like they seem at this school. The classes compete and if you're garbage, you don't get points that are essentially money but also simultaneously don't matter, and their Teacher outright tells them all this and that they're garbage ~~which I should note is very, very true~~.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/uIBJexn.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/rgK6Mv3.png)~~~\n\nBut immediately, the second episode just opens with them in pool class. And for several minutes, they're just doing pool class things, but eventually like a switch was flipped, and then they start like having a strategy meeting and going over what their Teacher revealed to them in the prior episode. \"Gosh, who knew there was gonna be a darker turn to this school!\"\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/Y7zX5iR.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/dxg0Fak.png)~~~\n\nAnd the entirety of episode seven is just outright a pool episode. Which I mostly just skimmed through because at the time, I just was _not having any of that shit_. But the show sure showed me, because then the entirety of episode eight is just a __boat vacation__. Granted, the boat trip at least leads into the deserted island arc, but did the boat trip really need to be an entire episode? Or rather, did we need the pool episode when you could basically squeeze as much fan service (and they basically did) into a boat trip episode???\n\nDid there need to be a blond guy character whose entire purpose was to be arrogant, annoying, and completely useless? Like he tags along with Ayanokouji and Other Girl 2 at some point in the Deserted Island arc and he's like swinging from trees and shit and then he gets too far ahead of them, and then the episode just ends with him going back to the boat therefore penalizing the entirety of Class D.\n\nI'm so glad that was the contribution his entire character gave to the show.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/0C19cqZ.png)\n\nLike I just don't understand it. You have this over the top concept and idea, but like... for twelve episodes, basically nothing happens. I mean, I'm willing to believe that the original novel series is probably more or less the exact same. But like... why. Why create a series where absolutely nothing happens? Like it's maybe one thing if you're just throwing a bunch of chickens and metaphors around. But Glasslip isn't a novel series. This is.\n\nBased off of episode one, I imagined like the students were gonna have to start bartering or like trying to earn points. Then the whole angle of competing with the other classes was thrown out there, and I was like oh okay, then we're gonna go in that direction. But it's not like until the last five or so episodes of the show where they actually start competing with the other classes and even then, Ayanokouji just wins. He just wins.\n\nimg(https://i.imgur.com/kGrF7vu.png)\n\n___\n\n#Conclusion#\n\nNo stakes at all, basically no motivation at all, nothing of any note happens, and it's not entertaining. Classroom of the Elite? More like Classroom of the FAILURES! HA! Ha... ha...\n\n~~I really wish I hadn't watched this show.~~\n\nBut uh yeah no, I give this show a __1.5 out of 10__ or a __15 out of 100__. \n\nI would never recommend anyone to seriously watch this show and I hope it doesn't get a second season because if it does I'll be forced to watch it because I actually genuinely like Ayanokouji for how absolutely absurdly unlikable he is. And even as far as masochism/watching bad shows for the sake of watching bad shows go, I'd say Glasslip is a way more interesting show in which also absolutely nothing of note happens.\n\nSo yeah, go watch [Glasslip](https://anilist.co/anime/20645/Glasslip) instead. Or [Kakegurui](https://anilist.co/anime/98314/Kakegurui), I guess. Or anything.\n\nJust not _this._\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/a1xKrxW.png)"}, {"id": 2408, "score": 0, "body": "Saddest, happiest, calmest and intriguing would not summarize the anime in their domain. The anime was really interesting with different characters embellished with different aspects and representing different attributes of life. Each episode with a message and lesson to convey.\n Representing the life of two orphaned brothers and how they are supported and elevated by the people working in the society is something to inculcate in every society. The same way the saddest of the themes and scenes were balanced with happiest moment that came from interacting with the individuals around the characters and making friends with them. The best thing is the friends are also based on the criteria of helping each other and trying to relieve others from the problems they have in their lives. \nThe character of __Kamitani __and __Taka kun__, specially Taka kun was so appealing and pleasing in every aspect. The way one wanted love of his elder brother but the other was too tsundere to show the love. The method that Taka kun used in order to gain the attention and play with Kamitani and the way Taka kun cried when Kamitani did not hit him in response was something unexpected and unusual. Contrasting the two characters and their behaviour with the indifferent but possessive of __Ryo __character of __Kotarou__ and Ryo being over worried over his little brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s needs. __Saikwa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s__ character even though it was not portrayed for a longer duration but the time he made others feel about his personality was totally something that had the feeling of comedy within that body of serious attitude. He never treats Kotarou as a human rather he is an animal precisely a cat for him to play and control. He used Ryo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drawing to control Kotarou when Ryou wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t home to take care of Kotarou which was ludicrous. The notion of making boys as baby sitters portrayed the unconventional role and the display of the fact that boys can be patient if they want to be patient. They can take care of the young ones and siblings while on the other had Yuri\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character showed that it is okay for girls to be not good with children. It is not something to die over if one is lacking one or two things in life. Life is enough to learn, adapt and adjust. The last episodes were filled with emotions and there were so many scenes where one could feel the internal individual crying and weeping over the situation but the equilibrium is maintained through introducing such good, considerate and helping friends and individuals. Overall the anime was a total success on my part."}, {"id": 2418, "score": 1, "body": "Black Clover is a Japanese fantasy shounen manga series, which was written and illustrated by Yuuki Tabata. The series is published in Shueisha's Weekly Shounen Jump magazine in Japan, and Viz Media is publishing it in their Weekly Shonen Jump digital anthology magazine in the US.  At the Black Clover Jump Festa event on December 18, 2016, an anime television series adaptation by Pierrot was announced. It is directed by Tatsuya Yoshihara, with Kazuyuki Fudeyasu writing scripts, Itsuko Takeda doing character designs, and Minako Seki composing the music. The anime premiered on October 3, 2017.The series was initially listed as running for 13 episodes, but was later expanded to 51 episodes, which is one of the mistakes this review will center on, but later about it.\n\nAsta, a kid living in poverty is determined to become the next Wizard King of his country. The problem is, in the world where magic is everything: it determines your position in society, Asta has absolutely no magic at all. However, his determination to become top 1 in the kingdom helps him get into the kingdom's elite defense forces, the Magic Knights. He, together with his brother, start their journey to become the most respected, as well as the kingdom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most powerful man. \n\nHow one should assess a story-line that crawls with clich\u00c3\u00a9s and unoriginality?  While it is not a bad thing, it is not a good thing either. Many anime series have done this before, but the problem here is that putting all these overused clich\u00c3\u00a9s together is a very difficult thing to pull, because you will have to get rid of these clich\u00c3\u00a9s and make your work original. There should always be something your viewers will remember you for. Black Clover, however, does have originality about its story-line, but it is not enough to call its story-line original. Those who are not new to the industry will have a \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have seen this already\u00e2\u0080\u0099 feeling, when watching Black Clover. And at some point it gets somewhat annoying, because you already know what is going to happen. Of course, it is not the only negative side this anime has, there are far too many, I would like to touch upon another thing, which ruined this series. As I have already mentioned in the first paragraph of my review, the series was initially listed as running for 13 episodes, but was later expanded to 51 episodes. This is the biggest mistake this anime has made: you are being shows far too many unnecessary details and nothing really happens. Black Clover has only enough material for 13 episodes. With 13 episodes it would not be that bad as it is right now. \n\nFor any anime that has magic as its main theme, I would hope for a simply flawless, charming animation that will make my heart stop beating for a second. Black Clover\u00e2\u0080\u0099s animation is sometimes fluid and dynamic, but it happens not as often as one would love to see. Indeed, the dark color schemes of the animation help promote the idea of the type of the world full of darkness and evil, and it is really awesome, however, character designs leave much to be desired. There is also nothing to comment on the sound. It does not have any memorable music pieces and voice acting is just\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 listen to Asta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice actor and you will know. It is like you want to relax and you constantly hear \u00e2\u0080\u0098Leeroooooy Jenkiiiins\u00e2\u0080\u0099, which drives you mad. \n\nTo my big disappointment there is nothing original about any character in this anime, even supporting characters are full of clich\u00c3\u00a9s. The main duo of this anime resembles Dragneel Natsu and Fullbuster Gray: their design, their ideals, their attitude towards each other, they are very similar. And not only do the main characters have clich\u00c3\u00a9s, but also the whole supporting character cast: there is absolutely nothing original about them.  Imagine Dragneel Natsu constantly screaming with no reason, imagine Kamijou, Touma ability to nullify magic, and finally imagine Luffy, wanting to become the pirate king. Bingo, that is the whole concept of Black Clover. \n\nAwful, what a disappointment! Even after 27 episodes this series is still bad. As it has already been mentioned many times in my review, there should have never been 51 episodes; this anime has enough material for 7-11 episodes. Okay, even 13 episodes will do. But, for some reason, the creator decided to make it 51 episodes. In result, most of the time you are being shown some absolutely pointless and unnecessary scenes, with jokes that are just dramatic because of the fact that they are absobloodylutely not funny. On top of that, this series is absolutely unoriginal; it has bloody nothing to offer its viewer. However, this anime is great for kids and for those who are totally fine with clich\u00c3\u00a9s and are able to literally \u00e2\u0080\u0098turn their consciousness off.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 This is a number one quality to watch and to finish this anime. I, alack, do not have it and I will have to give up on it after watching the 27th episode today. \n\nAll in all, I am sad to give this anime such a low overall score, but I have not found anything good, anything original about it that will help me appreciate this series, there is nothing good about it. If you want a good battle-shounen, Hunter x Hunter, One Piece, and Fullmetal Alchemist are ready to help you. Black Clover, however, is nothing but a guide on what you should not do to make a good battle-shounen. \n\nGrade-\nOverall (sub): 1\nStory: 1\nAnimation: 5\nArt: 6\nMusic: 5\nVoice acting: 7\nEnjoyment: 2"}, {"id": 2419, "score": 5, "body": "_Today, we're starting a new experiment with Subject T-33.

But the man (the [Junji Nishimura](https://anilist.co/staff/101837/JunjiNishimura) to this [Glasslip](https://anilist.co/anime/20645/Glasslip), if you will) at the heart of Charlotte is none other than [Jun Maeda](https://anilist.co/staff/97347/JunMaeda). Jun Maeda is a co-founder of [Key](https://anilist.co/staff/97885/Key) and the original creator of [Angel Beats!](https://anilist.co/anime/6547/AngelBeats). Angel Beats! apparently is/was super and massively popular.\n\n_[I personally have not watched it, though.](https://anilist.co/activity/11122539)_\n\nIt's probably safe to assume that if it hadn't been massively popular, then obviously, Jun Maeda wouldn't have been able to get Charlotte made. Because apparently Jun Maeda had the idea for Charlotte somewhere deep within the dark recesses of his reptilian mind even before Angel Beats! happened. \n\nDid he have the entire story in his head at that point? Did he change his mind on stuff? Or was it just a bunch of nonsense that he was throwing at the wall and seeing what stuck? Even now, I honestly just don't know. Writing this review is partially an attempt in figuring it out. Because... like alright, let me start with trying to just accurately describe what this show even is.\n\nCharlotte is a comedy/drama series about teenagers developing strange and mysterious superhuman abilities and all the woe that comes from just having these abilities or foolishly abusing them. But the thing with Charlotte is that over the span of its thirteen episodes, there are numerous different shows that happen that could be pulled from Charlotte and expanded into an entire series themselves. Several of which simply just do not work at all.\n\n__Show #1:__ Protagonist is antagonist, and is abusing his power to become king of the school.\n__Show #2:__ Slice of life with the school council going on about their business while occasionally dealing with other ability users.\n__Show #3:__ Comedy. Just... the comedy is almost found throughout the entire thing.\n__Show #4:__ Ro...romance. Because... there is a male protagonist and a female protagonist... and... _romance!_\n__Show #5:__ I mean since the entire thing is superhuman abilities, of course action would be throughout the entire show but, it gets fucking ridiculous towards the end.\n__Show #6:__ Tragedy. I'm sad, so I'm gonna go off and just beat the shit out of thugs and fuck around because I'm depressed because something very bad happened.\n__Show #7:__ ~!...Time... travel... because... because why not. Because why the fuck NOT.!~ \n__Show #8:__ Evil scientists are going to capture us and use for our abilities and dissect us!\n__Show #9:__ \"I'm going to travel the world and fix this problem!\"\n__Show #10:__ \"Feels\"/Self-sacrifice. \n\n...Now maybe you see the dilemma. This is not just one show review. This is ten show reviews. Because I'm going to go through every single one of these and everything that is wrong with them. However, there actually is one or two of these ten different shows, that I really really enjoyed and wish were larger parts of the show. Some of the other stuff in the other ones could have worked and been cool, but they were either done very quickly or very weirdly.\n\nLet's start, with the beginning.\n\n___\n\n#Charlotte Review #1: The Unlikable Protagonist#\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/9KO70FM.gif)\n\nThe first show of Charlotte is centered around our main male protagonist, Yuu Otosaka. He's our protagonist, but in the very first episode, he is doing things that a protagonist shouldn't be doing! He possesses the ability to take over other people, literally anybody he wants to take over and can see in his sight of vision, he can just take them over for five seconds.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/neDUosw.gif)\n\nHe has no idea why he has this ability, and to his knowledge, he's the only person in the world with an ability such as this. Since he can basically become anybody he wants and he has no reason to believe there'll be any consequences as a result of his selfish actions, he starts rampantly abusing this power. He cheats at tests, he makes himself the most popular student of his school, and he gets the most popular girl to fall in love with him after saving her after using his ability to put her in a life or death situation.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/CMWnNce.gif)\n\nSo like right away, the main character is a purposely unlikable sack of shit. And even when the other characters this show is centered around show up who also possess abilities appear to stop the shenanigans Yuu is getting into for his own good... he doesn't really ever satisfyingly redeem himself? He immediately goes from completely unlikable but interesting to completely and utterly generic in the transition from episode one to episode two.\n\nLike right after his shenanigans are put an end to, he goes home and it's revealed that he has a loving little sister. You know what I wouldn't have thought Yuu was given what we're shown of him and his personality up to this point? A good big brother. No, part of the purpose of why his sister even exists is because the show itself has already established Yuu as unlikable, but he's still the protagonist of the series.\n\nSo what's the quickest way to help ease that transition? Throw in the little sister character. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/Opo1iN0.gif)\n\nBut you know, this episode is basically entirely worthless. Because the next episodes aren't even really about Yuu redeeming himself... really, basically the only purpose episode 1 has is that the main female character repeatedly says to Yuu later on:\n\n\"Well, you've come a long way since being a scumbag who cheats on tests.\"\n\nBut then there's an episode later on where Yuu does a whole fuckload of shit way, way, WAY WORSE THAN ANYTHING HE DID IN EPISODE ONE.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/ANWY4Wi.jpg)\n\nOver the course of the entire show, he goes from unlikable, to still kind of unlikable but he's supposed to be trying to become better, to completely fucking insane, back to kind of unlikable, and then literally insane. And the most fucked up thing is that the only times I liked his character at all throughout all thirteen episodes was when he was absolutely fucked up and purposely unlikable. \n\nThe show's trying to get you to want to root for Yuu trying to redeem himself, but I was genuinely upset when the show itself finally had enough of Yuu's behavior, and had the main heroine step in to stop Yuu from SNORTING COCAINE. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/K6mE3cj.png)\n\nI was honestly way more interested where the show was gonna go if Yuu had crossed that line than the main heroine forcibly dragging the show back onto the rails where it belongs.\n___\n\n#Charlotte Review #2: The Filler Episodes#\n\nSo the student council of this school that shelters ability students show up and put a stop to Yuu's shit, and our main heroine, Nao Tomori, basically more or less forces Yuu to join the student council and help out with finding new ability users and reining them in, basically what the student council did with Yuu himself in episode 1.\n\nThis entire section of the show is almost completely worthless, and was probably the toughest section of Charlotte for me to slog through. To be fair there are various things established and there is actually at least sort of a purpose for these episodes that comes back later but...\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/1dfDi7y.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/HZDsi2U.png)~~~\n\nIt's just a whole lot of nothing. Like there's even an episode where basically to get an ability user to come out of hiding, they were forced to go camping at a specific spot for an extended period of time and... I immediately was transported back into the world of Glasslip. I'm watching all of these characters I really just do not like at all on a camping trip. _Why am I watching this? Why is this still going on?_\n\nThinking about it now actually, there was a part in one of these episodes where like a bunch of the other female students of the school show up and take Nao away, and then literally beat her up outside, and then that's never brought up or elaborated on ever again. \n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/PUWRxZn.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/tMpb5el.png)~~~\n\nSo you're just left thinking, well, what was the point of that? Nao is actually viciously assaulted or just punched directly in the face three times through the entire series, and almost every single time it happened, I sort of laughed. The first one especially because it came so out of nowhere. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/Mu52oxP.gif)\n\nLike why would you stop and wait until you could suckerpunch one out of the three people chasing you? There's still two other people chasing you.\n\nAnd then when you get to a certain episode about halfway through the show, the show just rubs the fact that there was almost no point to the preceding episodes, and that the rest of the show was going to go into a completely and drastically different direction now on the drop of a fucking dime.\n\nIt's fucking absurd that the sole thing that fucking actually heralds this moment of complete change for this series is that the sister's jar of pizza sauce is almost empty. Which... brings me... to the next Charlotte Review.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/hL9qX6Z.png)\n\n___\n\n#Charlotte Review #3: Unfunny Inappropriate Comedy#\n\nStop with the comedy. ___STOP IT.___\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/KqLH41U.gif)\n\nI could probably count the times where I actually thought it was funny on one hand. But even if all of the jokes and the comedy parts actually landed 100% of the time, this show would still be the tonal disaster it ends up being. You can't mix drama and comedy. It's oil and water. They do not go together. Especially if you're constantly switching from one to the other. Am I supposed to be seriously invested in this scene? Or am I supposed to be laughing because it's just gonna immediately swerve right back into comedy?\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/I9U1wc3.png)\n\nI think the ultimate moment with the comedy stuff that I think actually kind of worked but it is actually kind of blatant, was when Yuu has isolated himself at home because he's depressed and in mourning, but then here comes the student council members knocking on his door. \"Let us in! We're doing whacky comedy things! We wish to cheer you up because we're the happy comedy part of this show!\"\n\nAnd Yuu's just like...\n\n\"Dude. My sister JUST fucking died. Let me eat ramen in peace, you sacks of shit.\"\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/tNYWUmp.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/D6HeXe3.png)~~~\n\nThat's of course not a verbatim quote, because if he actually told them that, I would rate this show a lot higher than I am. But no seriously, this show is a fucking tonal disaster from the very first episode.\n\nActually, I guess the best and greatest joke of the entirety of Charlotte is of course the final appearance of the pizza sauce. But we're not there yet. We have to work up to the pizza sauce. Because while it's laughable and hilarious (in a bad way) in the early episodes, the ultimate purpose of the pizza sauce actually sent me into a wheezing and uncontrollable fit of laughter.\n\n...The more I think about it, Charlotte's the best comedy series of all of anime! It's just that all of the actually funny stuff comes from when the show's trying to be serious.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/0WqYC4z.png)\n\n___\n\n#Charlotte Review #4: Shoehorning Romance Into It#\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/gtke6yV.gif)\n\nAnother laughable aspect of Charlotte. Okay, so, you watch the opening of Charlotte and there is a part in the opening where like both Nao and Yuu are falling through the sky, and they're like moving towards each other midfall in an attempt to catch each other.\n\nAnd the moment you see that in the opening, you go oh. So they're gonna end up together. The show fucking does that thing where both Nao and Yuu say they supposedly dislike each other and they don't get along, but they really do get along, and the other characters mention wow you guys get along, are you dating???\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/iVnBRZB.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/8DvpoqP.png)~~~\n\nLook, I will fully admit I am not the biggest fan of the romance genre. There is probably like a handful of romance series that I can even remember, let alone say I actually enjoyed. But despite my cold dead heart, I am _actually not against romance in things._ It can be pretty good. It can also be pretty bad. It can also feel completely shoehorned in there and completely worthless, useless, and undeserved.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/3KxRAZf.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/J3EXsjc.png)~~~\n\nLike why do Nao and Yuu get together in the end? The correct answer is they are the main male and female characters, and the show needs them to be together in the end. Like I guess you could argue she fell in love with Yuu after he did the self-sacrifice thing, but that was entirely her idea she floated out to him with no intention of him actually going off and doing it, but then he does... and before he does, he RANDOMLY confesses that he loves her.\n\nThen she basically laughs at him and goes:\n\n\"Um. Do you remember the entirety of any of the last episodes? We don't get along together!\"\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/oDprEML.png)\n\nI mean Yuu does at one point sort of cures Nao's brother of his insanity, and at one point Nao helps Yuu drag himself out of a descending spiral into depression and insanity, but both of those events due to some circumstances which I will soon get into, ARE ESSENTIALLY RETCONNED FROM THE SHOW.\n\nYuu retains memories of Nao helping him out, but I don't think he actually bothers to help Nao's brother again after the retcon. As a matter of fact, that whole plotline happens directly as a result of a series of events that happens after Yuu's spiral into depression, and after the retcon, the show gives no reason to believe that Yuu made any of what happened before happen again.\n\nAll as a result of Jun Maeda being a hack or him just not feeling like covering that detail. Because it's not like Yuu's later self-sacrifice thing would help out Nao's brother in any way. It's what he does before the retcon that helps curse his insanity and--oh fuck everything.\n\n_EDITING TGG: Actually, in the credits of the very final episode, Nao's brother is shown smiling contently in his hospital bed with an autograph of the band's singer in his arms, so apparently he actually was cured of his insanity but... the series of events that leads up to when he's cured of his insanity is still retconned, so I don't know if this is just a plot hole or Jun Maeda was just considering that to still be canon even after he retcons it in a later episode. Additionally, I don't care enough to fucking tear my hair out to try and figure the finer details of this disaster out._\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/2w80x4z.png)\n\n_Also, I'm sorry, perhaps I haven't delved far enough into the romance sphere to be an authority on the subject, but it's probably safe to say that you __completely failed__ at creating an effective and well made romance when the \"confession scene\" is just then the characters discussing why it totally makes sense and is totally deserved for them to be in romance with each other._\n\n__Yuu:__ \"I love you because another version of you stopped me from doing cocaine in another timeline which I entirely abandoned.\"\n\n__Nao:__ \"Um, yeah. I'll reciprocate on your feelings if you travel the entire globe before you reach adulthood and take in all of these mind destroying superhuman abilities and SUCCESSFULLY return intact and alive.\"\n\n_Did Nao even ~~want~~ expect him to come back???_\n\n___\n\n#Charlotte Review #5: Protagonist Fails to Be the Action Hero#\n\nThere's a part towards the end of the show where like the other characters have no other choice but to rely on Yuu and basically they send him to deal with a bunch of random foreigners who have taken several of the ability users hostage. This is after when the truth about Yuu's ability is revealed. Whenever Yuu takes over an ability user, he in fact takes their ability from them and gains it for himself. Additionally, Yuu has gained the power of retconning at this point.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/pIAduTv.png)\n\nSo the other characters are like... well shit, man. Yuu's the most powerful ability user on the entire planet! _What could possibly go wrong!_\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/K75x14B.png)\n\n__Apparently everything.__ There is an episode before this where Yuu fucking snaps and becomes a wonderfully violent psychopath who is just brutally beating the shit out of people while also taking other people over, but despite the fact while Yuu still has clear memories of that, he is just completely fucking helpless when the show actually needs him to be an action hero the most.\n\nHe tries to take over the random foreigners, but neither of them have weapons. So then he uses telikinesis to like throw shit at them, but then a random ability user girl just jumps out from nowhere and slashes at one of Yuu's eyes. Apparently the retcon power requires both eyes to use. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/ot1VyMR.png)\n\nOh... how convenient, because if he just possessed the retcon powers, then he could just essentially erase all of these events and prevent everything from going horribly wrong. It'd be sort of hard to have any possible dramatic tension on the table after introducing a convenient retcon ability into the mix, _so just make that character unable to use it anymore._\n\n_Also, when he was rolling around on the floor screaming in pain after the small girl cut his eye, I was just thinking to myself that now he knows what all those random thugs he brutally fucked up before felt. Violence isn't quite as fun when you're on the receiving end, is it, you complete jackass???_\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/Oan3PrE.png)\n\nBut no like, Yuu is unable to shake this small girl off of his back and for some reason does not take her over, _THE ONLY ONE THERE WHO IS ARMED WITH A WEAPON AND IN FACT AN ABILITY USER_. So basically, Yuu got fucked up, is entirely powerless, and his retcon ability has been removed.\n\nWhat does he do then? He gets really worked up, and that triggers one of the ability's he's obtained at this point, and that ability is basically causing the entire area around him to explode and fall apart, potentially killing everyone including himself. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/lnBbb3w.png)\n\nAlso, the foreigners somehow knew that he wouldn't be able to use the time travel ability if he lost an eye and was aware of the \"IMMEDIATE DEATH\" ability Yuu possesses and will trigger if he's worked up enough... and their plan was just to have small girl stab and cut at him, which is what causes him to freak the fuck out and trigger the collapse ability.\n\nNot to mention he actually almost straight up triggered the ability before this when his brother was just simply telling him the plan back at their facility. He could have killed his sister (again), his brother, and all of his friends right there and then. Good job, Yuu. You really are a worthwhile and __GREAT AND USEFUL PROTAGONIST.__ He's just completely worthless whenever he _ISN'T_ insane.\n\nBut then the show cuts to the other characters who sent Yuu into this situation in the first place, and they had told Yuu that they would be right behind him and backing him up just in case things went wrong. However, there is a HUGE distance between where they're at and where the ongoing scene's happening and they're like...\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/tNQkjRQ.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/1IJHvc5.png)~~~\n\n\"Oh shit, Yuu's making everything explode! _WHY ISN'T HE USING THE CONVENIENT RETCON ABILITY THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY MAKE HIM GO COMPLETELY BLIND IF HE KEPT RELYING ON IT?_\"\n\nAnd then in another fucking unintended hilarious moment, they fucking comically run to the scene.  But they're so far away, as if they didn't anticipate this at all. Why wouldn't they assume the foreigners would at least have an idea of how to disable the retcon ability if they made it clear to them that they were in fact even aware of it in the first place? And I'm not even going into the foreigners' safeguard against the retcon ability and everything that's wrong with it because my head would explode.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/Poku9Bw.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/wLlIjpU.png)~~~\n\n_This random guy that the viewers didn't even previously know? We will kill his family if you travel into the past. But when you travel into the past you're essentially abandoning this entire timeline so who even cares about this version of this guy's family???_\n\nNo, fuck that. We're moving onto my favorite show out of all of Charlotte.\n\n___\n\n#Charlotte Review #6: Protagonist Snaps and Becomes a Violent Lunatic#\n\nOkay so like halfway through the show, the sister says she's feeling sick and the pizza sauce jar is almost empty, so a completely random and out of nowhere series of events happen and it turns out the Yuu's important sister _who is an actual character you should care about_, possesses an ability of her own. The ability is to make the entire area around her explode and fall apart (WOW WHAT A USEFUL AND CONVENIENT ABILITY), and it causes her death when a completely random yandere shows up with a box cutter and wants to cut her and see some _pizza sauce._\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/AaFZFvd.png)\n\nThe sister dies and Yuu proceeds to completely rescind into his own asshole. You thought he was unlikable in episode 1? His reaction to his sister dying is basically just saying fuck the entire world, I'm just gonna eat a bunch of ramen our uncle (_that never appears or is ever mentioned again_) sent us in the very first episode and watch TV. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/GRiwCLJ.png)\n\nBut when apparently the secret society of scientists who hunt and capture ability users come knocking _(now that I think about it, it was most likely just people from the school since that's just what Yuu himself says)_, Yuu's like fuck it and decides to leave, but before he does, he takes over one of the guys there to capture him and force him to leap off the ledge of the building.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/XdqCBDq.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/meZJnaj.png)~~~\n\nWe hear the impact of the fall, we hear his pained screams, if he survived that fall, his legs are most likely broken, and the entire rest of his life has permanently been changed. And there were two other people there. With what we've been shown of Yuu's ability, he could have just taken one of them over and had the other one knock the other two out and then have the one he was controlling knock himself out. Actually, he leaves the third one perfectly fine. \n\nThere was absolutely no reason for Yuu to force him to jump off and have his legs get broken unless Yuu had completely stopped giving a fuck. And sure enough, I was completely unaware that they were just getting started.\n\nYuu just wanders around aimlessly eating pizza and other snacks and he like starts to frequent an arcade with a zombie shooting game and he's just screaming DIE! DIE! as he's playing this game and he just sounds and looks like a fucking complete psychopath, and then when thugs are playing the zombie shooting game and won't let him play, he just fucking provokes the thugs and then fucks them up.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/b2VO1J0.gif)\n\n_The protagonist Charlotte needs, but doesn't deserve: Insane Yuu._\n\nThen from there on out, it's just a fucking descent into horrific violence and Yuu stabs a guy twice in the same leg, and at one point, he's about to stab a thing through a guy's eye permanently blinding him. And I was just... I didn't know how we got here from Yusarin's magical spells, but for once in the entire show, I was fully on board for Jun Maeda's wild ride.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/GlPt9lb.gif)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/SB7RU7C.gif)~~~\n\n_On the top: Charlotte. On the bottom: Also Charlotte._\n\nNo other series has actually had me rooting for the protagonist to start snorting cocaine. But then Nao just appears and kicks it out of Yuu's hand \n\n~~oh by the way, Nao's ability is she can turn invisible~~\n\nand reveals that she had been there the entire time. Wait, the ENTIRE time? \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/OwLp04F.png)\n\nSo all of that horrific violence and bloodlust Yuu was reveling in, Nao had no problem with that, but oh no... if Yuu snorts a bit of cocaine, he's gonna stop being a human entirely.\n\n...HE STABBED SOMEONE IN THE LEG TWICE AND WAS LAUGHING ABOUT IT. Is this Jun Maeda's personal reptilian morals? Horrific violence is okay, but drugs? They're no good!\n\n_Jun Maeda was probably on cocaine when he wrote this fucking series' script jesus christ_\n\n...Wait, _oh my GOD._ I was gonna actually move onto the next section without actually addressing the pizza sauce! Okay so, the way that Nao sparks a renewed will to live in Yuu is... \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/jvdlVYZ.gif)\n\nThe pizza sauce. \n\nThe fucking meme pizza sauce that is brought up time and time again throughout the earlier episodes, actually has a serious plot purpose. YUU IS AT HIS LOWEST POINT, BUT HE IS THEN BROUGHT BACK BY THE PIZZA SAUCE AND...\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/H9TTH0l.png)\n\nThis is why I'm just so set on the Jun Maeda being a reptile theory. Yuu just eats a pizza sauce omelet, cries a little bit, and he's back to normal. Dead sister _aside_, stabbing and breaking people's legs _aside_, Yuu is back to normal and we're just gonna pretend that 90% of this episode never even happened and then it'll just be retconned _because go fuck yourself_.\n\nYou know, as much as it set me off when I originally watched it, I wouldn't even be against the pizza sauce omelet being the trigger  for Yuu's redemption... if it was just set up better. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/2zUoNWQ.png)\n\nLike the pizza sauce is just this weird dumb and recurring joke. _Why did you put pizza sauce in this when it obviously doesn't belong? Why can't you just cook normal food?_ Why couldn't it have just been a more normal ingredient that only the sister put in stuff, rather than this comical pizza sauce that I just... I just absolutely cannot take seriously. \n\nTo conclude on episode seven, this actually contains almost the sole instance throughout the entire show where I could actually sympathize with Yuu. It very much feels like his sister JUST died and these characters are coming in when he's just trying to mourn and hassling him. Not so much the other student council people, but his \"girlfriend\" from episode one that randomly comes back for some reason (?) and then proceeds to call him mentally ill??? Which I guess is probably kind of true but like why you would straight up tell a person in mourning that they're mentally ill to their face and...\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/hdk5YyK.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/bpNq6SZ.png)~~~\n\nBut then of course Yuu's \"mourning\" just transitions into horrific violence and while I was still on board, I was on board for probably the wrong reasons at that point.\n\n___\n\n#Charlotte Review #7: TIME TRAVEL#\n\nSo if you looked at the spoiler tag for this one at the start of the review, you already knew ~~or I guess could have just assumed~~, but the \"retcon ability\" Yuu obtains is essentially TIME TRAVEL.\n\n...The time travel stuff just comes so completely out of nowhere that it's why I recommended just going off and watching Charlotte for yourself. __There was no fucking reason for this show to have time travel, and yes, I know it's sort of kind of set up from the very beginning.__ Jun Maeda is a fucking hack. The only thing the time travel contributes to anything is that Yuu saves the sister and essentially retcons THE MOST INTERESTING AND ENTERTAINING PART OF THE ENTIRE SHOW (see previous section).\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/NRBQkqP.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/Qh4fBF4.png)~~~\n\nBut like the twist is actually genuinely effective and certainly I didn't fucking expect that this show would head in this direction. And like that entire flashback portion of that episode with Yuu and his sister and forgotten older brother being captives... like if that had actually been the show...\n\n...\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/ZCrDjS8.png)\n\n_...Why wasn't that the actual show?_ No, why wasn't that the actual fucking show? The science facility and the ability users secretly plotting and trying to form a resistance... \n\nBut it's basically just fodder to lead into... this series also has time travel and the Yuu in this flashback is actually a different Yuu but actual Yuu for some reason gains the memory of this other timeline's Yuu after going to a concert and hearing a band's brand new song which he had previously heard in the other timeline.\n\n...There was no fucking reason this series also had to have time travel beyond Jun Maeda being a hack and also _why not_. This is basically solidified when again, the small girl slashes at Yuu's eye therefore disabling the time travel ability he took from his older brother. Then later on, he gets the ability to heal and he briefly considers healing his now blind eye and going back in the past to save Winnie the Pooh from dying which is entirely his fault and he can probably do now since I guess apparently he takes the abilities he's stolen with him to the past somehow, but then he decides not to.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/SOjKl51.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/cRaqr1v.png)~~~\n\n# \"Winnie the Pooh has to remain dead! I must not misuse these powers ever again!\" #\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/o6jrsMF.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/R08Glrx.png)~~~\n\n...You know, Yuu saving his sister... that's basically the same exact situation, except _he's personally responsible_ for Pooh's death because Yuu is a horrible failure. So he's basically saying he shouldn't have saved his sister either, and that his brother shouldn't have did any time traveling to save the ability users. \n\nOr Yuu is just saying this because at this point, it's the final episode, and Jun Maeda is completely out of time. _Pooh has to be forgotten. We can't go back for Pooh!_\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/Icq8orc.png)\n\n...Did I even mention one of the character's nicknames is POOH? _AS IN WINNIE THE POOH?_ ___AS IN WINNIE THE FUCKING POOH?___ See, his last name is Kumagami, and \"Kuma\" means bear, and Winnie the Pooh is a bear. So Yuu's big brother calls him Pooh.\n\n...I was so waiting for him to scream out \"POOH!\" when they came to him after he was brutally impaled as a result of _how much of a failure Yuu is_. I would have probably literally died with laughter. But of course, he didn't. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/WtJN3yM.png)\n\nAlso, it's supposed to be just another one of the comedy bits, but I couldn't even remember Pooh's actual real name without looking it up.\n\n...I can't provide a better example of Charlotte being a tonal nightmare beyond the character who is nicknamed after Winnie the Pooh getting goddamned impaled. And out of the two deaths throughout the entire show, it's the only one that matters because it's purposely not undone via time travel. Also this is by far probably the ~~visually~~ goriest moment out of all of Charlotte and there was absolutely no reason for it beyond attempting to emotionally suckerpunch you with this character you probably don't even care too much about's death. I mean, they didn't even bother to show the little sister's death back when she died! Why Pooh? Why did we have to see Pooh impaled?\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/y72zx9I.png)\n\nTo be honest, I actually liked Pooh a lot more when he was just some weird guy we couldn't see's face that for some reason is dripping every single time he comes into the student council. But then the show explains why he was dripping all of those times and it was just... him throwing a glass of water into his face to hide his identity from people who... have never met him? What? Why. So his ability is completely irrelevant to the dripping...\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/IDOswQL.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/28Tm0pH.png)~~~\n\nCouldn't he have just told them where the ability users were vocally while not having to soak himself every single time he shows up? There had to have been another and easier way to hide his face--oh just... it doesn't matter.  \n\n___\n\n#Charlotte Review #8: Who IS Charlotte?#\n\nIt's fucking bizzare to me that Jun Maeda actually included an explanation for the origin of the superhuman abilities. I was fully prepared to get Glasslip'd again but thinking about it, I'm not sure if actually including an explanation is actually better or not.\n\nBecause first of all, it basically comes out of nowhere almost at the very end of the show, but to Jun Maeda's credit, he sort of actually sets it up early on? \n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/5tonl5V.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/FTznMvz.png)~~~\n\nBut then like episode 11 is just outright named Charlotte and there's not a character named Charlotte throughout the entirety of Charlotte. Then a scientist man just straight up starts exposition'ing to Yuu and his REVIVED VIA TIME TRAVEL little sister about the comet named Charlotte.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/9T9rt87.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/CvEfjn6.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/SVyIR6Q.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/6lQX9IJ.png)~~~\n\nBasically Charlotte is a comet that passes over Earth at the earliest every seventy five years or so and it leaves particles, and people who are exposed to the particles, eventually develop superhuman abilities. Completely random abilities that can literally be anything you can think of. Telikinesis, time travel, freezing powers, fire power, healing, invisibility, being able to take other people's powers and possess people, and being able to sense other people who also have abilities, and so much more.\n\nThe show even goes as far to basically state Charlotte the comet was in fact the cause of witch trials in Europe, and the pro-ability user scientists have developed a vaccine to prevent the development of superhuman abilities for those who don't already possess them and...\n\nEverything about this is just so fucking wrong, and the show is basically trying to barrel through all of this information as quickly as possible before the viewer tries to connect the various dots they've presented to us only to fail horribly. Because like right after this random exposition dump about Charlotte, it just goes right into them playing mahjong but my head was still back in the comet stuff.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/Yc6qEIY.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/r988jpI.png)~~~\n\nLike... they've developed a vaccine for... particles of a comet, that passes over Earth... only once every seventy five years. How exactly did they develop this vaccine? ~~I mean they do actually have a fragment from probably the comet itself in their possession but.~~ How exactly do they intend on vaccinating the people of the world with this anti-comet vaccine? How are they even sure it'll fucking work? How are they going to proceed with these global vaccinations when I thought there's a group of scientists hunting for the ability users and wouldn't they directly be opposed to the idea of preventing future ability users from being created? \n\nIf it was just the comet, you could just let it pass. I'm not going to be an asshole and go \"well how the fuck does the particles of a comet give people abilities anywhere from telikinesis to goddamned time travel?\" because really, it doesn't matter how. _Magic! Whatever!_ \n\nBut the moment the idea of a vaccine is introduced, it becomes different. Because you assume the vaccine is going to be an important plot device that matters. Ultimately how they get the powers in the first place... it would have been passable if it was just magical comet particles.\n\nHowever, then Yuu himself asks his older brother a question along the lines of \"can't they create a vaccine to remove already developed existing abilities?\" and his older brother just fires back that it takes time to create a new vaccine and they can't because they just finished this one. But how are you even sure this one works? There's no way of testing or finding out because assumingly, Charlotte has already passed and it supposedly takes centuries to make it back again.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/A19hIK9.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/PFvRL4S.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/CoK9izB.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/l3jAFQL.png)~~~\n\nIf they had instead started with a vaccine to remove already existing abilities, they could at least test it and have a very easy way to know if it works or not. \"Can you still breathe fire? No? Then we've completed the vaccine.\" \n\n...Usually, I'm on the side of \"well, you SHOULD explain this thing\" but Jun Maeda should have just left it at \"magical comet\" and moved on. Because right after all this exposition about Charlotte and the vaccine, the show moves right into the action section of the show, and thus we don't get any further answers.\n\nBut that leaves us with the question of... well, the vaccine should stop any future magical comet particles, but what happens with the current ability users that have already gotten their abilities?\n\n___\n\n#Charlotte Review #9: Traveling the Entire Globe in a Single Episode#\n\nLet's talk about the final episode now, which... again... could have been an entire _and much better series_ on its own. Actually, this is without a doubt the most blatant one. Yuu travels the entire fucking globe in a single episode and we're shown his adventures throughout numerous countries until the show says \"oh shit we're running out of time, WE JUST HAVE TO START CHECKING OFF COUNTRIES NOW.\"\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/Mz9MS33.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/RHbDTVC.png)~~~\n\nJun Maeda has essentially written himself into a fucking corner because he's a complete hack fraud. The action section where Yuu attempts to save his friends is over, but it's left basically everyone either completely fucked up or depressed because _Winnie the Pooh is fucking dead_, and like nothing is resolved at all.\n\nSo here comes main girl Nao and she just casually floats the idea of Yuu travelling the entire world and stealing every single ability of every single ability user that is living on the entire planet Earth. She basically says it's probably a terrible idea because if Yuu consumes all of the abilities, he'll probably basically entirely lose it and go completely fucking insane.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/fW45z3Z.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/omSjPdt.png)~~~\n\n_\"Protagonist, you have to do this thing that may end up leading you to genociding the entire world.\"_\n\nBut then Yuu basically fucking says you know what, I'll fucking do it why not also ~~I LOVE YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE A FEMALE AND I AM A MALE~~ Yuu in fact takes the time to confess to Nao because he has developed a deep and true love for her, and Nao's all like ~~REMEMBER THAT TIME WHEN I JUST WATCHED AS YOU BEAT PEOPLE'S FACES IN AND STABBED THEM IN THE LEG IN THE OTHER TIMELINE~~ I'll accept your confession of love if you manage to make it back after having absorbed all of the abilities of everyone on the entire planet before you lose your ability when your adolescence ends (that's when the abilities naturally go away).\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/VuqMFpR.gif)\n\n...You know, this episode is actually the perfect note for Charlotte to go out on. By this point, actually, FAR BEFORE this point, I was just fucking shell shocked and in disbelief that this show could go any further than it already had. But no yeah. They also had to do the self-sacrifice thing.\n\nOnly one episode left but Yuu is gonna go on this journey around the world and consume every single ability and... like assuming... there is like seven billion total people living on planet Earth. How many ability users were created by the last time the Charlotte comet passed by? A couple of million? A couple of hundred thousand? Nao herself in the final episode says it was at least \"tens of thousands\" of them. He apparently has to at least go to literally every single fucking country and I don't care if he picked up on every single ability that would make this journey more and more convenient... it would take a massive amount of time to pull off this endeavor.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/SSUo3RC.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/MayElmO.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/acBq8Wg.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/tnxiCNx.png)~~~\n\nOh, I picked up an ability that allows me to not have to sleep anymore. Oh, I picked up an ability that allows me to speak in literally any fucking language I want. Oh, I picked up an ability where I can tell where ability users are just by looking at a paper map. Oh, I picked up an ability to see where people who have been exposed to the Charlotte comet and will in the future develop abilities, and also an ability to force them to develop their abilities immediately, so I can consume them and not have to return to this country in however many years.\n\nBasically, once more, Yuu is fucking sliding into his \"unlikable\" or \"insane\" personality, and like if he goes to sleep, he just wanders off in his sleep and starts fucking shit up. But the show doesn't have time to develop or expend any time on any of this. The show is just rushing itself as fast as it possibly can to get Yuu back to Nao so the show can just fucking end, to the point where LIKE THE MOMENT AFTER YUU OBTAINS THE VERY FINAL ABILITY, HIS BROTHER IMMEDIATELY SHOWS UP IN A HELICOPTER AS SOMEONE ELSE IS ABOUT TO KILL HIM BUT...\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/PB6K3Gi.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/B405D6u.png)~~~\n\nHIS BROTHER HAD ABSOLUTELY NO WAY OF KNOWING WHERE YUU WAS, AND HE JUST IMMEDIATELY AND CONVENIENTLY SHOWS UP _VIA HELICOPTER_ AND SAVES YUU.\n\n...Couldn't he have just died? I mean yes, it'd be a downer ending, but it would have been neater than... well...\n\n___\n#Charlotte Review #10: Please Care About the Protagonist#\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/udhOqAr.png)\n\nThe note the show ends on is... Yuu makes it back to Nao and he has essentially removed all abilities from everyone who had them and everyone who would have developed them, and the vaccine is a thing just in case that pesky old Charlotte comes passing by Earth again with its pesky particles.\n\nThere's supposed to be like impact in Yuu and Nao's reunion and especially when Nao realizes that Yuu has lost all memory of her as a result of his ridiculous globe trotting journey. But as I've expressed previously, the romance between Yuu and Nao is just so fucking laughable and undeveloped. The show really wants you to care, but you honestly shouldn't. It is completely undeserved.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/Vd0ktOu.png)\n\n\"Your flash cards that you created for me were the only thing I couldn't part with because even as I was being driven insane by this plan that you yourself told me about, I still remembered that these cards were something you gave to me, and I love the flash cards because I love you and you created the flash cards.\"\n\nLike every single time this series tries to fucking manipulate your emotions one way, it just completely fucking fails or is just laughable. Like even when Nao starts crying and welcomes Yuu back I was just like... \"why is she crying?\"\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/piicVcH.png)\n\nShe basically verbatim asked if Yuu was joking when he first confessed his love to her, but no, I'm supposed to be \"feeling emotions\" because they are together and they are the romance together because they are the main male and female characters of the show. But there was no fucking development or depth to their relationship. You can do the whole \"everybody else tells us that we get along, but we don't think we get along\" but there has to be development.\n\nYou can't fucking slap some sentimental flash cards down on the table with a side of self-sacrifice and say \"okay now they love each other.\"\n\n...Now that I think about it, I'm actually not sure what emotion the ending is actually trying to manipulate you into feeling. Happiness that the plot has finally been resolved and Yuu is back with Nao or like the bittersweet thing because Yuu is now basically kind of a shell of himself because he doesn't fucking remember anything.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/1lwPpCg.png)\n\n___\n\n#C-4: Conclusions#\n\n...There's probably tons and tons of more details that I was gonna bring up but forgot or missed ~~or maybe I edited those in~~, but my overall conclusion and opinion on Charlotte is that it's completely fucking batshit insane. It's absolutely fucking horrible, the show did not need time travel and bringing it in only made it even more of a mess, it's a tonal nightmare, the characters are either unlikable, boring, or joke characters, it's like ten shows in one, and all the serious moments are fucking hilarious and all of the comical moments are almost entirely dumb and unfunny.\n\nI give Charlotte a __5 out of a 100__ and while if you've read this far into the review, I've basically spoiled the entire show for you if you didn't heed my warning at the start and just went and watched it yourself, I still would absolutely recommend watching Charlotte. At several moments, Charlotte actually had me thinking that this was _TOO_ perfect. That Jun Maeda knew what he was doing, and was making something completely fucking horrible and wrong on purpose.\n\nNow, that I've finished it, I'm still honestly not really too sure. It feels genuine, but just... dropping time travel like in almost the very last part of a show? Nobody can be this _brilliant!_\n\nIt's a fucking horrible masterpiece. I give it a _100 out of 100_ on the pizza sauce grading scale.\n\n~~~img(https://i.imgur.com/Uc3AAot.jpg)~~~\n\n___\n\n_So... you weren't even actually attempting to escape the compound? You were just trying to make sense of Experiment C-4?_\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n_And... what you came up with was just... bashing your own head into varying objects over and over again?_\n\n\"...Yes. Look, I know it sounds stupid, but if you just watch it yourself, you'll know what I was going through! Nothing made sense! Like PA Works makes fine looking shows, but what drugs were Jun Maeda on???\"\n\n_Oh no, you're not going to fool me. I saw firsthand what happened with the last researcher who  risked firsthand exposure to the works themselves. Look, next time, just ask, and we'll provide you with a proper head bashing area.

Thank goodness after the thousandth intern you bashed your skull into, you finally passed out and we could capture you._\n\n\"...I apparently almost successfully escaped this secret compound run by a group of secret super scientists that kidnap people all over the globe for use in their experiments without even purposefully trying to escape?\"\n\n_...It's rather hurtful when you word it that way._\n\n~~~img(https://i.imgur.com/T7UqhzP.png)~~~\n\n___\n\n...In the past and in a dimly lit room at P.A.

Many people mindlessly praise this anime and some go even as far as calling it the anime of the season. I think it's greatly overrated and I can't help it but to point out some of its many flaws and shortcomings.\n~~~__SPOILERS INCLUDED.__~~~\n\n~~~_(Disclaimer: I did not read the manga.)_~~~\n\n~~~_inhales..._ BOI.~~~\n\n\n##~~~Characters~~~\nLet's start off with my biggest issue with this anime, the characters. The way the show introduces characters doesn't feel fleshed out and they have minimal backstories which feel horribly rushed. \n\nThey kept dropping in so many interesting characters in the most spontaneous way who were many times more interesting than the actual main storydriven characters and I think they did not give them enough backstory/introduction. It was as if they were just checking off tick-boxes for the quota of characters that they would need to ex-machina-the-story further.\nThey needed someone to help craft Chise a magical staff/wand. So they introduced Lindel, the ancient dragon-keeper mage. Lindel has also known Elias for ages. Sounds pretty interesting, right?\nWell, Lindel helped her make the staff in one episode and was shown in Elias' one-episode-backstory and was never relevant in another episode again, excluding the maybe 60 seconds where they showed the kidnapping of the dragonling. That's it.\nEven worse with Rahab, the mage/mentor/teacher to Elias and Lindel. She seems like a super interesting character who could really shed some light on the whole mystery behind Elias, right? Well, she got maybe 5 minutes of screentime at most.\n\nWhy bother introducing characters that feel interesting and relevant to the story when you just sweep them under the rug in the next episode. It's really disappointing and this trend kept repeating.\n\nNow let's look at Elias, one of the two main characters. He was obviously the most interesting character and we did not find out shit about him in the end. I can't help but hate the fact that they left Elias without a proper backstory.\nAs for Chise, I really liked how they introduced her and I kind of liked her backstory in the first episodes, but in the end it boiled down to her being a whiny suicidal brat. They then tried to make her super compassionate and whatnot, but that just didn't sell. She felt really shallow no matter what the show tried to make of her and I could not find a single aspect which I would like about the character.\n\n##~~~Art~~~\n\nThe art is very inconsistent. At some points they use beautifully drawn top-tier backgrounds (e.g. some forest scenes etc.) and in contrast to that they sometimes butcher it with the most generic nondescript smudged rock-n-grass/wall-n-one-piece-of-furniture backgrounds you can think of. Vibrant and detailed vs. empty and nondescript. I really hated how it alternated between said designs. You could easily notice this with static scenes and moving scenes, where a static scene would look incomparably better.\nI know it was most likely because of budget constraints, but that is not an excuse in my eyes. You should try to make your art look consistent throughout the whole show.\nSidenote: The chibi parts which were supposed to act as comic relief felt out of place and didn't belong into the anime which is trying this hard to be a drama.\n\n##~~~Soundtrack/Effects~~~\n\nI will try to make this section very brief. I will also disregard the opening and ending songs.\nThe music and effects were the redeeming qualities of this anime. I loved how they fleshed out the birds and whatnot in the forest scenes, the background music was really decent and it all managed to fit together really well, especially with the whole celtic/anglosaxon/gaelic music themes during fairy scenes for example.\n\n##~~~Verdict~~~\n\nAs previously stated, the anime is very engaging at first and then goes into very mediocre levels. The main characters are half-decent.\nElias' story is feels heavily neglected and I doubt I'm the only one who would love to know what turned him into a skullheaded thornmonster.\nChise's character barely experiences any growth or personality change throughout the whole anime and she seems like a whiny spineless burden to the whole story and finally grows as a character in the last couple episodes, essentially making you sit through maybe 18 out of 24 episodes of watching a unstable teenage girl wading through pools of her own tears, just like Shinji Akari who atleast had the balls to rub one out to a comatose girl.\n\nTLDR:\nThis anime lacked consistency, had too many time and budget constraints, felt rushed, the story was all over the place, the drama was forced at times, it could not make the main grill likeable and left too many questions unanswered and story points unfinished.\n\n##~~~Should you watch it?~~~\nOnly if you have nothing better to do."}, {"id": 2439, "score": 40, "body": "Ok, I really needed to get this out of my head since this is probably one of the worst animes I've ever seen that had an actual cool concept.

Now bear with me, I know anime isn't supposed to be realistic but you need to have fundamentals, you can't just throw words at it and hope people won't realize that you're just saying random gibberish. That's what happens here, random gibberish and actions, for example [Spoilers ahead] when doing the dude's arc they have football, and in football there are rules...well not in here, in here the guy just charges at the goal and tackles everyone else in front of him...keep in mind THIS IS NOT AMERICAN FOOTBALL, this is soccer, you can't just charge and tackle people out of the way.\nThis was just an example of the \"plot twists\" and \"solutions\" that are found in this anime. On the last arc specially they start throwing around scientific words and procedures without having any, and I mean, any idea what do they mean to a point that it is painful to watch.\n\nArt and animation: I'm pretty sure this anime was animated by an army on interns that couldn't finish an Art Degree in college, I did better animations in 11th grade.\n\nOverall: The anime starts out great but rapidly becomes dull, predictable and incredibly unrealistic, the characters aren't really memorable and the aniamtion is shite.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this."}, {"id": 2495, "score": 22, "body": "__- I N T R O -__\nI was looking for the next quick watch to help me relax from all of the great but tense anime I've been watching and I decided on Rakudai Kishi No Cavalry after seeing a few fun clips on YouTube.

It seems like a surefire win for Stella, but could there be more to Ikki than meets the eye?\n\nOf course there is something more to him, he's the protagonist of a Light Novel adaptation.\nThe premise is insultingly generic and the story itself is no different. All of the LN clich\u00c3\u00a9s you could think of, it's like Rakudai hits them all on purpose.\nThe pacing is too fast at moments and at some episodes it's non-existent.\nThe writing feels extremely amateurish at more than a few points and the comedy is extremely forced.\n\nThe battle scenes are handled alright, though they're nothing great. Two of the battles are well choreographed and do flow nicely, but that's far too few. Every other battle relies on absolute non-sense or Ikki's ability which is to use 100% of his power in one go, since humans can never bring out 100% of their power.\nThough this ability does not last long and serves as a victimization tool for the protagonist. The moment it's duration expires, Ikki collapses because he's tired to create the illusion he really struggled with the battle when he easily defeated his opponent with his plot convenient power.\n\n__- C H A R A C T E R S -__\nNone of the characters are unique, Kurogane is nothing more than your typical bland self-insert present in plenty of Light Novels. He has no personality outside of constantly spewing his clich\u00c3\u00a9d ideologies like ''Friends should never be hurt'',  ''the truly strong ones are the people who have someone to protect'', etc.\nOther than him being a rather weak character, there's nothing much to say about him. His backstory is mildly interesting but it is nothing new.\nThe main female lead, Stella, is a basic tsundere. They didn't go out of their way to flesh her out or make her a unique. She's just a waifu archetype and nothing more.\nIn fact, every single female in this series is a waifu archetype, none of them are developed. They feel rather uninspired in terms of design.\n\nWhatever antagonists this anime has, he/she's nothing more than a one dimensional villain to make sure the MC looks cool infront of the girl. They don't really have much of a personality on their own.\n\nThe show also tried to shamelessly force in incest, yes, it doesn't miss out a single clich\u00c3\u00a9d Light Novel trope.\nHis sister is in love with him, she's nothing more than a shallow character serving only as a love rival to the main female lead. \nAlongside her, we're introduced to another character, he happens to be male so of course in order to not get in the way of the harem he has ''a maiden's heart''. \n\nThe main selling point of Rakudai Kishi No Cavalry is the fact that unlike many anime of that sort, the main characters do get in a relationship, that doesn't stop  Kurogane from having his low-key ship moments with the other girls to tease the fans of course. Also, every single romantic interaction of theirs is extremely forced, the author felt the need to constantly remind the viewers/readers that the two MCs are in a relationship and that it's a big deal.\n\n__- A R T  &   A N I M A T I O N -__\nThe art in Rakudai feels extremely bland and uninspired, you would have a hard time setting it apart from similar anime such as Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan or  many other. There is no set atmosphere in it, it's just a regular city with a messy setting. It seems more technologically advanced in certain places but other locations feel just like a regular city building. Despite all of this, it does fit with the series and still does feel pretty at places.\n\nArt aside, the animation is actually good during the action scenes, it flows nicely but as I mentioned before, the battles themselves are not well choreographed, they feel like a slugfest of random attacks, only the very first battle had some kind of strategy involved but even then the animation  still makes the action scenes enjoyable.\n\n__- O V E R A L L -__\nRakudai Kishi no Cavalry is a terrible anime with pretty but uninspired visuals, bland cast and terrible writing that plays out like an amateurish fan-fiction written by an edgy 12 year old.\n"}, {"id": 2496, "score": 20, "body": "However laughable, cliche-ridden, and squickworthy the story is, there's promise hidden in there. A young girl, after seeing that her parents have been brutally murdered, gets taken under the wing of a corrupt detective in exchange for being a sex slave and is made to become an assassin to kill other corrupt people. It's apparent that Quentin Tarantino borrowed the basic premise of a young orphan growing up to kill those who are bad and those who have wronged her for his Kill Bill series. The blood splatter, the fast pace of the action scenes interspersed with the calm, dialogue-heavy (though not as effective or even good in this movie's case) scenes filled, one-liners full of cheese and the like, even jazzy throwback music accompaniment... Tarantino surely must have watched this film, even enjoyed it.\n\nHowever, everything is done either A) by-the-books, B) in spite of the viewer and/or C) lazily, making this an incredibly annoying watch. As for as point A goes, the story is full of cliches of the \"assassin/revenge\" plotline, and it's easily predictable. If you've seen a film or read a story centered around revenge or assassins (like Kill Bill!), then within 10 to 15 minutes you can easily guess where the anime will be headed.\n\nPoint B is what really knocks it down quite a bit. Any substance is replaced with sleaze. As mentioned earlier, the main girl is taken in but in addition to becoming an assassin she's a sex slave to the corrupt detective, and that's not all. Lots of ridiculous blood-splattering, explosions, vomit, hentai, sex jokes, hypocrisy of moral values (and not in a head-turning or unique way; just straight-up stupid character development)... Hell, the jazz soundtrack just makes the \"shock\" worse. It tries to play it off as cool and edgy, but it just makes the anime feel draggy and idiotic. When people talk about anime being sleazy and filled with sex (as people who know little to none about it are prone to do), they think of anime like Kite.\n\nThe biggest point of contention here for me though, is the laziness part. It's 1998; much better animation existed in many different series like Cowboy Bebop, Pokemon, Outlaw Star, Serial Experiments Lain, Trigun. Perfect Blue and Princess Mononoke came out the year before, and as silly as it is to compare an anime from a totally different genre, Neon Genesis Evangelion had very great animation despite being on a small budget. Yet all the faces look dead-eyed, blank, even creepy. Facial expressions are minimal beyond generic happiness, sad, or angry. Audio for the speaking starts nearly a full half-second after lips start moving (I'm hoping this is just Netflix's fault and not the OVA's), yet all other audio is fine. There are frames where everything freezes, not because of a point being proven or something emphasized, but just to fill running time. Even the voices sound strained and half-assed.\n\nI could look past the fact that this is essentially a glorified hentai OVA if it were voiced and animated well. I can get past the (quite frankly disturbing) sex scenes and the shameless gore and lack of a strong story if it looked like the people who worked on it cared. But it's obvious that they didn't care, so I can't learn to care after it ends (beyond writing a review for this). The worst kind of thing to feel for a movie is a lack of caring when it so desperately and clearly wants you to care and feel something beyond annoyance and anger. If no one working on this cares, then neither do I. "}, {"id": 2498, "score": 40, "body": "Lasting the length of a single standard episode, Nyanko Days is cute and fluffy, and gets by entirely on being cute and fluffy. In fact, there's so little substance that it's a struggle to even talk about the show beyond its substance.\n\nIt's not really that it's bad per se. It's mindless and cute stuff to turn your brain off to for about a half-hour, so it's perfectly serviceable in that regards and serves its function in that way. It's also incredibly cute which no one can deny. It's hard to criticize because it effectively serves its function and arguing against that function just feels like it comes off as weird and nitpicky. But one can afford to be nitpicky over a series that is, effectively, nothing.\n\nWhen you really get down to it, Nyanko Days is the most anime thing an anime is. Anthropomorphized cats, big eyes and cute faces with characters fitting nicely into archetypes, constant sugary cuteness, loner girl starts to hang out with non-loner girl... it manages to be incredibly exhausting in the very short time it runs, because it feels so much like other similar anime. I don't need originality, but I need something that's derivative with something to offer, and there's nothing here. Not even the cats are cats I can care about. Basically the visual equivalent of \"in one ear and out the other\".\n\nPart of this is definitely due to the fact that every episode is two minutes long, with only about 70% of it being actual content due to a five-second long opening slate and a 30-second long ED (approximately). There's almost literally no time to even absorb anything is happening, because everything is so rapid-fire that it washes over incredibly easy. Even multi-part episodes suffer from this. It would have honestly been better to split it up into four-minute episodes, or even eight-minute episodes, because at least then you can realize an episode is happening. Even poor slife-of-life anime get by with so-so paced 24-minute episodes; two-minute episodes where a thing happens is beyond the pale.\n\nIt does some things serviceable at least, in a way that doesn't make this anime feel like an actual waste of time. Yuuko Konagai and Azumi Shiratori may not be great characters, but they're done fine enough with at least a bit of interest that it's fine (and also have cute interactions together, more cute than anything else in the show). The, uh, arc with Ran Iketani, the girl who's scared of cats, is amusing while it lasts. The ED should be annoying but it ends up being catchy (I still have it stuck in my head even now) and at least has serviceable visuals for it. Aurally, it has a bouncy and bubbly sound design (but especially when the cats are the focus) that it makes up for the lackluster art. Two of the four cats are distinctive. The anime is so short that even if you find it dreadful, you won't have even spent half-an-hour on it. The voice acting was okay.\n\nReally it's hard to name what I like about it when there's so little to care about that I have to stretch myself to name positive aspects. But it's enough to not make it a bad anime, just really mediocre. A lot of it comes down to its awful pacing of two-minute episodes, but even if that were fixed, it'd still be really unmemorable and nothing more than a blip in my memory to remember to possibly check out the manga, if I could ever find the time to do so. So it has some benefits, just not many. If you're that into slice-of-life that you need to watch as much as you can from the genre, or have a spare half-hour you can't spend starting/continuing another anime, then you at least have this. Otherwise, there's too little of value to even passingly recommend. But hey, cats. "}, {"id": 2509, "score": 30, "body": "Gakkou Gurashi is very interesting to say the least. Over the years, there have been countless slice of life anime, and countless horror/thriller anime, but rarely do we get something that tries to combine the two in an attempt to amplify each other. The last time I watched something that relied this heavily on tonal shifts, was with Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, an anime that utilised thriller in-between the slice of life and the horror, as a means of creating suspense. Higurashi, although it visually wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t impressive to say the least, delivered in my opinion rather well. Question is, did Gakkou Gurashi the same?\n\nThe story is fairly plain and simple. Post apocalypse, merely weeks after a zombie outbreak, a collective of 4 students and a teacher, has created a shelter at a high school where they go about their daily activities, occasionally heading outside to search for food or survivors. What Gakkou Gurashi does to spice up the setting, is that the main character, Yuki Takeyaka, has entered a sense of delusional denial, in which se perceives the world around her in the way she want to; The show seems to take place during spring break whiles\u00e2\u0080\u0099t our main cast has decided to spend the vacation at school. The rest of the cast has agreed to keep Yuki in the gray, largely because she acts as moral support for the rest in this rather dark and grim setting. The story, although fairly simple, is quite effective at what it tries to do, although it sticks to a rather formulaic apocalypse storyline: The main cast begins as refugees, find a safe shelter that by the end of the story will turn out to be not as safe as we thought it to be. What most people are going to notice at first, is how episodes 1-10 are spendt on the shelter phase, in which the story is reduced to slice of life fluff, like it or hate it...\n\nWhat drew me to the story was the concept of tonal shifts. To easier explain, I'm going to reference Higurashi, which I consider a masterpiece within the thriller genre. Higurashi takes it's time, starting each story arc with slice of life comedy which slowly but assuredly turns into a nightmare'esque setting. The sense of thrill one would get from Higurashi comes from the fact that you know shit's about to hit the fan, you just don't know when. Gakkou Gurashi does a far too god job at displaying what the core differences between the thriller and the horror genre is. Gakkou Gurashi, instead of carefully poking at the viewer before striking, decides to strike at random. Unfortunately this backfires sligtly. Horror and Moe are two far too different genres to be able to pull of horror. With two genres this different, the medium has to ease the viewers transition from on genre to the other, instead of rushing it like Gakkou Gurashi does. And yes, I said rushing, because you don't have the time to adjust your brain to the tonal shifts, so you as the viewer are left partially laughing whiles't people are dying. It's more of a schizophrenic experience than anything.\n\nMy major complaint about the story however, is how a lot of the key elements make little to no sense at all. The most obvious one, which the show actually pokes fun at (which does repair a tiny tid bit of the damage done), is how the rooftop of the school in which our main cast lives at, is built with a massive garden, solar cell panels, water heating tanks, a pool and a fucking water collecting system, all enough to sustain a dozen people or so with food, water and electricity. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as if the school was built with a zombie outbreak in mind. At least, the school I go to doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have that level of security equipment. \n\nThe way the show goes about characterising it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s characters is quite interesting! The 5 main characters all seem to be moduled after the 5 stages of death or grief, as described by psychiatrist Elisabeth K\u00c3\u00bcbler-Ross; Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression and Acceptance, similar to how the Espada from Bleach symbolised an aspect of death.\n\n1. Denial : \"In the state of denial, the subject convinces h*mself that the reality he is facing is a mistake, and clings to the false preferable fictiation\". As mentioned before, main character Yuki is in a delusional state, denying that the zombie outbreak ever happened. She is the bright and cheerful of the bunch, but also the naive and childish.\n\n2. Anger : \"After having realised that the reality you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a mistake, most people in pain feel angered. That their reality is somewhat unfair. Manny seek to lash out on others, often as a means of protecting themselves\" Kurumi is literally walking around with a sharpened shovel on her back, ready to whack whomever comes too close, and you could say this is her way to vent frustration out on others. She is the more aggresive and protective of the bunch, never afraid to be in the frontline of a confrontation.\n\n3. Bargaining : \"After having the reality pushed onto you, many seeks to cheat their way out of it. They look everywhere for an easier way out of the crisis\". Miki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story arc revolves around how she and her friend had sought shelter at a mall, and how the dull waiting drove her friend to leave safety to search for somewhere else to stay. The story constantly jumps back and forth with Miki thinking to herself what she could have done different, and what she can do now, to ease the situation for herself and the others.\n\n4. Depression : \"Many experience depression as a result of not being able to bargain their way out of a crisis\". A common outcome of depression is the mental disease melancholy, characterised by apathy and sombreness. Yuuri seems to be the impersonation of melancholy. She is constantly giving of a faint smile as to cheer the others up, but deep inside, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s truly depressed, on the brink of insanity. Although she tries to act as the metal support for the rest of the group, she is in many ways the weakest and the one in the most dire need.\n\n5. Acceptance : \"After having come to terms with the reality, most experience acceptance, often as a result of not seing any better way out. It is simply the best out of many bad\". Megumi, without delving too far into spoilers, seems to be the only character with her head straight. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s calm and collected (compared to the others), and serves the rolle as the emotionally stable of the bunch, being the one that managed to secure the school building for the others to live in. That coupled with some carefully displayed imagery, namely the cross she wears in a necklace around her neck, symbolising death, and the fact that she is a teacher. Someone more emotionally stable than the students.\n\nUnfortunately, a good concept does not make for good characters. Similar to how the Espada from Bleach act as mere obstacles (although based on an interesting concept), outside of the K\u00c3\u00bcbler-Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0099 model, the cast from Gakkou Gurashi don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have too much going for them either. The show does acknowledge the tropes by the usage of imagery, but tends to \"forget\" this in favour for moe fluff, which I've seen before and done better at that. They lack the charm, flavour and diversity that the cast of say, K-On has. Yes, most of the girls have had to go through tragic events in which they were borderline mentally torn apart, but with the exception of events, there is little to none character-development, characterisation nor fluctuation. Bland characters isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily a problem, say the adventure genre, but this show relies heavily on it, because it is a slice of life. Having 5 copy paste characters, although based on interesting tropes/concepts, just simply isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t good enough, for me at least. I need more depth or substance. A good concept does not make for a good character.\n\nThe art is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Ok\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 There honestly isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much to talk about. Although fairly well done, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any characteristics to separate it from any other anime within it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s genre. Although studio Lerche to me seem to be fairly competent at what they do, creating 3 shows for one season is a little over the top. There are shortcuts quite often, although fairly well disguised by, for example, having characters face away from the camera while talking, etc. Credits given where credits due, the CGI used in the anime, in particular for the hordes of zombies was actually very good! There was actual effort put into having the CGI fit in with the 2D animation, and I think it added to the unsettling nature of the zombies.\n\nThe soundtrack is the shows strongest side. Although most of the music is very bland, with an opening in typical catchy j-pop style and with most of the tracks being run of the mill background tracks, the best parts was during the although short horror pieces. From the sombre melodies, to the erie piano tracks, it was all great means of amplifying the thrill. Another thing I have to compliment it for, is it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of complete and utter silence, or in some cases, the usage of as simple sounds as the rain pouring down. Although it is a shame that 95% of the anime is spent at the school in a bright and cheerful soundtrack, one which you could find in any other slice of life moe out there. Bland, uninspired and painfully mediocre are the first words I can come up with to describe it. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to comment on the voice acting, as I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t speak japanese, and I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be watching the dub (if one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ever made) because none-asian women are biologically incapable of doing moe.\n\nGoing back to the foreword, Gakkou Gurashi was interesting. Opening the anime up with a main character whose quite obviously delusional. The sense of thill I got from the anime, was waiting to see her world crumble, as she was being forced to accept the way her current reality actually is. Which coincidentally, never happened\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The whole cool factor, came from the fact that this was seemingly just a run of the mill slice of life for the first few episodes, until episode 5 or so when the viewer received the whole \u00e2\u0080\u009coh my\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d experience, realising that this anime is actually really fucked up. But after that point, it felt like the show did all it could to avoid what little made it stand out from the oversaturated moe market. I honestly got bored quite often. Although the few horror scenes we got were quite good, with a masterfully erie soundtrack to boot, they were too few, short and far between.\n\nTo conclude, I was quite saddened by the delivery of Gakkou Gurashi. There was so much potential, but most of it got lost in the overuse of moe. Gakkou Gurashi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s major downfall is, and will always be, the fact that it sets itself up as an anime that relies on shifting between two completely different tones, horror and slice of life moe, but after having introduced the horror, avoids it as if it was the plague. As the show goes on, I just get more and more convinced that the story/horror was an afterthought, and that the initial intention was a moe school comedy. It is almost as if they try to overshadow a mediocre slice of life, by using horror. I honestly cannot give you a good reason to watch this over K-On! (as a better moe) or Higurashi (as a better horror experience). Taking the Madoka Magica approach with calling this a Moe deconstruction would be giving it too much credit. I'd say it is a sub-par delivery of an interesting concept. It's not bad, it's just an over-glorified moe. Being a moe isn't in itself bad, but trying to disguise yourself as something else, is bad.\n\nThere is in MY OPINION little to no reason to watch this. It's individual settings and genres has been done elsewhere, and better at that, and the only reason this is worth checking out, is to see the blend of the different elements. There are unfortunately rather few anime that blends horror genre with moe setting, thus this at least has a way to stick out from the crowd. It still has enough unique elements to have a reason to exist. I'd say check out the first episode, as you should be able to figure out the general gist of the show by the end of it. For all I know, you may enjoy it a lot more than I did, hopefully at that."}, {"id": 2510, "score": 30, "body": "I have to go very much out of my usual formula to review Kekkai Sensen, because it is a rather complicated case\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 This is also going to be a very quick review, seeing as the shows \u00e2\u0080\u009cflaws\u00e2\u0080\u009d are huge, and can be summarised quickly.\n\nFor starters, the show looks AMAZING, and is in my opinion the best looker of spring 2015. What truly sells the visuals is the directing. It gives of a sense of uncontrollable energy and fun, which upped the overall score for visuals quite the bit. The soundtrack is also pretty sweet. I actually found myself listening through the opening, instead of skipping through it, just because how amazing the song is. Same goes for the ending. Simply put, very listenable. As for the rest of the soundtrack, your usual mediocre background tracks sprinkled with some great standout tracks in-between for good measure ^_^\n\nTalking about the story is the hardest part. After watching each episode, I had myself thinking; \u00e2\u0080\u009cMan, that was a great episode!\u00e2\u0080\u009d. The comedy is on point, the plot was amusing, the characters were entertaining, the shows structure was original (see recap episode 10.5), etc.. Overall a great show! And this worked out very well for the first 7 or so episodes, but after that point, one thing in particular became very apparent. Every episode feels like a separate work on its own, with only the main cast and the location to tie them together. There is no semblance of a story at all. One episode ends with the main cast looking over an army of demons, the next has our main character bribing a mushroom with hamburgers. What little there is of a story is basicly, New York is surrounded by a fog that has connected the demon world to the \"human world\". How? We're never told... In this new New York, monsters and humans have to co-exist. In the midsts of all this, our main protagonist has decided to move to New York, where after a series of coincidences, begins working for Libra, an organisation centered around keeping threats at bay. Aaand thats about it... There is hinted towards a story from time to another; the world is threatened by vampires, Leonard has self-doubt issues, Libra is a group of misfits trying to make a living, etc. but it is all so very subtile, until it is slapped straight in our face like a plot twist. The thing is, it is not a plot twist, just a speedy plot point. My major gripe here, is that it feels like the story is being sidetracked for comedy, or rather filler episodes, which have no place in a 12ep show. It could have been along the lines of character centric episodes, but the aforementioned \"filler episodes\" are merely arbitrary comedy skeets...\n\nYou could make the argument that Kekkai Sensen is a \u00e2\u0080\u009dslice of nothing ever happens\u00e2\u0080\u009d comedy, and should be judged accordingly, but the show occasionally, tries hard to get its story across the board, and thus has to be judged as so. If Kekkai Sensen had been something along the lines of Kara no Kyoukai or Haruhi Suzumiya, where the episodes were not released chronologically, then the aforementioned ridiculously bad pacing and poorly tied together story could have been due to me just not understanding the plot due to unconventional conveying, but I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even put the blame on such  a scenario.\n\nAs for the characters, there are just too many of them. But they all have two things in common. They are all based on character tropes, and they are all ridiculously two dimensional. I could go in depth (or as far as possible with the rather limited personality each and everyone were given) about each and every character, but instead il just list a few of the main. You hardly need anything more than this before you know everything about the characters. You have your run of the mill easygoing main character (Leonard Watch), the asshole (Zapp), the tough but straight guy (Klaus), deluded villain (Femt), obligatory love interest (Mary/White) and the whimp (William/Black). To the shows credit, episode 11 is pure characterisation, telling about the past of some of the main characters, but it is very much a \"too little, too late\" scenario. Instead, they should have put this episode closer to the mid-point. Indeed, it could take some of the suspense away from the anime, but at least the story would have been a tiny bit less non-sensical.\n\nTo summarise, Kekkai Sensen is a show that had a lot of potential. Every episode in and of itself were great, but the episodes themselves had no semblance of connection. The show falls flat on its face due to horrible pacing, limited character characterisation, little to none character development and a too short of a runtime. Say, if Kekkai Sensen had received a 26 episode runtime, the MABY the characters and the story would have had the time to be fully fletched out, instead of being the rushed mess that it is. The shows main selling points are definitively the animation, music and comedy, and with the exception of the aforementioned being great, there is very little to talk about... Kekkai Sensen could have been great, but ultimately is a rushed mess, and the final episode being posponed indefinitely further underlines that statement"}, {"id": 2511, "score": 30, "body": "I want to preface by saying that in this review, I will largely distinguish between the Aincrad arc and the Fairy Dance arc, seeing as how they are two separate stories and\nvastly different in narrative style.

The first of the arcs take place in a near future, wherein after years of research into virtual reality, a game by the name of Sword Art Online has been set to launch. What separates SAO from other VR games, is that instead of trying to immerse the viewer through visual, physical and auditory stimuli, it instead takes the player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consciousness into the game itself.\nThe launch of the game is set to have 10k players that managed to get the limited nerve-gear, the VR gear or what have you, where in-game the players soon notice a complete inability to log out. In a very thrilling scene, the game\u00e2\u0080\u0099s creator, Kayaba Akihiko, reveals that they are now trapped in a game of life and death, in which the players have to clear the 100 floors of the game, with an ever so slight twist. If you die in the game, you die for real. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soon after revealed that if the nerve-gear is forcefully removed, a mechanical micro-wave trap is set to pretty much fry their brain. Our hero Kirito goes on to join the \u00e2\u0080\u009cclearing squad\u00e2\u0080\u009d, a group of elite warriors set on completing the 100 floors and returning to the real world, where he meets amongst others Asuna, one of the other main characters. The story implements amongst others, themes of jealousy as normal players fear and detest beta-testers, as they feel they have an unfair advantage and are egotistical people whom only care for themselves. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a brilliant setup as a sclock action that is equally intriguing as it is fascinating from a sci-fi perspective.\n\nThe second arc, Fairy Dance takes place just two months after the Aincrad incident, where the vast majority of the survivors are either hospitalised or doing rehab after being mentally tormented in Aincrad. Sadly, not all the players have escaped the terror yet, as about 300 players are still in a state of comatose, Asuna being one amongst them. The game engine for Sword Art Online and the nerve-gear development kit has been bought by a company under the name of RECT Inc. which is headed by Asuna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father. During one of Kirito\u00e2\u0080\u0099s many times visiting Asuna at the hospital,\nKirito meets Asuna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father and the head of the research institution at RECT, Sugou Nobuyuki. Turns out Asuna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father has plans of marrying Sugou to her in one week, so that Sugou will inherit the company. This places Kirito on a one week timer to find a way to wake Asuna up from the comatose so that she can deny the marriage. The following day, Kirito is sent a screenshot from the new virtual reality mmorpg, ALfheim Online, where a figure that distinctly resembles Asuna can be seen, which drives Kirito to enter this new game in an attempt to save Asuna before the marriage is to take place, teaming up with amongst others his sister.\n\nThe narrative of Sword Art Online has a very heavy focus on adventure, which is one of the stronger element to the story. The worlds of Aincrad and ALfheim are massive and filled to the brim with content. The worlds are nothing short of beautiful, and I actually felt an incentive to explore these worlds. I would actually have wanted to take part of this adventure, had it not been for the whole perma-death thing. \nIn the video game industry, there exists this little term known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cludo-narrative dissonance\u00e2\u0080\u009d, which in short terms means that the gameplay and the story is in direct conflict with each other. A more recent example would be Fallout 4 where the story is about rushing to find your son, whiles\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the gameplay entices exploring the world and following the main story whenever you feel like. Similarly with the story of SAO, you would expect the clearing squad to be carefully planning their advances ahead because actual lives are at stake, but we see them often running head first in to something that can otherwise be described as a massacre. Likewise, you would expect everyone to use their off time, grinding lower level monsters for experience, but half of the first arc is about establishing a more mellow tone with minigames and side-activities that ultimately don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t yeald any substantional reward.\n\nThe characters are what most commonly receives criticism, from fans and non-fans alike, and the vast majority of those problems derive from how the story attempts to portray the protagonist Kirito. Describing Kirito without talking about his actions is pretty hard, seeing as he is nothing short of bland and boring, with a side dish of inconsistency. The few times the show tries to give him any kind of depth, it shoots itself of by having him be the edgiest, moodiest teen ever since Wit. studio became a thing. The show almost acnowledges it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lack of ability to progress Kirito\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character, so it introduces a character in the form of Kirito and Asuna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s artificial inteligence daughter Yui to do the developing for them. The most noteworthy example of inconsistency would be the incident wherein Kirito announces himself as a Beater, essentially announcing himself and all other beta-testers as villains, and painting a massive target over his face. The Kirito we \u00e2\u0080\u009cknow\u00e2\u0080\u009d would try to reason with the others in his shy demeanour, but the Kirito in this scene acts pompous and witty, and although it is supposed to be Kirito putting on an act, the act only understates that all beta-testers must be feared, and forces Kirito into hiding his power-level from other players for a while, because he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the dumbass that threw the rock that created the rockslide.\n\nThe fact that Kirito is portrayed as so ridiculously overpowered, is probably what is the spawn of the vast majority of plot-holes in Aincrad. Kirito at a fairly early point in the game join a small team of far lower levelled players, whom he trains with for a while. Whilest they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re training, Kirito has to hide his level due to the whole beater incident, but we as viewers can see that his level is about double theirs. Whiles\u00e2\u0080\u0099t paying with them, Kirito levels about twice as fast, which would be impossible, seeing as a normal mmorpg would have some kind of exp-share system, and even though such a system were to not be present, the exp-target on higher levels should be far greater than the exp-target on lower levels. And because he hid his level, his teammates get overly-confident, and waltz straight into a trap which kills everyone but Kirito, because of his inability to communicate with his friends, which determins Kirito to party on his own from now on, which should in any mmorpg stunt his exp gain. To add further insult to injury, the incident is never resolved, having Kirito be trapped, before doing yet another time-skip in which Kirito no longer is inside the dungeon. How did he get out? Throught he powers of deus-ex machina? Kirito actually has several deus-ex machina incidents throughout Aincrad, another being how already in the first episode, it is stated that players have no perception of pain in this game, yet we are on several occasions treated to torture scenes which lack any and all impact because we KNOW that nobody is getting hurt. There is no pain sensory. A third one would be how during a boss raid in which the people Kirito is playing with are getting demolished by the boss, so he decides to use a dual wielding skill to destroy the\nboss. Why didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he do so earlier? Delaying showing of the skill cost the lives of many people. After the fight has been resolved, he gets questioned about how he got the skill, and simply replies with \u00e2\u0080\u009cit was just there one day\u00e2\u0080\u009d. You mean to tell me the single most over-powered skill in the game is\nunique to Kirito, and he go it out of nowhere without doing anything? That is as close to the definition of plot convenience as one can get. Another noteworthy scene, although not related to plot-holes, is when Kirito gets jumped by 7 guys whom manage to output less dps than Kirito\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hp-regeneration, obliterating any sense of tension there was. \n\nAn attribute to Kirito being overpowered, is how ignorant or stupid the rest of the player base seems to be. It is establised fairly early that in SAO there are about 10.000 players, and that about 1000 players were beta-testers. Yet no-one except Asuna come even remotely close to the power of\nKirito. Sword Art Online was supposedly the most hyped game of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s are, and the 10.000 copies of the nerve-gear were sold out within hours. Yet Kirito has to exposit the mechanics of a rather basic mmorpg to whomever the fuck he comes across. The vast majority of players seem to have never\ntouched a game before. And although the beta-testers take up 1/10th of the player base, yet Kirito NEVER stumble across any players that could be considered at a skill where they could have been beta-testers. The only one that comes anywhere close to Kirito in skill, is Asuna, and she states\nduring her first encounter with Kirito that she knows fuck all about mmorpg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, let alone SAO.\n\nAt last there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Asuna. Although Asuna is somewhat straight forward tsundere, with little to nothing to differentiate her from the overly-saturated tsundere-waifu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s there are. What Asuna lacks in originality, she makes up with incredible fluidity, vibrance and believability. Reminder that the difference between inconsistency and vibrance being one is a characters personality limiting it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s options and then choosing the one that does not correspond with personality, whiles\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the other is a characters personality enabling more options. The aforementioned traits are what makes for some absolutely fantastic character interactions, seeing how despite Kirito having no personality at all, Asuna is still able to create chemistry between the two. The relationship between Kirito and Asuna is ironically better than the relationships displayed in the vast majority of romance anime, and it is solely due to the character of Asuna, and it in the scenes with Asuna that Kirito displays what is called faint signs of human emotion and the ability to interact with other human beings. It is also a rare feat to see characters entering a functioning relationship in an anime without it ending with someone getting blue-balled. Now, sadly I have to say that Asuna is still largely an attribute to Kirito as the vast majority of her actions are either affected or as a result of Kirito\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions. Asuna is still THE redeeming feature to Aincrad, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fucking shame she plays little to no role in Fairy Dance except to be mutilated and serve as a reward for Kirito. What was the anime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s saviour and the one player that was on par with Kirito in strength, is reduced to nothing but a damsel in distress, and makes what could have been the better of the two arcs far less enjoyable than the former.\n\nFairy Dance only introduces one major character, in the form of Kirito\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sister, Kirigaya Suguha, or Leafa as she is know in the game. Sadly, she is extremely arbitrary, as in if you completely remove her from the story, nothing would change, with the small exception that there would be a lot less exposition as she serves the role as narrator for the majority of the story, or dare I say, info-dumper. For the vast majority of the journey through ALfheim, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing more but a bystander, with the exception of one incident where she acts as support from Kirito as he goes on to fight 12 people of a rivalling race, before turning into a demon and demolishing the 12. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love to say I knew why or how he turned into a demon, but Kirito himself states that he does not know how it happened, and the power never becomes relevant ever again. If Kirito had just used \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe power of plot convenience\u00e2\u0080\u009d earlier, he could have easily defeated them without Suguha, rendering her only useful appearance arbitrary. She only serve the purpose of falling in love with Kirito, to ultimately get heartbroken.\n\nLets go over the two villains of Sword Art Online, Kayaba Akihiko and Sugou Nobuyuki. Before talking about them on an individual level, I wish to go over a villains purpose in any clich\u00c3\u00a9 protagonist vs. antagonist story, and what differentiates a good from a bad character in this scenario. In making a protagonist or antagonist, there are three major ways one can fuck it up.\n\n1. Have the character lack a motive : For the character to be effective, the viewer must be able to root for him; to be immersed. Easiest way to do this, is by having a clich\u00c3\u00a9 revenge plot, in which the character is out to punish those whom has done him unjust.\n\n2. Have the character have a too strong motive : Although the viewer must be able to root for the character, there must also be an incentive for the villain to be the one to loose in the end. The easiest way to pull this off, is to have him be \u00e2\u0080\u009cevil\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood\u00e2\u0080\u009d. If we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about a protagonist vs. antagonist; having the protagonist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motive be more justificable than that of the antagonist. But on the other hand, if the character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motives are made ridiculous to the point that the viewer looses the ability to resonate with him, he looses all sense of believability, and becomes either laughable or edgy.\n\n3. Have the character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motives conflict with one and another or be overly-complex : A good protagonist or antagonist is one whom has a motive, either for personal gain, or for the gain of a society, group or individual whom he cares for. Although the character can stray from his path during the journey, the ultimate goal should be one that is fairly precise and easy to understand. If you make the villains goal overly-complex or the derivative of a series of motives, the story becomes unfocused and much less immersive. Either that or pretentious.\n\nKayaba Akihiko for the most part plays the rolle of \u00e2\u0080\u009cmysterious villain\u00e2\u0080\u009d. We know nothing of his motives, who he is or his backstory. Remember how I said Aincrad had a heavy focus on adventure? Well, as the conclusion of SAO nears, our heroes are still only at the 25th floor, rendering 25% of the adventure unexplored. In one of the biggest buzzkills ever, Kayaba challenges Kirito to a one on one duel which ends in Kirito\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favour, ultimately stealing away 25% of the adventure away from the viewer. Essentially promised content is being taken away from us as viewers. The arc also ends on a massive anti-chlimax, in which Kirito gets the opportunity to talk to Kayaba and ask him about his motivation for killing all these players, and Kayaba reveals how \u00e2\u0080\u009che has long forgotten the reason\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Last time I checked, people rarely forget why they commit genocide against a culture (gaming culture this time around). The only thing we know about Kayaba in the end, is that he is a scientist that developed a game to kill people. He is the \u00e2\u0080\u009cevil\u00e2\u0080\u009d obstacle that the protagonist has to clear.\n\nSugou Nobuyuki is a clusterfuck on a whole other level. Back to how I in the definition of a villain said that if you overdo the villain, he ends up as either pathetic or edgy. Sugou is just that; Kirito\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motivation to rescue Asuna is of course because he loves her, whiles\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Sugou\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motivation to keep her in ALfheim is for economical gain. If he manages to convince her to marry him, he inherits the company which he is 2nd in charge of currently. Okay, perfect. We have a villain with his motivations and a protagonist with his motivations. The villain is out for personal economical gain, whiles\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the protagonist is out for love. But instead of having the point come to an end from here, this ridiculous plot about brain-washing the players and taking over the world is introduced, and Sugou is also made to be a sadist with a fetish for sadomasochism. There was no need to have S&M in a children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anime about a teenager saving his girlfriend in a video-game. It just makes for a painful and degrading watching experience, as the S&M scenes are drawn to look almost erotic. The whole arc about world dominance is also more confusing that intriguing. He obliterates the perfect balance of good vs. evil, and becomes the overly-despicable, impossible to resonate with, confusing villain.\n\nThe \u00e2\u0080\u009cguidelines for a main character\u00e2\u0080\u009d obviously apply to Kirito as well. During the entirety of Sword Art Online, Kirito is pretty much walking around without purpose nor reasoning. He is not part of a team, he is not part of the clearing squad, he has no goals in mind whatshowever. There is no incentive to care about Kirito. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d much rather watch any other member of the clearing squad. Most people that have watched SAO, will say that during the ALfheim arc, Kirito feels like a better protagonist whom is much more emotionally present. This is largely due to how during ALfheim, Kirito actually has a goal in mind. A driving force if you will. And although the motive in fairy dance is rather clich\u00c3\u00a9, at leas there is a motive. The motive makes it easier to relate or resonate with Kirito, but he still lacks human emotions, he is still in-able to communicate with other human beings and he is still as inconsistent as in Aincrad\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m somewhat torn about the visuals in Sword Art Online. On one hand, Sword Art Online features some of the best artwork I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen, he character models look fantastic, the particle effects look for the most part great and the overall consistency of the visuals is fairly high (shots fired at Manglobe). And although some of the disproportionate figures, especially faces, have become memes on the internet over the years because of how ridiculous people think they are, they added a lot of impact and power to the frames. On the other hand, the cinematography had a tendency to crumble during fighting scenes, especially those featuring more than two characters slugging it out. Whenever more than two characters were present on-screen, most of them would be still-framed, and in stead of animation, there would be shaky-cam effects and poorly displaced particle effects, notoriously the horizontal lines that would go from one end to the other of the screen, making the screen even more confusing. As for the one on one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, although from an animation and art standpoint, the choreography and the particle effects are still all over the place. Also noteworthy regarding shot composition; As an attribute to the anime trying to portray Kirito as a badass, the fight scenes had a tendency to focus on him, regardless of the enemy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s size. Be it an enemy at the same size of Kirito, this would work out perfectly, but if the enemy is something along the lines of a 15foot monster, half of the opponent would be put off-screen, making the already clustered cinematography even more confusing. One could consider the scenes as experimental, but if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so, then A1\u00e2\u0080\u0099s freelancers bit an apple too big to chew.\n\nOh, the soundtrack\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Where do I begin? The soundtrack is entirely done by Yuki Kajiura, so there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already reason to have high expectations, and I can confirm that the soundtrack is the second best thing in Sword Art Online, after Asuna of course. Although the soundtrack is somewhat textbook fantasy adventure, the execution and the finesse that Yuki Kajiura adds is what it makes it stand out from the rest, and it actually had me mesmerising back to when I was younger when I watched the first Narnia movie for the first time! Sadly there are very few standout tracks from the bunch\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 On the other hand, if the soundtrack doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t interest you, then at least the openings are sure to do so!\n\nWith the general basis for the anime laid forth, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to start tearing the story of Sword Art Online apart. Take note on how I will still be separating the Aincrad arc and the Fairy Dance arc, as they serve different purpose and approach to narrative. Before tearing the story apart, know that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a total cognitive dissonance between the two stories, in which during the Aincrad arc, the clearing team is rushing through dungeons with all their forces, loosing hundreds of men in the process, when they could have taken their time on the lower levels, farming low level monsters until they would be able to overpower the higher levels. On the other hand, during the Fairy Dance arc, Kirito is being placed on a one week timer, whiles\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for the most part, it feels like he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dicing around doing fuck all. This is extremely contradicting to the message the two arcs try to give the viewer. Whiles\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Fairy Dance is a rather straight forward adventure about hero saving damsel in distress, Aincrad actually had a message. People were actually enjoying themselves in Sword Art Online, even though they were in many ways trapped. Some even preferred this world over the real one. There is never any sense of urgency in Fairy Dance, where there should be, whiles\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in Alfheim, there is an urgency without reasoning. Now, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had people say that people having trust in virtual-reality mmorpg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s after the SAO incident is ridiculous, but as a comparison, people still fly in planes after 9/11, so I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find it to be that impossible. I do on the other hand find it strange that they would use the exact same game engine as SAO, and it might have taken a few years before people would fully trust it again, but I digress.\n\nFirstly, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tear apart the actual game that is Sword Art Online. Over the years I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve played my fair share of mmorpg, and the only one I can think of that closely resembles the game mechanics of SAO, is RuneScape, which comparing SAO to RuneScape is the only way I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m able to have the game\u00e2\u0080\u0099s design approach make sense. But the mechanics as an mmorpg make no sense at all. In any traditional mmorpg, partying with other players is far more effective exp wise, than going alone, which is  where I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m referring to RuneScape which is largely a single player experience. SAO, with a complete lack of any quests, tasks or challenges is a grinding mmorpg, and although there are some quests, etc. RuneScape is largely a grinding game as well. Yet, to defeat anything with a higher level than you, it is advised to team up with friedly players, yet Kirito manages to essentially single handedly crush any boss, wether equal or far above his level. Once again Kirito being overpowered crashes with the story.\n\nThe narrative in the Aincrad arc is a cluster-fuck to say the least, spending time on filler, before taking massive time-skips, skipping over content vital to the context of several key events. Referring to the incident in which Kirito announced himself as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cBeater\u00e2\u0080\u009d, without having resolved being branded a villain, Kirito is becomes a vital member of the the clearing squad in-between two episodes, having me as a viewer ask myself questions like \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen did he join?\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow was he granted admission?\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he receiving any backlash?\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and so forth. A lot of the bonding between Kirito and Asuna is also being skipped, jumping from being mere party members one episode, to sharing beds in the next one, implying that the writers don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how do character bonding and development, thus outright skipping it. This being a particularly massive shame, seeing as the relationship between Kirito and Asuna is easily the strongest part of the anime due to how strong Asuna is as a character. Also, a great deal of the narrative outright does not make any sense. Call them plot holes if you will. Take the basis of SAO as a whole, the nerve gear. From what we know, the nerve-gear has a built in radio-wave-mechanic that basically fries your brain if you either 1. die in-game or 2. have your helmet be forcefully removed. Later in the anime, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re introduced to the mechanic of reviving other players within a time-period of 30-seconds (a mechanic never taken into effect). Does that mean that the nerve-gear waits 30-seconds before frying your brain on death? To me, it seems as the nerve-gear and virtual-reality mmorpg are afterthoughts on how to make the scenarios that take place in SAO possible, which could have been taken care of by having this be a by the book fantasy setting.\n\nALfheim Online, although a direct product of Sword Art Online\u00e2\u0080\u0099s game engine, features slightly different mechanics from those Sword Art Online had, namely there are several races which all feature distinct design approaches which differentiate them enough to serve as different classes, and all the skills and items from SAO has been rendered invalid in ALfheim. Those familiar with the Elder Scrolls series will be familiar with the race design approach. Similar to the mmorpg Elder Scrolls Online, the different races serve as different clans or kingdoms, with the ability to engage war on each and another.  Despite all the skills from SAO supposedly being invalid in ALfheim, Kirito is still able to dual-wield, and even refers to an attack as a skill at one point. Although ALfheim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core mechanics make a great deal more sense than those of SAO, they as well start to crumble the further we get into the story. In particular during episode 21, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a worldwide server maintenance, in which all the players are forcefully logged out. During the downtime, Asuna is still able to move around freely (for some inexplicable reason), and uses the opportunity to escape the birdcage in which she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been locked in. Sneaking around the tops of the three branches, it never occurs to her that she can jump of the branches and fly down to the main land, but instead she heads into the core of the three, where she finds a loophole opportunity to log out. Hesitating to press the log-out button, she gets mutilated in one of the most un-called for scenes in anime history. It served no purpose to the narrative, it was not comedic and it was not erotic (nor is SAO erotic by any means), yet it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s there, only to catch the viewer of guard. On top of that, the result of all of this bullshit, is that she get\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thrown back into the birdcage, rendering the entire unpleasantry pointless. On top of that, scenes like this has no place in an anime like this. A clich\u00c3\u00a9 children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fantasy story has noting to do with tentacle rape or sadomasocism. They manage to ruin the mmorpg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s believability by adding an arbitrary unpleasantry.\n\nSword Art Online\u00e2\u0080\u0099s is far from horrible, despite what the haters say. On the other hand, it is far from god\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gift to mankind as the fans have branded it. From a literary perspective, it manages to fuck things up in about every way possible. However, the strong soundtrack and fantastic artwork redeems the anime quite a bit, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say it is still one of the more watchable out there despite the flaws, and I personally think that everyone should watch it, wether it be for pure entertainment reasons, or as a means of training your analytical skills, because Sword Art Online truly is the pinnacle of horrible writing.\n\nSword Art Online will to me forever be the perfect example of how to adapt a work: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf the source material is awful, change it\u00e2\u0080\u009d. If the same amount of effort put into the visuals and the soundtrack was put into the script and characters, Sword Art Online could have become amongst the greatest within\nthe fantasy adventure genre."}, {"id": 2516, "score": 10, "body": "__~~~The show that gave me a new term for a certain pet peeve. ~~~\n__\nI have been watching anime for a long time.

That is where I am with the faces in Kakugurui. \nThese issues with obnoxious faces is nothing new for me. I have the same feelings for Daily Lives of High School Boys and Drifters. But Kakegurui has achieved a level of obnoxious faces into a territory that has not been explored that I shall deem as egregious faces. \n\nThe show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s art style is presented in a way that resembles sadistic hentai with these faces. I for one am not a masochist nor a sadist that will get enjoyment from an entertainment medium that way. I also am not a hentai fan so when you add the sweat and the lips/drool that helps take it to that egregious level. \n\nThis shows theme is based on a school where gambling gets you to the top of the totem pole. I for one am someone who likes the game of poker. I watch the World Series of Poker every year. I even had a favorite poker player in Phil Hellmuth. So I was optimistic that at least like the action in Drifters I can find satisfaction in the gambling of the show. \n\nUnfortunately the gambling we got was a mix of redundant themes and girls over-powering on masochism. But even if the gambling was more satisfactory it is hard to enjoy any battle of strategy when your bombarded by egregious faces left and right. \n\nBy this point I already had all these negative feelings towards Yumeko. Queue stage left a Yumeko on steroids named Midari Ikishima. During her dedicated episodes is where I just lost all hope for this show because when you put the theme of death into the show that changes everything. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t about riding the economic train to the top of a gambling school. Your bringing in the theme that you can actually die in this school. That was the moment the stake went into  the heart for the setting. \n\nMidari is also apart of the student council that are the main villains of the show. They are a conglomerate of individuals that have come together to hold a monopoly on the school. The basis of the show is for Yumeko to take them down one by one. The entirety of the show continues to try and make the student council even more sadistic than Yumeko herself. They try to establish a higher-level sadism that is not accepted to make you not like these characters. But if you already have Yumeko pass that level the effect is just completely negated. \n\nBasically every character was doing these gambling orgasms. It is the same issue the entire show. Even when they gave me an architype that I tend to enjoy in a villain in glasses. The enthusiasm dwindled away quite quickly thanks to once again from Yumeko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orgasms. So I can confidently say that the Characters, Enjoyment, and Art are all a 1 out of 10. \n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already covered how the setting is decapitated. But we do have progression. There is an end game to the show. They do not waste much time with frivolous OVA content. That is something I can put up as a 2 out of 10. Now bringing it up to a 3 out of 10 is another story. There was a lot of empty transition from going to the next student council member. There also was never a proper hierarchy build out so I can understand the level of difficulty increasing. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really have much time to build up to it though. Their goal seemed to be to have the main event match-up in this entry. I can settle of a borderline 3 out of 10 with the story. \n\nSo what it comes down to is music. I tend not to deviate my music score much from the rest of the show. I tend not to value it that highly. The ending song is okay but I do have major issues with the performance from Tia in the OP. There was a real turn-off for me listening to this nasally running on voice she used in the song. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve skipped the OP every time since episode 2. So with that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have to give another 1 out of 10. \n\n I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never experienced something so off-putting in anime like Kakegurui and it is going to be a benchmark for me when it comes to off-putting themes. If anything is as off-putting as the egregious faces and gambling orgasms then it will be a contender for a 1 out of 10 on my rating scale. For Anilist I'll give the show a 10 out of 100. Because at least were not getting episodic themes. So the story will keep it at a base 1 out of 10. \n"}, {"id": 2520, "score": 20, "body": "Girlfriends, boyfriends, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure most of us have wanted one at some point, or already have one. For those of us who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have one, do not fret, Hajimete no Gal is here to indulge you into the experience of having a girlfriend or boyfriend, whether you want it or not. This will not be a painless experience however, so strap yourself in and prepare for the worst, and I mean it.\n\nImagine this: You are just an ordinary guy, and your classmates forced you to ask a hot girl in your class to date you. After she almost turns you down like the loser you are, she instead decides to accept becoming your girlfriend, but is it too good to be true? In most cases, yes, this would be too good to be true, however, in Hajimete no Gal we say \"screw the rules! \"and make the unlikely happen.\n\nWhile the premise may seem enticing at first, the show doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do much to expand on it, leaving you with an empty shell of nothingness for a majority of the show. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen at least a couple harem/ecchi anime before, then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll probably see the pattern Hajimete follows through its episodes. This doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that it has nothing going for it, because it does. Every episode centers on our main character experiencing something new for the first time, whether that is visiting his girlfriend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house, going to karaoke or even getting a job. Of course, you also have your obligatory beach episode that every harem/ecchi seems to have, but I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get into that too much, since I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind it.\n\nAnother problem is the pacing, it feels really rushed. One moment the characters are doing something random, and in the next scene something dramatic happens without leaving any time to digest what happened. This wouldn't be a problem if the show in question was all about the randomness like Nichijou, but when you add a random element to what seems to be a semi-serious show, at least for me it doesn't work at all.\n\nIf you thought you were going to get some nice uncensored scenes, then think again. I watched the uncensored version, but instead of being presented with uncensored material, they instead decided to censor a guy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boner through his pants, because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s totally the best way to make someone interested in your show. The censored version is even worse by the way, they censor stuff like the girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s panties for no reason, which is a big no-no for me especially when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an ecchi show.\n\nThe characters are for the most part dull and forgettable. The male characters except for the main character don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really serve a purpose except for being there, which of course entails in almost no character development whatsoever. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even a literal pedophile saying that he only wants to fuck little girls, and that 15 year olds are too old for him. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not much else to say about them other than that you can literally replace them with clones of Ichika from Infinite Stratos and the experience wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change that much.\nThe females are for the most part attractive, if you ignore their humongous almost Eiken-level boobs and the fact that their personalities are barely there. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve even seen a screenshot from the show, or even the cover, you should know what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m talking about. They feel unnaturally large, especially for high schoolers, since you are not supposed to have such big boobs when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re between 16 and 18 years old, but hey, what do I know, right? This is anime we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about, where the impossible can happen at any time because the creator allows for it.\n\nAs for the art, it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that bad, but it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand out either. There was never a moment where I went \u00e2\u0080\u009cwow, this is totally worth it for the art\u00e2\u0080\u009d instead it was kind of just meh. It serves a purpose, but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect anything fancy, since you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be disappointed.\n\nThe opening was decent enough, and I actually liked the ending theme, it was catchy and felt like a nice end to each episode. Other than that, the rest of the OST was pretty forgettable, mostly just common background music for the sake of having music.\n\nHajimete no Gal had some okay moments, but the sheer amount of pointless scenes, straight up useless characters and unnecessary censorship pushes my buttons just a little bit too far, and in the end it was a massive disappointment. What could have been an interesting and creative take on the genre instead becomes your run of the mill harem/ecchi show with too many dumb things to explain. If you can, stay away from this show, it is really bad.\n"}, {"id": 2521, "score": 10, "body": "There comes a time when something becomes so bad that not even the good aspects can salvage it, and this is certainly the case with Pupa. From repetitive events to scenes that almost made me vomit, Pupa does everything it can to make you hate it. If that was your intention Pupa, you certainly did a great job in doing so.\n\nIf I had to describe Pupa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cstory\u00e2\u0080\u009d (if you can even call it that) in two words, it would be \u00e2\u0080\u009cdreadful mess\u00e2\u0080\u009d. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basically just torture porn. Utsutsu, our main male character, tries to save his sister Yume from becoming a monster due to some virus, who then proceeds to eat him alive. After she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done with him, he revives, because he also has some sort of virus, and the episode is over. Next episode, rinse and repeat until episode 11. Episode 12 however is completely different, but it establishes nothing remotely interesting and leads me to believe that the creators just gave up and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, if people didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like episodes 1-11, then why not fuck with them and produce a useless ending that has nothing to do with the rest of the show?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cGreat idea man! *High five*\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe characters are as generic as you can get, the only thing I remember about them is that Utsutsu has a scar over his left eye. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it; they left no impact on me. Not even the black-haired woman (who I think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in a hentai by the way) made me care about her, she was just kind of there.\n\n\n\nI think the worst part about Pupa is the fact that they decided to censor out some of the bloody and violent parts, while keeping in others. For instance, in one scene a knife is censored out for some reason (don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know why), but then like a minute later Yume is in the middle of eating her brother and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not censored? What is that about? You decide to censor out a knife but not a guy being EATEN ALIVE? Come on, you can do better than that.\n\nContinuing from my last paragraph, even if the show wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t censored and we got to see all the blood and gore, the art and animation is so basic that it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even look decent. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d think that since the episodes are only 4 minutes long, they would have to spend less money per episode which would lead to better art and animation, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where you would be wrong. They instead decide to save as much money as possible by making low quality frames and character models.\n\nI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really enjoy something that portrays itself so badly and makes me want to stop watching it. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see how anyone would enjoy this, unless you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re into torture porn or vore I guess. But even then, there are better options out there that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make you want to rip your hair out at how infuriating it is. Not many shows have made me angry while watching them, but Pupa became one of them, and for that I salute you; You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve entered the pit of no return, the place where only the worst of the worst get permission to enter. You can never leave, and you will never hear from me again. Say goodbye Pupa, you will not be missed.\n\nTo summarize, Pupa is an awful mess that not only repeats itself every episode and has a horrible ending that ties nothing together, but also makes you angry at the fact that the creators actually made this irredeemable pile of junk. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t watch this, unless you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a complete masochist or into torture porn and vore.

Anyone who knows me will immediately tell you that when it comes to anime I'm the biggest fucking sap ever. It doesn't take me much to get invested in a romantic story, and even less so to get me to feel heavy emotional pangs and sympathize with the characters. More than one anime romance drama has left me in tears, but this show has me crying for completely different reasons.\n\nThis show started off fine. A dumb weak sci-fi premise where the future versions of all the characters send back letters so their earlier selves can avoid their regrets. Seems like a weak idea for a show if the characters never fuck up or create any drama, but whatever, I can roll with it. I'm a sucker for romance after all. There's this new kid in town, Kakeru, who is the express subject of nearly all of these letters. Turns out that he's sad as fuck because of some bad life stuff, and ends up offing himself because all of the core cast are just bad friends and didn't really support, or some shit like that. \n\nOf course, our special needs MC, Naho, likes this guy, but is too cripplingly disabled to say it, like all portrayals of high school girls in anime. Normally, this wouldn't be an issue, and we'd spend 13 episodes of high school bullshit getting them sort-of together and end on a half-assed, half kiss like every other shoujo ever, but now we have to save Kakeru's life. It's alright though, we'll just use the magic future letters to make sure we don't fuck up... UNTIL WE IMMEDIATELY START IGNORING THEM ON EPISODE. FUCKING. ONE. Naho is more dense than a fucking neutron star and decides to throw the magic letters that are ALWAYS RIGHT out the fucking window because she \"just can't handle it\". \n\nI get why she doesn't from a story perspective; this show would have no drama at all if they just followed their future selves' instructions, but that isn't good for us as an audience. If we know what the two possible outcomes are, we just don't care, because a show like this reads from the first episode that everything is going to be OK despite a couple bumps in the road. Orange just can't fucking decide if it wants to be some sort of \"we choose our own destiny\" bullshit or just a normal high school shoujo romance, and it suffers heavily because of it. \n\nFrom an aesthetic perspective, this show leaves everything to be desired. The shoujo fat-lipped art style is incredibly generic and the animation is the farthest thing from fluid I've seen in a long time. This isn't even counting the numerous 'QUALITY' moments that line the series middle section. The consistency takes a hard drop off a cliff at episode 3 (which is also where the anime jumps the shark from the manga, BTW), and doesn't even remotely pick up again until episode 10. Literally half drawn frames are there for you to see plain as day. Music is also incredibly generic. Everything about this show is generic. And bad.\n\nBurn this show in the dumpster fire it deserves to be left in. There are hundreds of mediocre anime romances and a handful of great ones that you could be watching instead. Avoid this like the plague.\n\n[__For more from this season and others, check out my blog!__](http://thebeanwolf.blogspot.com/2016/09/summer-2016-anime-in-review.html)"}, {"id": 2554, "score": 20, "body": "We're never going to get a worthy Beserk adaptation. This is something that fans of the manga have just come to accept after God knows how many years of waiting. The 90's anime really wasn't all that bad, but it was a slideshow even for time period, and the Golden Age films were an unsettling mix of decent hand drawn art and horrid CG, not to mention they just retold the same story that we've seen adapted twice now. The Golden Age arc is effectively a prequel to the rest of the Berserk franchise, so have twenty years where nothing but that was adapted is incredibly frustrating, especially with a series that has as strong and beautiful a piece of source material as Berserk does.\n\nBerserk (2016) takes the terrible CG from the Golden Age movies and makes it the main focus. There are smatterings of hand drawn art mixed in, but never enough to offset the CG and just enough to remind you what this new series could have been. We're finally pushing past the Golden Age arc into the core Berserk story, but the studio took a massive liberty with the source material and condensed about 400 panels into just five minutes of animation to accelerate the story to where Guts first encounters Farnes and her group of knights. This is the \"Black Swordsman\" arc, which serves to introduce us to the broken and desperate post-Eclipse Guts, and like I said above, is cut to about 5% of its original content. From this point, more large changes from the source come at a rapid pace. The entirety of the \"Lost Children\" arc, one of the most emotionally powerful arcs from the manga, is completely cut, with the story accelerating to Guts being captured at Farnes' camp. There is also an anime original (but Miura directed) episode that fills that gap between the camp and the beginning of the \"Conviction\" arc, that is decent and introduces us to just how damaged Farnes really is, but is still tragically low quality compared to the source.\n\nIt's at this little-less-than-halfway point that the adaptation really starts to step it up and make you mad at what you're given. The \"Conviction\" arc is more or less extremely well adapted, as in true to the source, in its entirety; it's just adapted into complete garbage. Aesthetically, Berserk (2016) is about as bottom of the barrel as it gets for the CG portions. CG movement is jerky and unnatural, models \"pop\" jarringly out of the average backgrounds, and the texturing is incredibly low-fidelity. They try to emulate Miura's hashing-based shading by slapping a half-assed version of the effect on top of the 3D models, and it does nothing but look incredibly stupid. The small amount of 2D, hand drawn art is actually decent but nowhere near the quality that Berserk deserves. The sound design is also particularly terrible, which is a shame because the VA and music are both actually pretty alright.\n\nEverything about Berserk (2016) is just a massive letdown, and is even moreso considering the studio seems to really wants to adapt the source into animation faithfully (outside the strangely accelerated start) but obviously does not have the budget or talent to do so. I'm not sure what has to be done for Berserk to get the high quality anime adaptation that it deserves, but I'm convinced that it must be fucking impossible.\n\nGo read the manga, don't waste your time with this.\n\n[__For more from this season and others, check out my blog!__](http://thebeanwolf.blogspot.com/2016/09/summer-2016-anime-in-review.html)"}, {"id": 2557, "score": 0, "body": "I like to think that I've sat through some terrible anime in my time.

It has zero merit as a piece of art, animated work, or general entertainment. I would have much rather gouged out my own eyes than watched this series, and given the choice I'd have reached for the nearest rusty spoon in an instant. This show has no idea where it's going, what it's doing, or what it wants to do. At first, I thought this show was going to this season's Bungou Stray Dogs, where the story is retarded but at least the character designs and fights were cool enough to keep me halfway interested, but the animation quality for Taboo Tattoo took a complete nosedive after episode 1, devolving into commonplace CG and slideshow-like animation from that point forward. I distinctly remember a scene where a walking character simply didn't have an animated walk cycle, and instead her drawing translated about the screen freely. The music and art are also incredibly generic and bad, especially for a studio like J.C.

Our MC is literally named \"Justice\", and has the best super power that is activated for free by the nature of him being the biggest, most tired trope. We have childhood-friend-big-tits McGee who is overused for the short half of the series that she is alive for the purposes of otaku pandering fanservice shots and light novel powertrip fantasies. We have Rin Tohsaka look-alike Antagonist Hime, who is incredibly gay and not much else. Like, no, she's actually a lesbian and the occasional yuribait jokes (of which there are maybe 4 or 5 total) are the only thing that even got me to look up from my phone.

Yeah, that might not have go so far as to show a kiss in the middle of a crowded sports stadium, but being bold doesn't really make a show good unless you judge every show you watch on a scale of Tumblr-acceptance levels. The story in all honesty was pretty typical for that of a sports anime, as were all the characters. Yuri is our typical protagonist, Yurio is the angry rival, etc etc..., none of these characters are anything new or novel. \n\nI will admit that this show came out of the gate firing aesthetically. The first episode looked like a movie, but to say the show couldn't keep this up was an understatement. Skate animation was incredibly good to start, but the show did the most heinous thing that anime can do starting about halfway through, and that's REUSING FRAMES. From episode six or so to the end, the ONLY new piece of skate animation for any of Yuri's routines was the quad flip in his last routine, with every other piece of animation being reused. I can appreciate the difficulty of animating figure skating, but I can NEVER forgive such blatant reuse of frames. There are tons of different angles that could have been explored to keep animation fresh, but it honestly felt like I was watching the same episode over and over again throughout the entire second half of the show. The music did almost nothing to add to the hype, with Yuri's track in particular having an incredible build up and then no substance after the drop, disappointing you rather than making his eventual victories feel like, well, victories. One thing I will praise though is the VA, with Yuri in particular having personality in bounds that I wish I heard more in that kind of character. The modesty/skill disparity that Yuri's character archetype holds comes off as genuine only because of his VA, and not much else.\n\nI get why this show was well received, but once the season passes and those touting the \"progressive\"-ness of it move on to the next thing, I think that it will be forgotten. In reality, it's just another Free!; a show that panders to a very niche market that just ended up luckily getting a good amount of exposure.\n\n[__For more from this season and others, check out my blog!__](http://thebeanwolf.blogspot.com/2017/01/fall-anime-in-review-2016.html)\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                "}, {"id": 2575, "score": 30, "body": "I've been baited by the damn semicolon.

I couldn't have been more wrong, and I'm 99.99% sure that it isn't even my fault. \n\nNow, although Child is definitely a sequel to Head, the new plot of Child more so builds off of the results of Head instead of continuing some sort of overarching narrative. The show sets itself up as some sort of supernatural murder mystery concerning psychic powers. Not a bad premise but certainly not something terribly original. Of course it's set in high school, and we've got probably the most stereotypical cast of visual novel characters of all time. I've already made it a habit of rattling off tropes so I'll spare you this time, but just know that there is nothing original or interesting about our characters here... at least not at first. As the incredibly convoluted and confusing story plods forward, a two or three of them start to become slightly more interesting with their own sorry excuses for motivations other than \"let's solve the mystery because MC likes mysteries\". \n\nAs the plot all comes vomiting out after about the first five or six episodes of doing next to nothing to advance it, it becomes terribly apparent just how poorly the adaptation was done. Chaos;Child is a pretty well liked and in-depth visual novel with ~50+ hours of gameplay, so a branching narrative is obviously one of its strong points. In adapting that, the directors chose to basically \"set up\" everything first, which lead to the 5 or 6  episodes of no advancement and the subsequent vomit. I don't understand why anime directors think they can get away with these \"condensed\" VN adaptations. We need look no further than the original Fate/Stay Night by DEEN to realize that this approach is never going to work well. \n\nIn Chaos;Child's case, this just makes the already pretty weak climax and \"twist\" we are presented with in the second half feel even more out-of-left-field and not genuine than they already would have if the director would have just stuck to adapting one VN route. This isn't even acknowledging the other ridiculous plot points, such as Nono being shanked in an alley and left for dead, surviving as if nothing had happened, and instead of being hospitalized just being laid down in her home, TREATED BY HER FRIENDS AS IF SHE HAD A COLD. The utter insanity of how some of these actions play out (and are flat-out glossed over by the characters) is frankly unforgivable.\n\nGo read a synopsis, and if it sounds even remotely interesting to you, just go out and play the VN. There's honestly nothing to enjoy here in the adaptation outside of possibly the first episode and some incredibly generic art, character designs, and music.\n\n[__For more from this season and others, check out my blog!__](http://thebeanwolf.blogspot.com/2017/03/winter-2017-anime-season-in-review.html)\n\n                                                                                                                                                         "}, {"id": 2576, "score": 10, "body": "This show is beyond terrible.

Fuuka is one of the latter, and dear merciful Christ is it absurd. Fuuka is a story about love, music, and fucking both of those things up so hard that they don't even look like the same things on the other end. All of your favorite characters from all of fiction are present, like, MAIN CHARACTER and BLUE-HAIRED HEROINE. In a surprising turn of events, they end up going to a concert or some shit together after meeting on the roof (original idea do not steal), where they walk around a statue looking for each (on opposite sides) for FIVE. WHOLE. MINUTES. Because of this life changing experience of statue searching, blue-haired Fuuka decides she loves MC, who's name I couldn't care to remember if you threatened my life, and that she OWNS him and MUST have his love. Of course instead of telling him this, she acts all pouty and sad for 12 episodes instead.\n\nFuuka leads everyone on by coming up with this stupid idea to start a band and play cover songs, to which everyone agrees is an amazing idea for no reason. Fuuka can sing because plot convenience, and MC decides that he'll learn to play bass because he's cursed with crippling beta-itis. They then gather your typical group of magically musically competant high-schoolers, such as SPORTS McDRUMMERGUY, RICHY PIANO-PANTS, and CEVANT GUITAR-GIRL. Guitar-Girl is seemingly a mute until she notices that she talks to MC on Twitter. This unbreakable bond that could stretch across universes and destroy galaxies cures her of her mute and stoic attitude, and this facet of her character is never explored again. Because of Twitter.\n\nEveryone's rose-colored dreams of starting a band a destroyed by MC's celebrity childhood friend, SHIRAYUKI'S VA. She's hopelessly in love with MC and became a successful solo artist by only writing songs about she loves MC for no reason other than being the doomed-to-lose childhood friend trope. This creates all sorts of wacky situations for the band, like going to the beach and being mad for no reason, getting stoned to death on stage because of a misunderstanding, and generally having severe bouts of anime-romance induced autism. Oh, and at the end of it all Fuuka runs away from everything to become a solo artist because it's impossible for the heroine to be forward with her feelings despite being an incredibly forward personality in all other facets of their character so we'll have two more episodes I guess.\n\nIn an incredibly ballsy move, the show actually puts SHIRAYUKI'S VA and MC in a relationship, which is satisfying for all of 3 minutes until you realize that even SHIRAYUKI'S VA is just a hollow husk of nothingness that you've projected the motivations and charm of another character on for no reason other than that they had the same voice actress. MC then continues to sulk about how his beautiful celebrity girlfriend, reasonably successful band, and overall perfect highschool existence just isn't fucking good enough for him. He ends up dumping celebrity girlfriend because he realizes that he loves Fuuka because of plot convenience and no real character motivations other than that \"it was episode 12 and we needed a climax\".\n\nI wrote this before the last episode aired and I don't give a flying fuck how it ended. Fuuka is everything wrong with anime romance drama rolled up and decorated with a nice little bow. They should show this shit to directors as an example of what to NEVER DO. The entire experience feels like if someone really not-talented watched White Album 2 and said \"Hey man I can do that I think\". Thankfully they had someone with real talent draw a couple of the character designs because even though they're generic as all fuck at least they are sort of pretty to look at as the rest of the plot burns down in a blazing fire of autism.\n\nLeave this show in the dumpster fire it belongs in."}, {"id": 2585, "score": 5, "body": "This show came out of the gate over-edgy and terrible, with lines like, \"The pain is the only thing that makes me feel alive,\" but I knew it going in.

Do not watch this. Just save yourself the pain and don't. Writing, story, characters, plot, animation, sound, every single part of this anime is mediocre to average, barely scraping an acceptable pass or failing entirely due to its sheer lack of trying.\n\nPretty much all that happens in the story is this, but three times: Some random terrorist organization with no clear or sensible motive that is set up as bad because they want to shoot people or whatever makes a stupid move to piss off the main character. Main character strolls in and kills or captures everyone without any difficulties because he is a god, end plot arc. Riveting stuff, truly. Not even kidding, this same plot happens *three times*, with very minor variations in scenario. And yet, the presentation of this story somehow still manages to be janky and weird even with how basic it is. I often found myself confused as to why I was even being shown something. Many scenes could simply be removed and nothing would change, due to being completely pointless or introduced in such a confusing way or way too early so that you forget about them by the time they are relevant. If the story wasn't already lacking anything compelling, the writing is something a tenth grader could write, causing actions that are meant to make me care more about the story or characters to fall completely flat.\n\nWell, what if you want to watch for the characters? It's simple really, don't. Almost all of the characters, dare I say maybe even every single one, are forgettable and bland basic characters that have been boiled down to one or two simple personality traits, along with no character development throughout the entire runtime. None of the characters changed from episode one to the last episode in any meaningful way, they're all exactly the same. This is partly due to trying to handle too many characters, many got barely any screen time to the point where you almost forget they exist. The main character is the worst of them all, the writers were clearly trying *so god damn hard* to make him the most badass character ever, giving him way too many abilities, taking away his emotions so he seems cooler, and writing in a bunch of cheesy lines.\n\nInterested in the lore and universe? Don't watch for that either. The backstory makes barely any sense when scrutinized, as no explanation is given for any of the presented history and it doesn't hold up much to common sense. The world is pretty much just modern day, even though it's eighty years in the future with magicians, plenty of what is shown could be made today or *is* made today, this problem being especially prevalent in the beginning of the anime. But don't even get me started on the magic system itself. Every time they introduce a new spell or element they try and explain how it works, great right? Except every single explanation in this godforsaken anime is a bunch of technobabble nonsense using made up words that are never clearly defined. It took me approximately fifteen episodes to even have an elementary grasp of the simplest and most vital of the terms they use to explain every other phenomenon. Even then it's only a rudimentary understanding that still leaves you with no actual comprehension if you stop for even two seconds to try and figure out how any of this magic actually works. This is a huge over-arching theme with the explanations in Irregular at Magic, is that every single one is missing some huge key point that fits it all together, but without this piece, it all is just nonsense babbling filling the time slot. This is never fixed in any of the twenty-six episodes.\n\nAnother huge problem is how there is never any tension in the plot, as every situation is dealt with by some new ability of the main character that we haven't seen until now. And every time it happens, every other character is shocked because it is some top secret military tech or some new tech created by the main character. They then give one of those infamous technobabble explanations that don't really help you understand anything at all then move on. What makes the lack of tension or stakes even worse is that the enemies they face are almost all idiots, especially in the first half of the anime. Anyone who is not on the side of the main cast instantly loses about fifty IQ points. As well as that, anything that is thrown at the main cast is handled with extreme ease. Guns, mechs, tanks, bombs, everything is dealt with as if it was a marble thrown by a toddler. What is even worse is that by the ending episodes it has devolved to the point where even if a character were to die it isn't a big deal because we can literally just regenerate them instantly. Where are the stakes at that point? The most egregious part, and I cannot stress this enough, is how over-powered the main character is. He has so much power he is on the level of a god. I cannot comprehend a situation in which he would ever be defeated, apart from possibly, maybe being sabotaged, somehow. What do you even do when your character is so powerful that there is not a single scenario I can foresee where he would ever be defeated? There are simply no stakes at all by the time you know the full extent of his powers. Even before he starts using the full extent, he can still bring down almost anyone he wishes while barely trying.\n\nOn top of all the other terrible factors, the animation is simple and basic, the absolute minimum that is acceptable to look at all decent. It only barely scrapes by as looking okay, with the barest of movements for characters to look alive, even at the peak moments of the story. They also made the terrible decision to employ 3D CG throughout some of the more difficult scenes, and while I can handle a little use of 3D in the right places, they go overboard here. There is some truly terrible CG, but the true sin is how they went and used it for a major portion of the final few episodes, making what I assume are meant to be formidable mechs and interesting fight scenes look laughable.\n\nAudio work is also barely passable. The opening is extremely average and nothing new or special at all, and the background music often just sounds like a bunch of crap being mashed together. Need it to sound techy? Add in a bunch of annoying computer-sounding bleeps. Sports event? Add in some whistles or something who cares even at this point. There was never once a piece of music or sound work that actually stood out at all. It was all just passing.\n\nThe entirety of Irregular at Magic Highschool is the definition of aiming for a passing grade and not going any further. If you stripped the entire anime down to the most bare-bones form, then fleshed it out with good content, it would be fine. But that isn't saying much as, instead, we are dealing with this trash heap. Everything combines to create a boring, generic, brainless piece of nonsense. There is not a single thing I can find to praise.

I wanted to know why this series was so infamous, especially when the synopsis sounded interesting. I wanted to know what all the fuss was about.\nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know why I found this anime entertaining \u00e2\u0080\u0093 maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take it seriously from the get go and so just enjoyed it as a mindless despair/gorefest. Similar to how people \u00e2\u0080\u0098enjoy\u00e2\u0080\u0099 something like Higurashi or Another. \n\nThe characters were so-so, some of them could have done with more development but when they were developed they were done so decently enough. The art was fine most of the time, although there were points where the animation quality dropped greatly. Music was good. And as for the seiyuus \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I think they were great. They actually managed to sound like they were in pain when they were meant to be in pain (at least the majority of them did). There was some fanservice, but not nearly as bad as I expected based on a couple of the reviews I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d read. Apart from the very first scene and another scene about halfway through the series, there was really nothing worth mentioning. And even those scenes weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that terrible.\n\nThe torture was another story. Like I said, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a gorefest. Worse than Elfen Lied or Akame ga Kill!, but not by much. Besides most of the scenes were done in such a ridiculous way it was hard to take them seriously. \n\nLet me be clear, the only (or at least the main) reason that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m giving it a bad score (in my rating system, anything under 60 is bad) is because the plot holes were so gaping huge they were impossible to ignore. This was objectively a terrible anime in terms of plot \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it literally makes no sense if you think about it for more than a second or two. I literally had no idea what was going on at the end. But I still found it okay on the whole.\n\nIt was actually very thought-provoking, in a way \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it made me wonder what I would do if I was in a similar position. One where I was completely at the mercy of a situation I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand, having no idea what would happen next except that it would be inescapable, and painful no matter the outcome. Not to mention that the longer I survived, the more despairing I would be when I inevitably came to die. \nI ended up thinking the characters behaved quite realistically. I mean, in their situation, there were really only 3 choices:\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tSuffer a total mental breakdown and either commit suicide or lose all sense of reality. Maybe try to take everyone else with you for good measure.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tTry to keep yourself from going over the brink by desperately clinging onto some form of hope - reassuring everyone else helps too. \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tCompletely lock off your emotions and become a robot \u00e2\u0080\u0093 regard the entire situation dispassionately and logically try to find a way out. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter if no one but you survives.\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m actually not sure which one of these I would be\u00e2\u0080\u00a6interesting to think about, if a little gloomy.\n\nSo, those are my impressions. The abysmal plotline prevented me from giving it anything higher than a 50/100, but there were interesting parts, and, overall, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t dislike it. So, if you like gore, a big cast of characters, and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind a terrible storyline, you can try giving it a go. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to tell what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like after the first 3 episodes anyway; it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t progress much.\n\n"}, {"id": 2624, "score": 10, "body": "I hate everything about this show.

With a 12-episode, four-minute short series that only follows the story (horribly) for the first 11 episodes. The final episode is the bonus chapter from the end of volume two. Before beginning proper, I have to say that the story is the main issue I have with this adaptation and I enjoyed the manga quite a bit. Also, I'll be using spoilers (marked [#]) to hide what's in the manga, and not what's in the anime. I don't care about spoiling this, as the total runtime is ~37 minutes and I don't recommend watching it. I'm using old notes and I haven't seen(/read) this in a while, so just a heads up the story section might have some mistakes.\n\n# Story: 0\nThe plot revolves around Utsutsu and Yume Hasegawa, siblings. They're both infected with a disease that causes the sister to transform into a grotesque monster, and the brother to immediately heal from injuries. The first time Yume fully transforms, she ends up attacking and eating people, and Utsutsu tries to calm her, despite a warning from researcher Maria. She ends up eating him, and he regenerates afterward. [1]\n\nEpisodes three through five don't make any sense.\nEpisode five is where there's an attempt at explaining how long Yume has been as she is. Their mother is shown as unable to even start to talk about an abortion (she didn't want to have the baby of a monster. A different kind of monster) and later on, attempts to kill Yume (who is shown to have teeth and more intelligence than a baby should, from birth). She laughed and regenerated. Of course, Utsutsu is the older brother and doesn't get why this is happening, so he protects her. The mother is later institutionalized. [2]\n\nEpisode six is four minutes of Yume eating Utsutsu as he continuously heals from it. On a bed, with lots of moaning. When I say this show wastes its own time, this is what I mean. This scene was irrelevant and creepy in the manga and making an entire episode of it makes it even worse.\n\nEpisodes eight through ten are when the corners start getting cut. There are multiple points that should be animated but aren't shown, and it skips around an entire volume to stay in one location.\n\nEpisode 12 is a side-story and flashback that was the bonus chapter of the final volume. Given that this adaptation barely reached the end of volume two, this was incredibly unnecessary and it shows that the staff had no idea how to handle this material.\n\nI spent far longer talking about episodes than I planned to, so I'll try to be brief from here on.\nThe story is butchered. If nothing I said there made sense, I'm sorry. It can't be much worse than the series itself.\n\n# Sound: 4\nI like the opening, the voice acting is okay, ending isn't memorable. Sound effects are pretty bad though.\n\n# Art/Animation: 2\nThe art style closely follows the manga, but leaves the design decisions unexplained. [3] Episodes with any sort of action tend to cut corners and use many still images or hide sections that would require more animation.\n\n# Characters: 5\nI actually like the characters here, but I am trying to fight bias from the manga here. Enough of the characters have had depth removed for me to lower the score, such as Yume and Utsutsu's parents. Their mother wasn't actually mentally ill and their father was much more demented. Utsutsu himself was far more violent than this series let on, though there was a point in episode eight that stated it. I think Maria was the character that lost the most depth here, with most of her fleshing out happening later in the story.\n\n~!1: Yume isn't human. It isn't a disease, for her anyway. The anime DOES show this, but without proper context, making the mother appear to be mentally ill. Changes in the first two episodes, other than omitting the father's introduction, aren't too bad.\n\n2: Later in the manga, we learn that she did have consciousness during this time due to being completely alive before taking the form of a fetus. She later protected Utsutsu after an accident he would've died in, and then hid her memories. Oh yeah, the father knew the mother wasn't crazy the entire time and didn't come around to being a \"good guy\" until volume three.\n\n3: The manga leaves the character designs for later on as well, it takes a long time to find out why Utsutsu has so many scars.!~"}, {"id": 2666, "score": 48, "body": "As a manga reader, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s many things that must be addressed. For one, since it was 12 episodes long, I knew it would end in the shittiest arc possible. I hated it in the manga, I hate it here as well. Second, the adaptation was close to perfect, unfortunately the presentation of certain scenes were overly expressed more than it needed to be. With the 90% Rape and the 10% Consent, I felt a need, a need to think about this again.\n\nLet me get this straight, as of right now, I enjoy the manga. The latest chapters started spicing things up. However, since the anime adapted such a crappy arc in the first place, there comes no surprise to when I say that I hated the second half of the anime.\n\nCitrus is a Yuri manga that decided to show up after a long time since its announcement. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of those series where you say \u00e2\u0080\u009cfuck it, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s yuri.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \n\nWhen I first made my review, I gave it an 8, simply for the fact that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m biased towards yuri and am basically obligated to watch it for such a reason. But knowing the fact that it goes downhill once the second half begins, just enjoying it for the \u00e2\u0080\u009cyuri\u00e2\u0080\u009d doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t become something I say often.\n\nThe first half is what you call exceptional, a girl goes to an all-girls school where her mom remarries and her step sister turns out to be someone of important. Thus the encounter captivates her and gives her the green-light to pursue such a love. But can such a love succeed when all Mei can do is use her hands for anything but love. I understand her situation, I get that her only way of communication can be through sexual acts, but when this continues for a long time with little to no change throughout the series, it makes it harder to take her seriously each time.\n\nI appreciate the mature-ish tone that the anime decided to take, but each time they try to make it \u00e2\u0080\u009cimpactful,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the actual effect decreases each time they attempt this. I also disliked the fact that they try to drag out the story but putting *ahem* \u00e2\u0080\u009cantagonists.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The first time Matsuri showed up, I was pissed, but thankfully later on she redeemed herself a little bit and became more tolerable. Now when Nana and Sara showed up, oh boy I was attempted to drop the manga there and then. Even though Sara and Nana didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stay within the main focus for too long, I just disliked the fact that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re practically insert characters to prolong the conflict as long as possible.\n\nBut of course, not everything about Citrus is bad. The art for the anime looks just about the same as Uta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drawings, which I do appreciate. The voice acting was superb, each seiyuu fulfilled the role perfectly and captured the feelings no matter the circumstance or situation. The music and opening song were fantastic since I appreciate the stuff nano.RIPE makes. The animation was fine but the CGI near the start of the series was really off-putting. Thankfully, this occurs less as it goes on. Those were really my two cents of the series. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hate everything about it, but boy did it get annoying to watch later on.\n\nCitrus as an adaptation did well. It followed the panels and it showed almost every detail. Unfortunately they extended scenes that were not needed. Even if it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t drive off from the original source, there are things that must not be added. It was quite a shame that it ended off at one of the worst arcs possible, however if you do have the time to read past where the anime ended, then I suggest you would. The manga does get somewhat better, but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect it to be amazing. I am enjoying it thus far now. I do have one pet peeve however, I hated, and I mean hated the way they adapted chapter 8\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kiss scene (out of love). That kiss was one of the best in the manga, and it looked awkward and weird on the anime. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just me being picky though.\n\nCitrus succeeded in terms of adaptation, but failed in all other aspects. Although it falls flat, I must say that Saburo Uta did one thing right\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\n\nMaking Harumin one of the hottest characters in existence.\nimg220(https://yurination.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/casual-harumin.jpg?w=640)"}, {"id": 2676, "score": 40, "body": "It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s naughty, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s raunchy, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s punchline-heavy..._Seitokai Yakuindomo_ is back, and now on the big screen.\n\nOne thing someone has to get used to when reading or watching a gag series is that you can and shall never expect any sort of character progress.

In fact, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safer to think of it as an extension of the Season 2 OVAs, as each segment is even titled according to the episode number order of the series. As such, gags are presented just like the show, which makes this a 2-episode special more than anything.\n\nYou could have qualms or complaints on how the movie is still in its episodic format, but the truth is it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not really as relevant to properly addressing the one criticism the film lacks over its predecessors.\n\nCharacters, as mentioned, are driving forces of a gag-filled comedy like _SYD_. Without the diversity of its characters, it can get old pretty quick, and this is exactly what happens through the rest of the film. Screen times for the supporting characters beyond the student council breath new life into the past two seasons, and lessening their involvement in this film hampers the impact of what would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been a harmless fun time. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not enough Dejima, Uomi, Hata\u00e2\u0080\u0094all of these prominent characters lack enough involvement in the film, effectively limiting the variety of the film.\n\nWhile on technical standpoints both animation and sound get nice upgrades, to the point that there is a fourth-wall break about the nice surround sound the film has over the TV series, and the creativeness of visual comedy the film takes to assert its bigger budget, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sadly nothing to write home about, and even more does it lack the ability to boost enjoyment over the film\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inferior one-sided humor.\n\nPersonally, even though I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t consider _SYD Movie_ as the worst experience I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had with the franchise, I also feel that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the weakest entry it has ever had.

It's not going to amaze you in any singular aspect, in fact the anime sort of just felt like a love letter to independent music venues, that unfortunately are slowly dying out. \nI was however pleasantly surprised there was depths to the anime beyond the show just being another cookie cutter 'Cute Girls Doing Cute Things' series, such as character motivations beyond just the surface level - people are complicated, and by extension so are bands, so it's good it captured some of that reality.\nIn the end though, a music anime relies on the actual quality of the music to be successful and this show has no spectacular songs at all to be totally honest. They're passable for the context of the show, but I'm not tempted to go back and listen to them again. It's funny how the characters don't even consider getting a drummer until the opportunity literally falls onto their laps though. Also, the show liked to focus on the girls posteriors quite frequently which was sort of strange for an otherwise completely clean show, but hey that's Japan I guess. \nBut my biggest gripe with the show is the way everyone is a bit too... nice. It's as though there's no spiteful bands, no arrogance or anything of the sort. From my own experience there's plenty of arrogance surrounding bands, especially when you're sharing the stage with another band. Also, when the band plays it doesn't sound live, especially the vocals.\nIf you haven't seen either 'K-On!' or 'Beck', watch those before hand because they are infinitely better. This show is ultimately trying to capture the atmosphere of 'K-On!' but handles it haphazardly when compared to a masterpiece like 'K-On!', which actually gives the band a measure of authenticity in the way they improve as a band, and the way the sound design matches that of a live concert when they play in their school hall, or sounds like they're playing in a smaller room when they're playing in their club room. Both the main character in 'BanG Dream!' and 'K-On' share a similar childish demeanour, both have little sisters, both play guitar and sing.

Considering the clear effort to make this movie a poignant fantasy about a struggling family, it can safely be said that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not trying to be either of those things. \n\n#Review in full:\n\nI'll start by saying that this isn't going to be the sort of review that's trying to scorn the movie or \"expose\" it as being terrible or whatever. Rather it will be an analysis of my own experiences with it, why I had them, what I thought about them, and if you're likely to have similar experiences with it or not.\n\nMy first viewing of this movie was in a group. As the movie started, me & my friends came to expect something charming yet emotionally serious in large part due to how much the early scenes suggested this. Indeed, the entire movie has a rather calm atmosphere about it (even during more dramatic moments) thanks to the tranquil art style and soundtrack.\n\n~~~img500(http://i.imgur.com/5JcKXEX.gif)\n_Mamoru Hosada sure makes his movies picturesque._~~~\n\nHowever, there is a certain event early on that will likely make or break the movie for you depending on how you look at it. I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spoil it here because I believe witnessing it spoiler-free is an integral part of the intended viewing experience, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suffice to say that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the first key event in the plot; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what allows the rest of the movie to happen at all. If you don't think about it too much you'll likely see it as an unusual yet romantic scene, but if you apply what you've been told so far about werewolves and how they work in this story then it can easily lead to a number of major questions as to how and why it's happening like this.\n\nAs the movie goes to the next few scenes, it takes on more of a \"slice of life\" approach to things, only with time-skips that can jump over a year or more of time. If you've been taken into the movie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aura of calmness it will flow along smoothly, but if you've already begun asking questions (as my friends and I had been) then two things will become apparent: the answers the movie suggests don't line up with what's actually been said and the \"slices\" of life are more like rough chunks considering the time-skips. In essence, a visible split between the story and its presentation appears.\n\nAt this point the entire group I was in had lost our suspension of disbelief, thanks to our questions and the unfitting answers we found. For a short while the movie's calmness began making people dose as they lost interest, until we started joking at the events & dialogue to follow. We weren't watching Wolf Children anymore, rather it had become Wolf Children Impromptu Abridgment. I had to re-watch the movie later to analyze it seriously, but the damage had been done.\n\nThe movie would continue it's slow yet jumpy \"chunks of life\" approach for much of its remainder, and while the idea was interesting, the execution never brought said idea to its fruition in either of my viewing experiences. Aside from Hana & Yuki (who were flawed, but in an appreciable & human way) the characters didn't receive much development, and some of their reactions to important events were jarring in the sense that they weren't very realistic reactions for the characters involved. The movie doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t attempt to explain why a werewolf would decide that the downtown of a major Japanese city is an acceptable hunting ground, or why a child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claim that they were attacked by a wolf inside a school (what with wolves being extinct in Japan) wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t raise serious questions. Doing so would only point out how poorly thought-out these events are.

In a story focusing on people growing up and deciding how they feel about the world and their place in it, the plot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emphasis was not put on the characters but rather the events they found themselves in. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a word for this type of plot; melodrama, and while I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d argue that melodrama is simply a tool that has a distinct purpose in storytelling, Wolf Children is a stark example of its overabundance and misuse in the modern day. The beauty of the visuals and the fitting & tranquil music tie into this, and are easy to get lost in, but if you think about it for more than a few moments while it's all happening then the detachment between story and presentation becomes clear, leaving you with something pretty yet bland.\n\n#Verdict:\n\nIf you are the sort of person who can shut off your brain, then this movie will take you away to a whimsical place. If you can't (or refuse to) stop thinking, then you may see this place for the well-painted box it really is, and your questions won't reveal all that much outside of it. As the latter, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say I enjoyed Wolf Children at all, despite the obvious effort made by its producers to be more than a simple box. If you're the former, then you may find much more enjoyment in this piece, but true substance will remain absent."}, {"id": 2693, "score": 25, "body": "Psychic School Wars is the answer to the question of what would happen if the writer of Steins;Gate suddenly had a stroke which left him mentally retarded. That the premise is dumb is self-evident by the thoroughly unimaginative title. That is not to say that the title actually tells you what will happen. The closest thing to a war in this movie is if it should take itself seriously or linger even longer on butt-shots and boob-glances.\n\nThe conflict in the movie, if we can call it that, is between the super-cliched transfer student Ryouichi and the equally cliche bumbling village idiot Kenji, or Ken for short. Ken is as thick as wood, and about as filled with personality as a black hole. Of course he also has a neighbour, Natsuki, who is both talented, physically strong, and helplessly in love with Ken. And Ken, the bumbling idiot that he is, has no clue. Ken is in love with boob-chan, or Kahori as she is also called. Kahori has a gentle spirit, likes playing the piano, is not at all interested in Ken, and obviously falls madly in love with our handsome mysterious Ryouichi at first glance - cause it was decided that there weren't enough cliches in this movie already - while she pays no heed to poor idiot Ken.\n\nOf course the mysterious transfer student has a glassy thing, a not so subtle hourglass which shimmers. And a white fox companion which speaks like an old dude and looks like a Pokemon.  He uses the glassy shiny thing to set things in motion, and the only one who can stand against him is Ken-kun the bumbling village idiot! The problem is that while the storyline is both incredibly simple and could make for some effective and interesting conflicts, the movie entirely forsakes these conflicts for romantic drama. This is not a war, but simply some slapped on time-traveling, psychic mumbo-jumbo with some pseudo-intellectual philosophical garbage being uttered so that it looks cool. It's as if a teenager wrote the script to try and impress other teenagers.\n\nIt's an adaption, and to everyone's surprise the writer is actually an old dude! I don't think we should blame the poor fellow too much though, the movie stands on its own and fails on its own. Having not read the source material that this movie is based on, I am willing to give that poor old dude reasonable doubt. The story is bewildering, meandering, and pointless. I sat there waiting for something to happen, yet nothing really ever did. It had some poor attempts at trying to show bullying which just seemed like a mockery of bullying everywhere. Everything that could have been given weight, including the relationships which form the main focus of the story, are instead drained of life by shitty anime Dracula. Oh and they want you to sit through the credits, all of them - yes all of them - before they end the movie. It's as if they looked at Marvel movies and said\n\n-You know what would be even more awesome than a small end credit scene? THE WHOLE ENDING END CREDIT-SCENE. We are geniuses, what could possibly go wrong.\n\nThe one redeeming feature of this movie lies in the artwork, which although uneven, does present us with some beautiful scenery. This movie is not really worth your time, but if you do watch it, leave your brain at the door. Even then, there is no action, no war, no nothing. This movie is as pointless as this review."}, {"id": 2700, "score": 30, "body": "2009\n\nThe endless eight arc is unforgivable. There's already a lot of issues with this series that stem from the unfortunate lack of anything ever mattering, but this awful arc takes that to a level that would almost be hilarious if it wasn't so sad. While I can appreciate the fact that the art and directing was slightly different in all eight of the episodes, it isn't nearly enough to fix the greater issues that stem from it.\n\nIn truth, it's insulting to the viewers to produce the same story for eight consecutive weeks. If the direction they were trying to go was so incredibly important to the story that they couldn't step away from repeating the same events in at least a few episodes, then the director should have limited it to a total of three. 1) The club goes through the events of the endless summer vacation, 2) The club figures out what is happening, 3) Kon saves the day. This would have had nearly the same impact, without taking an already mediocre high school romcom and making it totally unbearable.\n\nWith that short rant out of the way, I'll delve into a few other issues I had with the series as a whole. Most stories tend to either be character or plot driven (occasionally there is something truly magnificent that is both but it's rare, and certainly not the case here). The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya tends to forgo plot and instead tries to drive a fun story with it's \"strong\" characters. The issue with this isn't the direction, but instead the execution. It's problematic for a character-driven story to have terrible characters, and unfortunately, 4/5 of the mainstays in the series are genuinely bad. \n\nKon is the only character in the series that is at all enjoyable and even he struggles to maintain a grasp on the viewer's interest after the endless eight arc. Haruhi is better written than the other three main characters but despite that, she's not at all likable. She's both a Mary Stu and a generic Tsundere. Her relationship with Kon is occasionally cute, but I found myself desperately wishing that he wouldn't fall for her because he didn't deserve a life that would be filled with misery, and frankly, that's the only thing Suzumiya was going to offer him. The other three main characters are incredibly 1-d, it's really unfortunate that this is the case because all three of them have the potential to be much better characters than they actually are.\n\nThe thing that continues to stick out in my mind as I type this, is the wasted potential of the series. There was so much to work with and instead of actually adding flesh to the skeleton they built, they decided to go the sitcom route, and that only works if you're willing to write truly great characters.\n\nI walked into The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya expecting something lighthearted, funny, and potentially one of the all-time greats. What I got was a 26 episode high school romcom with bad characters and an episode that repeats itself 8 times.\n\n3/10 do not recommend unless you've seen thousands of other series and literally have nothing else to see."}, {"id": 2706, "score": 43, "body": "Everyone seems to have to watch Evangelion at some point, if for nothing else, so that they can wax philosophical about it. \n\nI avoided Evangelion for a long time as I had heard that the director had a lot of mental issues he was dealing with at the time, as well as the anime running out of budget near the end and having a somewhat \"interesting\" resolution. I was concerned that it was going to end up as too much of a mess to end up making any sense, but after viewing TTGL and a few other Gainax studio mech shows, I figured I should take finally take a look.\n\nWell, I finally ended up getting around to watching the series, and I have to say that I'm left at a bit of a loss as to how to properly evaluate it, especially considering my personal reaction was to be turned off by just about everything about it, but also wanting to try to be fair towards what (I think) the show was trying to do.\n\nWith regards to the technicals of the anime: \n\nThe art is a bit dated, but is actually pretty good for the time. Many of the mechas and angels are unique and interesting to look at. There are issues as the series goes on with reusing things quite a bit, but for the most part, the art is fine. \n\nThe sound and voice acting are pretty good. For the material that they were working with, my opinion is that the voice actors did an admirable job. The theme is a classic, and most of the soundtrack choices are nice as well.\n\nAs the technicals are done fairly well, it's a shame what actually ended up being presented as a story through the characters just didn't work that well given the issues I mentioned earlier.\n\nMecha is a tough genre to evaluate at times as it has such a storied history from Gundam on forward.  Liking one series doesn't even necessarily mean that you'll enjoy a different season or sequel either.  Evangelion is interesting in that it is at its heart, a deconstruction of sorts of the mecha that came before it.  A bit more of a surreal version of kids at war stories and what may psychologically be happening.  Even shows such as original Gundam deal with this somewhat, but Evangelion takes this theme of apocalypse and the kids fighting against it to interesting places and ultimately has you wondering a bit about what exactly is happening here as the internal and external worlds seem to be falling apart as the story progresses.  \n\nThere are occasions where art through adversity and stories told through depression make for some interesting looks into the darker side of character development. The problem is that as opposed to creating compelling story material, Evangelion relies heavily on shock factor, faux religious imagery (as the author himself has stated), and self indulgent trips into pointless downward spirals of self pity.\n\nI think that different people are going to get different things out of Evangelion, but as someone who doesn't, and never has for that matter, had to cope with depressive episodes, I don't think that Evangelion was actually written for someone like me.   \n\nThe major characters Shinji, and Asuka have a host of personal issues and angst that is related to the story, and unfortunately they are surrounded by people and situations that do nothing but enable downward spirals of negative character development for the most part. I was left wondering where the psychiatrists and emotional counselors were hanging out, because it seems like everyone trying to save the world had no business doing so. \n\nGenerally speaking, you need something in your heroes to root for, and while heroes are allowed to be flawed, at some point, you expect them to put aside their personal issues for the good of others. Generally speaking, outside of a few acts, this is a show where the heroes never get out of their own selfish, narcissistic, woe is me silliness and things continue to spiral because of it. Having the director going through mental issues during the production no doubt had a lot of influence in this, and it felt quite a bit like watching someone railing at the world at times more than a coherent narrative that actually had some sort of meaningful resolution.\n\nMy biggest problem with the main characters was that I kept waiting for the payoff, where the heroes would ultimately step up and become something to aspire to, or at least have someone mature drop the hammer on them, and I was left with a character study of what might happen if you were to throw psychologically damaged and unstable people together and tasked them with \"saving the world\". It's a pretty frustrating experience from that standpoint.  Of course, this may have ultimately been the point as well.  \n\nI can't say that Evangelion is completely without merit though. As a case study in mental issues and depressive cases, it will likely resonate with people who have suffered or currently suffer from depression or some type of angst. There is a layer of tragedy to the interactions between these broken individuals that could potentially be related to. As I mentioned earlier, as someone without these particular issues, I found it really difficult to get through the series and relate to the characters. I kept hoping for meaningful resolution and growth that never quite got there in the end.  It isn't fun nor is it cathartic (at least for me personally) to watch characters spiral into the depths of despair and self pity and not find some growth to overcome obstacles. \n\nThese problems ended up making Evangelion a slog to get through. As the budget ran out and the story took the tone shift into these downward spirals of character development, I was relying on inertia to get me through the final few episodes. Much has been written on the ending to Evangelion, and my general feeling is that I was disappointed with it. Budget issues or not, rehashing the characters problems and trying to add some kind of deeper meaning to the narcissistic self-pity was taxing and in the end, it felt at best a cop out, and at worst a middle finger to everyone who hung around. \n\nMuch has also been written about the supposed religious symbolism that the show used as well, but I tend to side with the folks who believe that it really doesn't mean much unless you are trying to insert your own meaning. I tend to view the religious symbolism in much the same way that I view the Galactic Empire in Legend of Galactic Heroes vaguely Nordic religiousness. It was tossed in there to add a bit of flavor, but not much else. There isn't anything wrong with inserting a personal meaning, as this show leaves you with a lot of questions if you look for them, but personal interpretations are just that, personal. \n\nAt the end of the day, I understand why the show is discussed as much as it is, but I'm also disappointed that it's discussed as much as it is as I can definitely see a path towards what happened to more modern anime because of this show.  I wanted to enjoy the series, but it felt far too self-indulgent and pretentious and ultimately didn't end up moving me like I thought it might.  I was pretty disappointed in that as the actual conflict with the mechas and the behind the scenes political intrigue gives this show the tools to be great, yet the overall themes I mentioned clumsily derail the train into a psychoanalytical mess of sorts.\n\nFor mecha, Tengan Toppa Gurren Lagann is a better (albeit cheesier in a great many ways) mecha story by the same studio. I have rewatched that show after Evangelion and have a deeper appreciation for TTGL reconstructing what Evangelion deconstructed. Simon from TTGL is a flawed character who finally ended up \"getting it\".  Shinji... well, I just don't know.  At the end of the day, I believe that an anime ultimately stands on its entertainment value. Evangelion was a chore to sit through. I didn't hate it, I certainly didn't like it, but I was very happy when I finished it and could check it off the list of \"must sees\" as I really wasn't enjoying it all that much and was a bit frustrated by how it ended.\n\nIt's tough to recommend people avoid something like Evangelion, as it is discussed so much that just about everyone who gets into this medium is going to be exposed to it sooner or later. There is some merit is seeing it if for no other reason than to help connect the dots on how anime was affected by it, but I don't consider this to be a show that I can say I enjoyed.  There are also works that offer different endings, such as End of Evangelion which can add a bit more context, but as a stand alone series, Neon Genesis Evangelion is a bit of a hot mess. \n\nBest I can offer as a final thought is to go in without preconceptions and see what you get out of it.  Hopefully it is more enjoyable for you than it was for me.  "}, {"id": 2709, "score": 40, "body": "A sequel to any series is tricky, and especially for a successful series, there is a burden of expectations that needs to be fulfilled. Despite its flaws, the original manga Tokyo ghoul delivered some interesting ideas and concepts by drawing the conflict between humans and ghouls, and thereafter promised the answers to the loose ends in its sequel. Did it succeed, or at least, was able to keep the quality of its prequel? Sadly the answer is no, even though it looked like the first half of the manga is heading towards a specific direction.\n \nSome spoilers ahead for the following review, mostly from the prequel and Re.\n\nStory:- Tokyo ghoul re starts in a promising manner, after the reveal of the clowns in its prequel, with even more mystery surrounding it. The first 60-70 chapters are decent in that regard, main reason being the focus of the story seemed to move in a particular order, with narrowed focus on characters like Tsukiyama, Sasaki, or the members of the Quinx squad. However after a major event in the Cochlea arc, the story suddenly loses coherence, and the narrative quickly devolves into a mess. The worst thing about re is that the story has so many fake deaths that it becomes Fairy tail levels of ridiculousness at some points. It takes away any sort of lasting narrative impact, has zero purpose and value, but still are used with characters just to provide a temporary shock. \nThe plot armours of characters are bound to be annoying too, and the main cast, especially the Kirishima siblings show the worst side of this. Here I would also like to point out that the romantic subplot lacks any sort of proper buildup, especially considering there is a time skip of two years. The cast on the antagonist side is either fodderized after getting hyped up so much, or used as a plot device after fake deaths, and results of the fights don't follow any power levels, sometimes they are rushed too(chapter 143, just for the sake of drawing parallel).  Characters remain popping up alive, no matter if they get beaten to death, or there are supposed hints of death. The pacing remains inconsistent, like Mutsuki's arc which has a weak payoff considering to what extent it is dragged. Needless to say, the story is full of holes, but the last part is by far the worst portion of the series, which is addressed below in a separate section.\n\nCharacters- An amnesiac character is always going a step back for any sort of character, as it negates any sort of previous buildup. However if the card is pulled right, the returning of memories can always be a trigger for a huge character development. In this regard, Kaneki simply fails as a whole. After 300+ chapters, the proof that he still remains the same as the beginning are the events of chapter 144. He gives in to the same tendencies, realizes his mistakes again, rinse and repeat. Basically a stagnant character until the very end when he finally realizes how to move forward.\nOne of the main antagonist of the series who took a central figure in the later portion of the manga, had the potential to be a great antagonist at first but quickly turns into a character who simply couldn't be taken seriously. Since the readers had no idea about his thought process, background or anything, the cliche of foolproof plans always working out no matter what quickly breaks any suspense of disbelief. You hardly get to see his side of working out things, and at the end of everything you always get to see classic \"it all proceeded according to plan\", which makes nothing but a gary stu villain who has everything and everyone controlled, all situations and scenarios working out no matter what until the ending. And the other antagonists from the original series like Eto, Tatara aren't even worth mentioning considering how their characters were butchered.\nThe quinx squad are perhaps better characters of tg re in this regard, since at least they get some sort of development, Urie is probably the best example of this. The problem with the cast is that it's so bloated since they brought almost every character alive and keep on adding new investigators, that the focus on the characters go wayward, like some promising characters of the prequel are forgotten after becoming relevant for a while like Tsukiyama, or barely receive any focus or development of their own, like Nishio, Ayato, Hide etc. \n\n\nArt- Inconsistent. Some of the early volumes have decent art, but in some of the arcs like Rue Island, it's just messy and you barely have any idea of what's going on in the fights. Just a point in case here  that  the scans definitely carry some of the blame for that dark, blurry sketches since it looks a bit better for the high quality scans. \n\n\nNow to conclude, let's talk about the final portion of the manga, or the last 20-30 chapters. Worst part of the series by far, the quality goes down by another level. Characters magically coming back alive after that same trope of fake deaths just so that you can destroy their relevance in the series, or absolutely quick or no almost resolutions to the fate of the characters, rushed endings to the plotlines, everything making up a full fledged train wreck ending. In  the last chapter, we get a happy fairytale ending for the prominent characters after a few miraculous survivals that the readers have no idea of, just so the fans can be satisfied. \n\nStory- 4/10\nCharacters- 3/10\nArt- 5.5/10\n\n\nThanks for reading."}, {"id": 2719, "score": 15, "body": "I wonder: when will I ever stop falling on the trap of incestuous plot?

The conflict in the episode wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so serious that it was out of place for a first episode but was a good enough catalyst to allow for the show to present scenes that would not only set up the character dynamic for the two focus characters but also the intrigue for the audience. I liked that it told the audience directly, but not so direct that it was a shove in our faces. This show seems like it shows potential and I will be looking forward to what it will show.\n\n_REVIEW:_\nTurns out this anime is pretty run of the mill. Though it started strong with its subtle character development and various interactions that hint at a bigger picture. Whether the anime had been hard-pressed by its smaller 12 episodes or the development cycle was a bit rushed, this anime felt a bit rushed and underdeveloped in terms of both character development and in the dynamics between the various characters. There is a total of 5 characters, 2 of which are the main ones. I feel as though introducing all of them at once in the adaptation was a stupid decision on behalf of IG Production Studio since the 12 episodes weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t nearly enough to even develop the 2 main characters let alone all 5. What remains is 3 characters I really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a connection with, with the later interactions suggesting that they know each other so well that they can just act very very casually around each other. I know that leadership camp was supposed to be the catalyst for the characters to start liking each other and bond to form their main group, but it was severely underwhelming of a catalyst and as a result the group dynamic just appears rather than being developed over time. It would have been a better decision to focus on the two main characters for the anime adaptation, though judging by the ending of this anime, it was anticipating a season 2 to no avail. Anyways, in terms of the plot it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a really typical shoujo scenario: the mysterious guy, the energetic and pushy girl, the subplot love story and drama on the side (though this is not developed at all really). Despite these seemingly typical and generic features, I felt as though this anime could have done a lot more with its characters than it did, Futaba in particular suffered the most from this. Initially, she had interesting motivations and was developed throughout the first few episodes making her quite a good character to follow. After establishing herself in the group however, her personality quickly changed. I know that was a part of the series itself, but in itself it just made the show very sluggish following in the mind of this generic kind of school girl that appeals to every kind of shoujo fan. As a character, she does have some moments where she shines but they are few and far between. On the other hand, Kou is initially really kind of a douche, which does follow the typical shoujo formula. Douchebag + mysterious = nut ofc. Anyways, during the last two episodes is where the show itself starts to get interesting, because we as an audience get to experience the pain felt by Kou himself as we watch his mother slowly die in front of his eyes. This explains his personality throughout the series and we are shown his character arc. This in itself is probably the best part of the anime itself, but it is also representative of one of its biggest downfalls.\nWith shoujo anime in particular, I think that the most important thing is balance. Balancing the two main protagonists so that the audience has a chance to bond with each character and appreciate their relationship as well as their motivations behind certain actions. From this, the side characters must also be developed, so that the show is padded with some other things to care about as well and to sometimes be the catalyst for the main characters to interact. Ao Haru Ride, I think, does a bad job of balancing all aspects of what I just mentioned. Futaba is developed in the first half, Kou is developed in the second. Although chronologically this is correct since its in the persecptive of Futaba, it just makes it imbalanced in terms of development. We as an audience are given very little reason to want to cheer for the couple to develop romantically. The pace just becomes too slow with that stupid Yuuri loli coming into the mix and adding in useless filler drama. I would have much rather liked it if the anime were to focus on the main couple themselves. Whilst watching in fact, I realised that by the end of the series Kou was a much more interesting character to me, with his motivations and backstory helping to develop his character beyond the mysterious asshole he was in the majority of the series. Futaba receives no such development, instead she is given a personality to appeal to the lowest common denominator and just comes off as your typical shoujo protagonist. Though it is a part of her character arc to change in such a way, they just do nothing with this change and as a result it feels a bit wasted. Anyways, just a lack of development throughout gave me no motivation to care about the characters for most of the series, until the last two episodes where the character development is probably at its strongest. Furthermore, I feel like when the characters point out the most obvious connections the anime is treating the audience like they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re idiots. They make it really clear when things link when it can just easily be seen regardless, so I really disliked that it had to be so on the head with those revelations.\nNow, for the art. I think that the art is reminiscent of Bokura ga Ita (a better shoujo) which was charming in its own right, but with Ao Haru Ride it seemed a bit more generic when compared to Bokura ga Ita. It was cute at times, but really ugly at others. I think that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fine. What I liked in particular though were the flashbacks. Production IG could have easily just added a filter and changed the colour pallet a little, but with the flashbacks in Ao Haru Ride, using watercolour and a lighter colour pallet is really enjoyable to look at and I appreciate it.\nThe music was servicable, just your normal piano music. Worse than Kimi ni Todoke, but not too far behind. Nothing special about it really. \nOverall, this anime would have been better with Kou as the MC since Futaba is so ughhh by the end of the series. Though they do link the characters with their backstories and makes it sort of heartwarming by the end of it, just the whole middle-section of the anime makes it very hard to give this anime more than a 6. The underdeveloped side characters in combination with weak motivations of the main characters make this kind of a sluggish watch but at the same time it does kind of redeem itself slightly by the end. I think that Production IG was relying too much on a season 2 for this anime and maybe that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why it just felt both rushed and incomplete.\n"}, {"id": 2747, "score": 10, "body": "\"What is anime?\" A question many have asked and answered, but what is it really? Today I will answer that question, as well as give some insight as to why you should (not) watch Nami, which ironically enough can't be considered anime. Without further ado, let's begin!\n\nAnime as we know it today is a visual storytelling medium. Consisting of multiple key factors like story, art, animation, characters and sound, the sky's the limit for what can be produced. That does not come without its shortcomings though,    whether it's bad directing, faults in the story, jarring art/animation or poor sound, there's always something you can detract from the overall quality of an anime. Even some of the most renowned shows like Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood have flaws that can pull them down. However the topic of this review isnot the most renowned anime ever, but quite the opposite, one of the worst \"anime\" (isn't an anime by definition) ever created. Today I will take a look at the not-so critically acclaimed \"Nami\"\n\nRaise your hand if you've ever heard this one: A woman is pleasuring herself in her room, when all of a sudden a fish appears out of nowhere and slides inside of her. Raise your hand again if you expected hundreds, if not thousands of other fish to appear and slide inside the woman aswell. If you raised your hand to any of these situations, then congratulations, you've probably watched Nami. The fish appear from  wherewhere, from inside the Tv, out of walls, and even places you didn't know fish could be (not like any of the places I mentioned are locations where fish are usually at anyway.)\n\nWith the head-scratching synopsis for Nami out of the way, let's move on to something less...strange, if you will. Don't get me wrong, I don't mean less strange in the form of it not being weird, but less strange as in you will at least understand what's going on, as opposed to the wild synopsis. This less strange thing is in fact animation, the very backbone to an anime in many people's opinion. While good animation isn't necessary for an anime to be successful, it can certainly help build up tension or ambiance, depending on how it's done. In Nami however, what you see is what you get, and it is piss poor at that. From censorship (REALLY? Not this again) to awful movements from both the woman and the fish, this is definitely some of the worst \"animation\" I've ever seen.\n\nIf you thought the animation was bad, just wait until you hear the sound. The sounds the fish make are definitely some of the weirdest sounds I've ever heard. It's like a group of people are slurping up something liquidy, except it's much worse and much louder. I had to turn my sound down while watching due to it being painful to listen to.\n\nI didn't think it was possible to find something worse than Pupa, but Nami blew me out of the water with how unfathomable it is. I actually watched Nami twice, because I didn't understand it at first. While I did end up gaining some understanding for it, having to experience it not only once, but twice was an incredibly straining task that I wish I hadn't done, even if it \"only\" took 6 minutes in total. Don't watch this, you're better off doing absolutely nothing.\n"}, {"id": 2777, "score": 30, "body": "<b>DISCLAIMER</b>: This review was imported from MAL. Also, I'm fully aware that I'm part of the very minor percentage that didn't enjoy this movie at all.

There are plenty of good reviews for this movie out there, let there exist at least one that is not positive.\n\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*\n\nAkira is one of those movies that when it came out it was revolutionary, but the more it gets old, the more it's evident of how... basic it is. And I'm being very nice by just saying \"basic\" (because, to be honest, I really hated it).\n\nThe plot is... oh man, WHAT EVEN is the plot? We have 2 hours and 4 minutes of the movie and most of the time I was lost and bored. I had to google so many times to understand what was happening, what was the objective, who was this character on screen and... oh, THE ENDING. WHAT????????!!!!!\n\nNow, to be fair, I also googled about the manga and it sounds like it is more interesting, less rushed, more \"complete\" and just a whole different experience from the movie. I'm still debating whether or not I'll read it, but as far as the MOVIE ADAPTATION goes: I certainly don't recommend it!\n\nThe art is... not pretty. I get it: this is old, this is what anime looked like in the 80's, but still. The art didn't please me and it certainly pleased me even less when I focused on a character's mouth \"moving\" while they spoke (I put that word in between quotes because UGH it is so badly animated! It's like their entire face is still and only their mouths move, and barely so. I hated it.)\n\nThe characters are meh. I didn't like anyone, didn't feel a connection with absolutely any of them, I can't even remember most of their names! And some of them, I have no idea why they even existed (for example, Kei. Kaneda meets her for the first time and it's like love at first sight, he's all up for getting in her pants and I'm like: okay, but do you even KNOW this girl? who is she, why is she there, what is she going to do????)\n\nI only started to actually get interested in the story in the last 20 minutes of the film.

Because everything else is just... terrible. Part of me thinks that it's terrible <i>on purpose</i>, but even so, I couldn't bring myself to enjoy this story.\n\nHelter Skelter follows Ririko's story (more closely than any of the other characters), she's an actress/model/celebrity and also a <b>reeeeeal bitch</b>.

I <i>could</i> feel a bit of sympathy for her if she wasn't a bitch ALL THE TIME. If it was just a few moments but most of the time (or at least half of the time) she was a decent person. But that's not the case, Ririko makes sure to <b>constantly</b> be rude and a pain in the ass of everyone she meets (most importantly, her employees).\n\n[<b>MILD SPOILER WARNING</b>]She even goes far as to RAPE her P.A, TWICE.

This had the potential to be the best and most interesting part of the manga, but I can't decide which is worse: <i>this</i> or Ririko's pov.\n\nAnd while I wasn't expecting a happy ending (Ririko certainly doesn't deserve one), instead we got an open ending that does nothing for us.

If you're neither of these parties, read on with a free mind!*** Review Published June 22, 2018 on AniList\n\nGrancrest was the first seasonal I picked up in 2018 (not saying much since it released in Jan 6 anyway) and unfortunately my 2018 mean fell right off the bat. Grancrest stumbled out of the gate and fell flat on its face for the first few episodes and took a long time to get it's footing right. There are different places where I found the show good or bad, which is why I don't consider this show absolutely trash (surprise surprise, not FranXX anyway). So it's first episode started off very conveniently in such that Theo appears out of nowhere, beats the Lord after coming out of nowhere, and picks a somewhat scantily clad girl after as mentioned (not unlike most other isekai or fantasy anime, but I'm not complaining, nothing wrong with fanservice I say :P), coming out of nowhere. Sounds like a rant so I'll tone down for the next bit. \n\n~~~img520(https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ce/7d/fd/ce7dfd323afb0d3f0aa7aa1d67e0d591.jpg)~~~\n\nThe show tried introducing it's characters little by little, introducing us to examples like Lassic, Milza among others for the early episodes and introduced others later down the line too. It's always good to see that not all the cast is revealed in its first episode, but unfortunately that didn't help much because we had to make room for our Oh-so-great green haired MC, Theo. Many praised his \u00e2\u0080\u009cbadassery\u00e2\u0080\u009d and his \u00e2\u0080\u009cforward-thinking\u00e2\u0080\u009d and him \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot being dense and weak\u00e2\u0080\u009d and I was terribly confused since none felt true except for his dense part which was randomly and conveniently revealed in a later episode. That is the problem with the show, it's that it's too convenient. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh Theo is gonna die\u00e2\u0080\u009d but something convenient happens and he's saved. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh this is gonna happen\u00e2\u0080\u009d but then to benefit Theo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side it doesn't and the opposite direction is taken. I mean, the show makes Theo out to be like he's the coming of the Messiah or something. He comes, conquers VERY easily, is kind to people (more on that in a bit) and has people serve him in droves. I know it sounds like a rant but to be objective there's nothing wrong with having a righteous MC. It's just that in its current premise I doubt that's what's needed or what makes the most sense. What do I mean? The show is trying to prove that war is dark and to win a war there are sacrifices to be made but Theo goes Yang Wen-Li and wins the war without any well thought out tactics? No thank you. This isn't how you do a war show and definitely not how you make a badass MC. I mean, speaking of Yang, that show excellently shows why war is dark.\n\nWhere there is war there is loss on both sides and this MC is the complete opposite of that. Is there anything wrong with never losing? I don't think so, I mean, a guy like Yang Wen-Li has lost at least once and Theo never did? Don't joke with me A-1. If you're making your MC win as well, MAKE IT BELIEVABLE. Speaking of believable we've got the laughable \u00e2\u0080\u009cbattle tactics\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Once again, it's a show about war so it should have a proper description of what battle tactics are right? WRONG. There is absolutely no mention or any sense in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbattle tactics\u00e2\u0080\u009d involved and it's just \u00e2\u0080\u009cCharge and win\u00e2\u0080\u009d which I doubt is something that works even 10% of the time, especially when you're constantly outnumbered. A simple \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe'll attack from here and there to trap them\u00e2\u0080\u009d isn't how a battle tactic works. Sense? No, definitely not. Oh and speaking of no sense, we go back to our MC, Theo. To be fair, he did have a decent backstory, I definitely have to give credit where it's due and Theo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s backstory is one that deserves a clap. Just a clap. Why? It's because it was seldom explored after that one episode and they just threw in a pre-show romantic interest and let's just say \u00e2\u0080\u009ctried to be edgy\u00e2\u0080\u009d by giving her one heck of a bombed send-off. And bombs is not the word here. The battle tactics used there as well were close to zilch I'm sad to say. How can inexperienced commoners beat an advanced army? I sincerely apologise because I do not know. Neither did the show. \n\nThen we move to the so called \u00e2\u0080\u009cromance subplot\u00e2\u0080\u009d. It was pretty obvious that Theo would be paired up with Blondie and unfortunately as I expected it wasn't done well. Why does Japan have a hard on for ruining blonde love interests in subplots? (Once again, there are exceptions, we have seen some good blonde love interests in other anime romance subplots before but not as often as one might expect). And this isn't about hair colour here. She was underused and overblown at the same time. She had around 2-3 important lines to say in each episode that were of value, no scratch that, 2-3 important lines every 2 episodes (severely averaged for ease of comprehensive analysis). Her only use was to satisfy the fanboys who already love Theo the \u00e2\u0080\u009cHero\" and want a romance subplot with all the kisses and vows. What if you like me don't like Theo? Zannen-deshoka, you won't be satisfied at all. \n\n~~~img720(https://moesucks.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/grancrest-senki-0219.jpg)~~~\n\nYou might say Siluca herself might be able to stand on her own as a character but unfortunately that's not the case with most of the people in the cast. Why? It's because all the characters are cast as stepping stones for Theo-sama to step on and take this place as the best character and biggest badass in this anime. Result? Let's tone down before I turn this into a rant (\u00e2\u0080\u009cwait, it isn't?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I hear you say :P), disappointing. Convenience and stepping stones was the word here unfortunately. Now that I've spewed enough poison over poison, let's calm our nerves down with the plus points of the anime apart from the sadly less explored Theo backstory, the soundtrack. I'd be lying if I didn't tell you I jammed to the second OP each time it played, oh it was so epic. The music selection was needless to say, fantastic, and that's NOTHING to say of the BGM (that's BackGround Music to those who don't know), it was Grancrest's signature achievement. It sent chills down your spine and made you smile in anticipation of what's to come (spoilers: disappointment) and it pumped you up. The visuals thankfully weren't so bad in the OPs and EDs and on a personal note I loved both the EDs. You obviously may not see eye to eye with me but I loved both of them equally and served as an antidepressant for the earlier events of the episode. \n\nNow back to the negatives because I'm out of positives to give, that one scene with Milza and Theo. Since this is a major spoiler so skip approximately 3 lines if you don't want to know about this predictable fight. \n\n***Spoiler begin: The thing is that Milza had given mercy to Theo when Theo didn't ask for it and was about to be killed in the first duel, but in the second and apparently more important one, Theo kills Milza. Nani? Why? What? How? Exactly. I thought they wanted to make Theo look like the next Messiah, what happened here? Well, one could say they wanted to make Theo look badass? I don't even know anymore, needless to say, it was in all literal and figurative sense, a bloody mess. Spoiler end*** \n\n~~~img720(http://ultsubs.esy.es/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Grancrest-Senki-Episode-131.png)~~~\n\nMoving back to the stepping stones, the characters. We go with another spoiler section (will not start immediately so hold on), Alexis and Marrine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cRomeo and Juliet romance\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Pardon me while I vomit. Okay, let's continue, in terms of anime if you've seen my dropped list I've had the Romeo x Juliet anime at a 2/10 so if you like the story of it in anime form, I don't think you'll hate it so much, unless, if you treat Grancrest like it's equivalent. Romeo and Juliet, the Shakespeare play didn't focus on war as much as the romance, because surprise surprise, it's a romance first and foremost, and another important part is that there's tragedy involved. Does Grancrest follow any of these? No. Why is Marrine and Alexis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 romance related to Romeo and Juliet? Blame the fans, but that's not the issue here. It's that this type of romance won't work in a war show. \n\nI've said this many times in different situations above, Grancrest does a lot of non-war things in a war show and it ruins many of the existing things relative to war shows as well. Going back to the Romeo and Juliet part, some say the Great Hall Tragedy shown in the first scene of the anime counts as tragedy but to that I say \u00e2\u0080\u009cread the original play\u00e2\u0080\u009d. In a later episode, in the final arc, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cfinal battle\u00e2\u0080\u009d which was hyped since the first few episodes that too, went with a POOF. And by POOF I don't mean a bomb. I mean \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe anatomical juxtaposition of two orbicularis oris muscles in a state of contraction.\" As described by Henry Gibbons. In other words, a kiss. Nani? What? Why? When? What happened to the deaths and sacrifices of all those who fought leading up to this event? Why did they hype this battle if this was how it would end? What sort of timing is this??? Marriage? Kiss? Love? Unity? Nothing wrong with all these, but the question remains. If you HAD to follow it this way, then what was the meaning of those previous 20 episodes? Were they to waste? Did they serve as bait? Couldn't this series start off at like episode 16 or 18 and be an OVA? So many questions, and little to no answers. \n\nAnd so, jumping back to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's a war\u00e2\u0080\u009d excuse, in a war you have major character deaths right? Where did the major characters die? Apart from a few minor characters who were obviously forgotten after the next 2 episodes when did we see the death of a main character? Once again, to be fair and objective, there is absolutely nothing wrong with not having major deaths in an anime, I agree, but if you are indeed trying to show that Theo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side was weak, then why didn't you have important deaths? Yes, the deaths in the first half did exist and they definitely served their purpose, so that's a plus point, but we didn't see anything after that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Now, a rebuttal to what people might point fingers at my review at, I'll definitely hear the likes of \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlmost all your points against the show are targeting the war aspect of it. You don't know how war shows go. This show isn't about war, it's about blablabla\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Except for that last one which will definitely be used by those who don't even know what the anime is about (please, do not misunderstand, most of you aren't a part of this trope so do not worry), This show is all about war, it's called Grancrest Senki. So it's about war. \n\n~~~img720(https://moesucks.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/grancrest-senki-0601.jpg)~~~\n\nAnother example of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cwar show\u00e2\u0080\u009d would be Gakusen Toshi Asterisk, which according to MAL in English is \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Asterisk War\u00e2\u0080\u009d. My point? Even though their names include the word war (or at least their English counterparts) none of them actually do follow the principles of a war show, less so in Grancrest, since it's whole premise was based on it and that immediately puts it just above Asterisk. So even though Grancrest is about war it rarely sticks to the proper formula of it and no, don't tell me it's a deconstruction, I'll kill you. \n\nFinally, we move on to the last issue of the show which I'll cover, the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s artstyle. Made by A-1, I expected the show to do okay but it couldn't do that either. Character models looked weak, CGI was used in many scenes (not all), the choreography of the fight scenes themselves were so bad I cringed under my bones and to top it all off, I couldn't find it good at all even at 1080p (yes, I upscaled to 1080p episodes mid-season and still suffered with the artstyle). To go into a little more detail, the character models weren't that eye catchy and to cover for this factor they tried deploying fanservice into the war show to try and make things look attractive (oh fun fact: ever heard of showing your nude body to your army to bolster their morale? Me neither) and I'm not complaining about fanservice (since I love it when used properly) but that it's used in the wrong place and at the wrong time. Perhaps the only \u00e2\u0080\u009cfanservice\u00e2\u0080\u009d that was used at the right time was Siluca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outfit, which was\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 attractive :P\n\nApart from that the fanservice used in the show wasn't done well and A-1 after that episode stopped deploying it and went back to CGI war sequences. Once again to make it clear. I don't have any problem with fanservice, I enjoy Ecchi, it's just that they should be done at the right time, many would say that there's no such specific time for fanservice but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say otherwise. If it's not an Ecchi show, don't do random fanservice please thank you. Moving back to the main artstyle, it in simple words wasn't done well for the reasons explained above. \n\n~~~img720(http://livedoor.blogimg.jp/webdata-anime_twitter/imgs/3/a/3a312800.jpg)~~~\n\n***Spoiler begin: One of the most pathetic and biggest cop outs in the anime was how quickly they changed the villain from Marrine to the Mage Academy. It felt like a ridiculous cop out since the previous episode already ended the whole conflict of the past 20 episodes with a single \u00e2\u0080\u009cI still love you\u00e2\u0080\u009d (oh if only life and war was this easy) and as such this obviously leaves a hugely negative taste in the viewer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth. But wait! There were still 4 more episodes! How ever could they fill them? By adding another villain and acting like \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey were the villain all along\u00e2\u0080\u009d sort of crap. So, the whole 20 episodes of what you watched was for nothing bc Marrine suddenly became good and the last 4 episodes are important because the Mage Academy were the villains all along? They never showed up in the show before though? No mention of them was made and nothing was talked about. Yet they suddenly and extremely conveniently make their appearance to quickly put an end to the cries of \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat was the point of the past 20 eps???\u00e2\u0080\u009d and from what I can see, that failed spectacularly. They continued with this bullish nature till the end\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Spoiler end***\n\nFor anyone wondering about it's ending, Grancrest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ending does bring closure. Although on the cliched Shoujo side. It had it's purpose to play. The first half of the episode was as disappointing as you'd expect from the show. But the second half tried to mend those to little avail. Yeah it was cute I could say but such an ending is the same as what happened with the Marrine vs Alexis war\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Not something I'd call amazing but eh, it served it's purpose I guess\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I guess they wanted to follow the fairytale? Either way, Grancrest left me unimpressed.\n\nAnd so with a heavy heart I must conclude that Grancrest isn't at all what I'd like to call a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood\u00e2\u0080\u009d show this year. It's plot was excrutiatingly convenient, the characters were made such that they were stepping stones for Theo, Marrine and Alexis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 romance was horribly handled and had a ridiculously lame \u00e2\u0080\u009cresolution\u00e2\u0080\u009d later on, the Artstyle wasn't what I expected, the battle tactics weren't at all present, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cfinal battle\u00e2\u0080\u009d was a laughable cop out, etc. the show had one or two positive points to it namely the soundtrack that was brilliantly done and Theo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s backstory was somewhat decent (although that fell apart soon after). This is all I can say to end on a positive note on this semi-rant and semi-review hybrid, not unlike my Dakara boku wa H ga dekinai review which was done in my old format back when the year started. If you made it till here, thank you for taking the time to read this review and if you do decide to watch Grancrest, please don't expect too much of it because the end result is far lower than that. Most of what you expect from Grancrest can be found elsewhere in shows that are actually good anyway right?\n\n>~~~FANSERVICE~~~\n~~~img720(https://img.fireden.net/a/image/1515/16/1515165485425.jpg)~~~\n\nStory: 2.5\nAnimation: 2\nSound: 7\nCharacter: 1.5\nEnjoyment: 2.5\n\nOverall: 3.1\n"}, {"id": 2804, "score": 42, "body": "~~~__THIS IS MY FIRST REVIEW IN MY LIFE, REDACTED IN JAN 25, 2018__~~~\n\nI wanted to see how interesting the most famous anime in Japan 2017 can be. Spoiler: Total disappointment.\n\n__History__\nWe are located in a distant future in which humanity came to develop an artificial intelligence capable of thinking for itself. (Lucky Beast).\nInside a park (natural reserve, or something else) abandoned by the hand of humans, a girl is born from a volcano to discover that animals are transformed into humanoid species capable of reasoning and speaking perfect Japanese, called FriendS. There, she meets Serval, whose name comes from the Serval animal (WOW HOW MANY TIME THEY HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT). These two \"girls\" have an adventure inside this park to go to the library and discover what kind of animal is Kaban (Spoiler alert: A human). In this, we, like viewers (and Kaban) discovers that there are badly made and blue robots called Ceruleans, which eat the FriendS to turn them back into animals. They also know Lucky Beast, an artificial intelligence that could well be the reason for the extinction of THE WHOLE HUMANITY.\nAfter many adventures through the different biomes of the park, they come to the library to discover that Kaban is actually AN ALIEN, haha no, is a person, (WOW PLOT TWIST). Then, the two owls teachers without expression, say that the last time they saw a person was in the port, so our two protagonists are on their way to the sea, but it turns out that Lucky Beast begins to show holograms or pre-recorded messages of Mirai, a zoologist who had a lot of attachment with the FriendS in the past.\nAfter all that happened, BOOM, a giant cerulean, juicy and black appears (ignore the juicy part, please). That is when our human protagonist comes up with the brilliant idea of \u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008battracting him to the water because... wait, we need to invent a reason, fast... ah yes, she comes up with the brilliant idea of \u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008battracting him to the water because ceruleans dies in the water (WTF REALLY?).\nThe cerulean swallows Serval, Kaban saves it, the cerulean swallows Kaban, Serval is left unconscious, she wakes up, she goes where the cerulean, all the FriendS are in a pitched battle against the cerulean, they take out a nucleus that seems to be Kaban, Serval directs the cerulean to the sea with a burning paper airplane (which surprisingly was still working as if nothing) and the cerulean RIP, dies, goodbye, wow. So with what remains of Kaban (A PERSON), the FriendS (knowing that it is a person) just complain and say that it will become its original form (a person), then the core starts to shine and BOOM, Kaban is unharmed (with all her clothes?, really?) and there they all confirm that she was really AN ALIEN, nah, a person, wow, I didn't expect that \u00c2\u00ac\u00c2\u00ac.\nThe story closes with Kaban traveling to an island that seems to be Japan along with some FriendS.\nAnyway, history leaves us with the intrigue of what the park really is, what happened to humans, what happend to the park in the past, and a lot of open questions. \n\n__Art__\nHey, well, CGI. Here we can highlight the big budget of the study.\n\n__Sound__\nI was really surprised by the OST of this anime, the opening, the ceruleans theme and songs of PPP are the best thing in this anime.\n\n__Characters__\nI like how all the friends act like their respective animals, the same with their design.\nIn the case of Kaban, lack of character depth, because a normal person would want answers, and many.\n\n__Entertainment__\nI read a while ago that the Japanese were interested in this anime because they could get together in groups and get many theories and hypotheses about the background of the story. For maintaining the intrigue, but leave many open answers, it deserves a 4,2/10."}, {"id": 2842, "score": 0, "body": "The story of GGO Alternative follows the adventures of Karen Kohiruimaki, LLENN in game, and Pito (ingame name) in the online VR video game Gun Gale Online. The story focuses around two GGO tournaments: \"Squad Jam 1\" and \"Squad Jam 2\". The ideas behind the plot are really really simple and the first episodes are indeed quite enjoyable. However problems arise quickly later on. **The following sections are filled with various spoilers from the show**.\n\n~~~img720(http://www.anime-evo.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/GGO_01_5.jpg)\nLLENN~~~\n\nIt is revealed before the second tournament that Pito is indeed quite a lunatic. She's apparently obsessed by the idea of death and, of course, she's a big fan of the Sword Art Online video game that she missed the \"pleasure\" to play. This results in a pretty weird development of the story in wich apparently Pito swears to commit suicide in case she'll end up killed in Squad Jam 2. At some point it is even implied that she's actually using the SAO gear to play and not the safe one that is now the standard to play VR games like GGO (which by the way ends up being a big bullshit).\n\nSo for some unclear reasons it turns out that the only way to stop Pito is for LLENN to kill her which does not seem like a clever thing since killing all the other teams so that Pito's one will be the last one (i.e. the winner) makes much more sense to me. And of course LLENN is as OP as it is possible to be so that wouldn't be a problem at all.\n\nThe big problems I have with this show all arise at the very end, when Pito's identity is revealed (even if it's so obvious that if you can't figure it out yourself by episode 4/5 then you're probably in a deep coma). The show spend something like half of its episodes to characterize Pito as a lunatic, sadistic, cruel demon that loves to torture and kill people but then when her actual self is revealed we find out that she's literally the cutest, adorable and friendly (too friendly) character in the whole show. That does not make the slightest amount of sense. The actual frustrating thing is that they could have accomplished the same finale without introducing all the death stuff just fine and it would have been way better.\n\n~~~img720(https://www.animesolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Sword-Art-Online-Alternative-Gun-Gale-Online-03_05.00_2018.04.21_19.05.36.jpg)\nPito~~~\n\nPutting those problems aside GGO Alternative has some nice perks as well; particularly its OSTs. As a long time fan of Starving Trancer I can't help but love the music of this show. Starving Trancer's particular style is perfect for GGO and particularly it's a perfect fit for LLENN: the fact that its music is entirely digital, with a big amount of synth used, makes it the right choice for a digital world as that of GGO. The sounds of a composer that worked for many years on music for different Rhythm Games were speed is a big concern are perfect for a character whose main feature is its speed like LLENN; it just fits her perfectly (I'll leave a Starving Trancer song below). I've lost the count of how many times I've rewatched the\nfight in episode 1 just because the music was so awesome.\n\n~~~youtube(https://youtu.be/DzwaYYbb2Hs)~~~\n\nSo should you watch GGO Alternative? Probably not. I would suggest it only to hardcore SAO fans or hardcore Starving Trancer fans. If you want to give it a try don't expect too much.\n\nP.S: the 0/100 below is just because I don't feel like scoring anime \"objectively\" any longer so don't consider it at all.\n\n"}, {"id": 2845, "score": 43, "body": "Back when I started the show as it aired on January 13 I liked Beatless. It had coloured me with joy and anticipation since it's first episode went so well. Compared to the other anime I started at the time, it felt like it could do a lot with it's premise. Tut Tut. It went out like a light for the whole first half and took a while to set itself on track, and unfortunately not the same track as I felt in episode 1, but hey, it had a direction, so that's already better than FranXX. \n\nHaving said that, Beatless is far from perfect, despite throwing around it's ideology that robots do not make mistakes (and proving that wrong afterwards) it felt unnatural to see such robots (or hiEs if you may). The plot just kept on throwing random stuff at my face, sometimes Lacia is an idol taken straight from Aikatsu (Aikatsu Robot? Well that's redundant) and sometimes she's a fashion idol that makes Arato\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart throb, not mine. Needless to say, it was inconsistent. It's inconsistent plot was evidenced in the first 7 weeks of it's run- I mean, episodes (will explain later) as it tried this thing or that. It began very badly after it's first episode and couldn't keep up till around episode 8 or 9 where it decided on one direction and stuck to it. How well that went is for us to judge, and my score can tell that enough. It was horrible in its first half. \n\nAside from these inconsistencies we also had the shocking revelation that the voice acting for a few actors was bad. Namely Shiori and Kengo. They sounded very much fake, or robotic if you love puns as much as I do. Shiori sounded like she was making her debut and failed at it (I will be very surprised if I find out this actually was her debut). But out with that, a huge problem with the anime was it's convenience. Whenever a convenient problem came, Arato conveniently solved it and conveniently everything went according to plan. Not the best thing to do to be honest. Apart from that as mentioned these random irrelevant plot points just came along and made the show feel like a cluttered up mess (trying not to jab at FranXX a second time here). Many times I felt irritated by the show not trying to focus properly on whatever the heck it wanted to be doing but alas, rarely did the rabbit go down it's respectful hole. \n\n~~~img720(https://www.animesolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Beatless-03_00.38_2018.01.26_17.47.54.jpg)~~~\n\nMoving away from that we come to another massively irritating part of the anime, the villains. Or should I say whatever the heck they tried to be. Let's start with Ginga. Watarai Ginga had a lot of potential since he was the former partner of the creator of the Lacia-class hiEs and his backstory could have been done better, but unfortunately they screwed up what could have been a great backstory and instead, mowed him down in terms of development during the series. He felt plastic. Not unlike cliched shounen villains who have no purpose other than \u00e2\u0080\u009cto destroy\u00e2\u0080\u009d. It was pretty irritating to be able to predict when Ginga would come or what Ginga would do, and though that ultimately let him to his super-predictable defeat (in the most shounen way possible), that's not an excuse especially when that's who you painted as the real villain. But ok, you do you Beatless. \n\nAfter that predictable defeat someone had to take his role of villain and they brought out the randomly created and introduced Erika Burrows, which I think is the most Nippon Western name I could come up with, but anyway, apart from showing how cryogenics can be successful (that's a debate for another day) she proved that Beatless could get a worse villain than Ginga. Her actions were unexplained, her motives were set aside (\u00e2\u0080\u009cI want something interesting\u00e2\u0080\u009d? Pls, you're rich, go get a PC and play games or something) and the way the show painted her personality was far from what I could call decent. I already complained about Ginga, so this can explain how bad she is. You might say she's not a villain, but if that's indeed true, then she has absolutely NO use in this show since she'd just become a nobody. \n\nMethode was introduced as that proud hiE who can beat em up and has good taste in sunglasses (trust me, those sunglasses, I need them) but she was pretty much another cliched villain who didn't improve. Although she had the motives, the way she carried it out and her brief appearances altogether shunted the true potential of this Character as well, another character with wasted potential. Now we move from bad villains to bad characters overall, namely our idiot MC, Arato. Arato was your average cherry boy. Apart from predictably falling in love with a robot his actions were as he said it himself, idiotic and uncalculated. In episode 19, they revealed what was the point of this incalculable mess of a character but not in the way you'd hope to call decent yet again. \n\n~~~img720(https://animeforums.net/uploads/monthly_2018_01/kouka-beatless-anime-e03-3.jpg.32904d77bd7df49a0c9e27c742c547ad.jpg)~~~\n\nThen we move over to the other hiEs, Kouka was the one with a hard on Onee-san fetish but in all honesty I was rooting for her. She was literally the only character in the show I liked and as such I lost my mind completely in episode 16. If you like Kouka too, her actions in episode 16 will leave you in a fit of rage, since it was unexplained, random and rage inducing. Snowdrop was shown as that Loli robot (great diversity Diomedea) who eats other robots to gain power and can make humans lose their sanity (?) and do weird stuff which was noticed in the first episode just before Arato was rescued by Lacia. To date, I've yet to understand what she was doing and why but eh, let's move on, the last hiE to cover (Methode was covered above) is Saturnus, describing her will be a lot like Erika Burrows, in that it's a bit of a spoiler, although she has nothing to do in the plot I can freely tell you without spoilers that she has no use at all in the plot. Satisfying the maid fetish fans might have (yet again, great diversity Diomedea), all she did apart from that is go \u00e2\u0080\u009cyes\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009clet's do this\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009calright\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Those were 80% of her lines for the whole show. Underused? You betcha. \n\nNow since I've been spewing all the negatives, let's neutralise with something that is both positive and negative, the sound. First the good, the music was great, the synth tracks used made it only the second show to extensively use synth tracks for it's soundtrack and BGM this year and needless to say it was well done. The OP/EDs as well did not disappoint. Now here comes the bad. Too much focus was kept into the music to do great in the other places. Production and budgeting wasn't done well since it was all about making that soundtrack and licensing the music, sadly this killed off the budget to focus on the other parts and so ultimately led to the downfall of the anime. Speaking of production issues, THE DAMN RECAPS. We had around 4-5 recaps for this 24 episode show. Let that seep in. Should a show get this many? I say no. Why did this show have so many recaps? Budgeting? We'll perhaps never know, but point is, I don't want to have a recap episode thrown at my face after waiting for a week. It's frustrating. For those who are binge watching it as well, the episodes are part of the show so it gets really irritating to see the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cRecap Episode\u00e2\u0080\u009d show up in your news feed. It cuts off from the main action badly. Oh wait, that itself is a fault in the show. \n\nIt's transition from one scene to another is random and pretty much tiring to watch. I can't tell you how fed up I was of this. And let's not forget the fact that our Lacia-class hiEs were given absolutely NO SENSIBLE EXPLANATION. Apart from very minor dips into their backstories, the hiEs never had their purpose of creation explained apart from one line or the other, lines like \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm created to help humanity move forward\u00e2\u0080\u009d isn't going to earn an excuse. You need proper explanation which sadly wasn't given. Now it's not all bad though. Apart from being my guilty pleasure of the year it did have good things in it. It's plot improved considerably in it's second half, which although wasn't obviously flawless, it was a nice improvement all the same, as a person who was pissed with the first half even the mediocre-decent bracket it was in felt good to me. \n\n~~~img720(http://lostinanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Beatless-01-03.jpg)~~~\n\nAnother important thing is that despite it's recaps, Beatless wasn't a rushed show. I never felt that it was rushed most of the time and the pace was pretty good in itself since I could easily watch the show without getting too much information at once. Another important point is that Beatless tried to do something different with it's main heroine, Lacia. Since this showed it's true colours in the last quarter of the show I won't delve in so deeply but it tried to paint her character in it's complete opposite way she was presented to us ever since the show started had mixed results, surprising because I thought it would fall flat on its face. It was well done since it changed my whole opinion of the past episodes of the show and Lacia herself. Kind of like that FranXX episode 13 which made you go \u00e2\u0080\u009coh so this is why all this happened\u00e2\u0080\u009d, only that, and please bear with me on this one, it was done much better than FranXX. \n\nIf you asked me to compare FranXX and Beatless\u00e2\u0080\u0099 first episodes, FranXX easily beat it but the answer is the complete opposite if you ask me their overall position. Yes. Beatless is better than FranXX. Despite it's crazed amount of stupidity, Beatless had a direction to follow. FranXX didn't. It took Beatless 7 episodes to find its purpose and the direction it should be following, FranXX on the other hand couldn't at all find what it wanted to do, it kept on changing every episode, therefore butchering it's consistency. If I talked to the Yasaal in January about this he'd have laughed me off the room because both shows certainly didn't show their true colours until later, FranXX with it's terrible attempts at relating to teenagers with a horrible consistency and Beatless\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lame cliches coupled with bad villains, constant recaps but a somewhat proper direction (?). They're close, but Beatless edges out FranXX. Why am I comparing the two? It's natural to compare two shows of a similar level. \n\nWhat started out as a guilty pleasure quickly turned into a show that made me impressed how a lame show can at least attempt at standing up and manage to somewhat achieve that. An E for Effort? You bet, might even give it a D+ if you like, because even though it had a lot of issues, Beatless was in itself a guilty pleasure to watch. Oh, and to satisfy all the fetishes with the hiEs, a responsible older partner (Lacia), the wild girl (Kouka), the proud girl (Methode), the Maid (Saturnus) and the Loli (Snowdrop), Diomedea, you sure have satisfied the fetishes. At this rate I might have a fetish of watching bad shows for guilty pleasure if I don't stop, but to Diomedea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s credit, Good Taste lads. Now we wait for the next few months till those last 4 episodes come out. How unclimactic...\n\n~~~img720(https://moesucks.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/beatless-18-3.jpg)~~~\n\nStory: 2.5\nAnimation: 5.5\nSound: 8 (Dat synth, dat expense on sound, dat BGM, dem OP/EDs)\nCharacter: 1.5 (Solely because of Lacia last quarter and a few characters [Kouka] here and there is this not a zero)\nEnjoyment: 4 (guilty pleasure and somewhat decent improvement in the second half compared to first)\n\nOverall: 4.3\n"}, {"id": 2851, "score": 30, "body": "Kenya Boy is a film that left me at a complete loss for words. \n\nFirst of all, it's a bad film. There's really no way to polish that turd. It fails on nearly every level. The writing is bad, the production is bad, it feels like literal propaganda at times...but the thing that makes this so unique even among bad films is just how bizarre and unusual it is in its badness.\n\nLet's start with the production. This film came out in spring of 1984, and one might be inclined to give its production a pass because \"it's old.\" However, when we consider that Hayao Miyazaki's legendary Nausica of the Valley of the Wind _also_ came out in spring of 1984, we can see that no, there's definitely a standard this film should've met. Instead, what we get is a film that at times appears half-finished. Action scenes will occasionally jump into black-and-white, as if the characters have suddenly found themselves transported into the music video for Take on Me. Anything regarding water is particularly bad, as it and everyone in it are often left uncolored even when everything else in the frame is.\n\n~~~img500(http://u.cubeupload.com/DaLadybugMan/vlcsnap2018070111h16.png)~~~\n\nWhat's more, the animation is plagued with all sorts of gaffes and continuity errors. Clothes come on and off underwater. The landscape shakes during a zoom shot, as if the cells weren't properly pinned down. And in one scene, there are characters who are just flat-out outlines.\n\n~~~img500(http://u.cubeupload.com/DaLadybugMan/vlcsnap2018063021h36.png)\n\nimg500(http://u.cubeupload.com/DaLadybugMan/unknown.png)~~~\n\nThat particular scene is absolutely filled with issues. At one point, the protagonist and his attackers end up switching skin colors. \n\n~~~img500(http://u.cubeupload.com/DaLadybugMan/186vlcsnap2018070111h33.png)\n\nimg500(http://u.cubeupload.com/DaLadybugMan/vlcsnap2018070111h33.png)~~~\n\nThis appears to be purely an animation error until we see a scene of two of these attackers looking shocked, then ducking behind their shields, reemerging as they once were, which means that the filmmakers decided to either cover up an error by drawing attention to it and making it look intentional, or just flat-out meant to make the mistake in the first place. Either way, it's the most bizarre choice possible.\n\n~~~img500(http://u.cubeupload.com/DaLadybugMan/vlcsnap2018070111h36.png)\n \nimg500(http://u.cubeupload.com/DaLadybugMan/e25vlcsnap2018070111h36.png)\n\nimg500(http://u.cubeupload.com/DaLadybugMan/b7fvlcsnap2018070111h36.png)~~~\n\nThe end effect of all of this is that the animation has this surreal, almost SHAFT-ian look to it, and some of it is even clearly intentional! However, it's impossible to tell how much of it was someone's artistic vision and how much was just a lack of time, resources, and talent that kept it from reaching a certain bar of technical competence.\n\nThe other aspects of the production are less visibly bad, but bad nonetheless. The voice acting is flat, the music selection is limited and songs will often continue to play once they're no longer appropriate for the scene, and the camera work and framing are often shoddy.\n\nWith that out of the way, let's move on to the story. The only way I can think of describing what the hell Kenya Boy is about is by attempting to recap it.\n\nWataru is a boy visiting Kenya with his father in the 1940s, seemingly for business. However, a rhino attack ends up separating the two. Wataru ends up meeting a chieftain named Zega who has fallen ill. Zega kills a panther who was ambushing them and then asks Wataru to bring him water to save his life. He also notes that, as Wataru is Japanese, he must be very brave. Many different characters throughout this movie will end up echoing this sentiment. \n\nThis is where the movie begins taking its truly strange turns, as in the process of retrieving the water, Wataru encounters and fights a giant frog.\n\n~~~img500(http://u.cubeupload.com/DaLadybugMan/vlcsnap2018070112h04.png)\n~~~\nAfter the frog is vanquished, Wataru returns to Zega, who, as thanks for saving his life, resolves to look out for him and help him find his father. They encounter a giant purple snake, which eats a lion but completely leaves them alone. This snake is apparently named Dahna and later becomes something of their giant, purple pet. After this, Wataru goes through a training montage where he learns to better fend for himself in the wilderness.\n\n~~~img500(http://u.cubeupload.com/DaLadybugMan/vlcsnap2018063021h10.png)\n~~~\nWe skip to three years later, where both Wataru and his father are apparently still independently wandering around the African wilderness, looking for each other. Wataru scales a mountain, as he believes for some reason his father would be there, and instead meets a white girl with blonde hair named Kate. Kate is being worshipped by a goddess as a tribe, who provide human sacrifices to her. Wataru interrupts the ceremony and saves the men set to be sacrificed. After this, the tribe either starts a wildfire to smoke them out or just take advantage of a wildfire that starts naturally. It's kind of unclear which. In the process, Zega is blinded by burns to his eyes and is taken captive.\n\nAs Wataru launches a rescue mission under the cover of night, Kate goes to the hut where Zega is kept captive, putting a damp cloth over his burned eyes and thanking him and Wataru for foiling the ceremony, because she doesn't actually want people sacrificed to her. Wataru enters the hut, but is quickly discovered. He escapes with Kate, leaving Zega, the man he initially came to save, behind (for whatever reason).\n\nThe next day, Zega is forced to fight to the death against lions, and reveals that he is no longer blind. Wataru comes back to save him again, and the two escape on Dahna. Wataru's father arrives just in time to see his son ride off on a giant purple snake and also to end up getting chased by the pursuing tribesmen. He is rescued by--and I am not making this up--a Nazi named Von Goering.\n\nAfter their escape, Kate and Wataru go swimming, at which point Kate is kidnapped while underwater by a cult that dresses like lizards.\n\n~~~img500(http://u.cubeupload.com/DaLadybugMan/vlcsnap2018063021h55.png)~~~\n\nIn escaping, they are also taken in by the Nazi and his cronies, allowing for Wataru to finally reunite with his father. However, the Nazi locks them up to use as a bargaining chip to get a scientist to create an atomic bomb for him. The scientist agrees, but as our heroes escape, he locks himself in a room with the Nazi, revealing he's already completed an atom bomb and will use it to blow the two of them up. I am unsure how exactly he built an atomic bomb with such limited range, but apparently he has.\n\nWataru, his father, Zega, and Kate all flee. Then the atomic bomb goes off, and then there are dinosaurs. This may be a metaphor for...something, but then again, we also see Dahna fighting a T-rex, so it's incredibly unclear what the hell is happening through this entire extended sequence.\n\n~~~img500(http://u.cubeupload.com/DaLadybugMan/vlcsnap2018063022h17.png)\n\nimg500(http://u.cubeupload.com/DaLadybugMan/vlcsnap2018070113h13.png)~~~\n\nAfter this, the dinosaurs just kind of turn into skeletons and disintegrate, and our heroes find themselves by a train station. Kate, Wataru, and his father all get on the train and head off to end their trip in Africa. And that's where the movie ends.\n\nThe story of this film is the most bizarre, confusing thing, especially when combined with the limited and often surreal animation. It's primarily a straightforward, grounded story about a boy and his father getting separated in the wilderness, but it's peppered with so many odd elements that don't seem to make sense within the world. What's more, the characters will often make bizarre, confusing decisions. Why did Wataru and his father wander around the wilderness for 3 years instead of trying to reach the nearest population center to meet up or at least organize some sort of search mission? Why did Wataru leave Zega behind after he went to the village specifically to rescue him? Then there's the fact that none of the plots seem to organically lead into each other or be connected in any way. The tribesmen who worship Kate have nothing to do with the lizard cultists, who have nothing to do with the Nazis. They're all only barely linked by Wataru's search for his father.\n\nHowever, I would be remiss if I didn't at least attempt to give credit where credit is due, so let's look at the positives of this film. I have to point out that, despite all its issues, it is surprisingly reserved in terms of how it treats race, and apart from everyone's  constant proclamations that the Japanese are brave and strong, feels less and less like a propaganda film as it goes along. I mean, it's still not actually _good_ at either of those things, but the film isn't as offensive as you would assume a 1984 film called \"Kenya Boy\" would be. And as I mentioned earlier, it does attempt to experiment with its animation, even if it ultimately doesn't work and often looks more like an animation mishap.\n\nUltimately, this is a film that would be torturous to watch alone. Not only is it as bafflingly bad as it is, it's also not a particularly short film and feels longer than it is due to slow pacing and segmented storytelling structure. However, as a \"Bad Movie Night\" film to watch with other people, it's absolutely fantastic, as it's not only bad, but bizarre. Watching Kenya Boy is definitely an experience, but what sort of experience it is depends on whether or not it's a shared one. Due to how fun it can be while watched with others, and for its attempts to do something somewhat creative, Kenya Boy earns at least a few points from me. 3/10."}, {"id": 2857, "score": 38, "body": "Note: This is my first review on AniList here.\n\nThis is a show that at first seems like it shouldn't be a show based on the factors that its based off a manga. That and the fact that I got this on one of my anime forums as my lottery pick so that is a yay for that moment of getting this show. Also, there may be spoilers in this review so be warned on that area.\n\nSTORY: 3\nOh, how I can say this is in a nice way. It's like a basketball hoop with it being too many holes and the ball going around the hoop and not going into the net as it went to the opposing team. This is what I feel by this show as it confusing to know in where everyone is and doing at that particular time during the episode.\n\nThe plot that it's trying to sell seems \"interesting\" and you do see a variety of games that are played throughout the 12 episode run so I will commend them for that. But a big negative is that it seems to be the only positive in a badly written show. This is for two reasons, the first one being the fact that it has kept changing who we are following in a certain scene. The jumps between these scenes are something that I can only cringe at.\n\nThe second reason is their \"plot twists\" which can be easily seen from a mile away with the second half being all about seeing dominance over everyone that has an SCM and some stupid characters which easily fall into putting it on. Like how can you fall for that trap that is so easy to not fall in.\n\nANIMATION: 4\nI don't have much to say as I am not really one for animation purposes. But the animation in this show is something that you don't really want to put your time in. Basically what I am saying here is the fact that the animation is nothing special at all compared to other shows that are in this season of shows.\n\nSOUND: 3\nI am a person who doesn't mind watching the full OP/ED as I know what is coming up. But compared to some of the other shows in this season, the OP song just felt flat compared to some of the others. The ED was a little bit better but was the same thing as I didn't really feel like it was a good way to end that episode. Maybe that could have been because I was relieved that the episode was over or something completely different like almost falling asleep.\n\nCHARACTER: 4\nBefore you go and attempt to try and murder me let me explain on this area. Doing a quick little search on another anime listing site shows that there are 20 characters in the show. Now for some shows, this does works in their favour. Especially if it's a long series which is more than 12 episodes that the show runs for. For others, this format doesn't work. This is one of those shows which is of the former with the fact that there is really no characters which I could fill in the shoes. In fact, if you wanted to me to name my favourite character of the show I couldn't give one.\n\nThis also didn't help the fact that they thought that introducing a character in almost every episode (barring the last one). This didn't help in tracking which characters were where at that time. By the time, the second half of the show started, I gave up on keeping track of characters and where they were and what they were doing. With a limited period, these characters don't get screen time to fully introduce themselves before falling victim to the SCM or being annoying as a cat on your lap.\n\nENJOYMENT: 4\nOverall my experiences for this show was something that I want to forget very easy as I said earlier in this review, the show as a whole is something that could easily be forgettable and not many (if any) will be talking about this show in a years time or even six months time. That is how forgettable this show is to the audience that watched it.\n\nDo I recommend this show to the people that are reading this review? The simple answer to that is no. There are other shows that came out in this season that is worth your time more than this one."}, {"id": 2862, "score": 35, "body": "Tsubasa Chronicle is a shounen title based on the manga from female mangaka group CLAMP. It tells the tale of Syaoran and Princess Sakura, two young adults who live in the kingdom of Clow County. Syaroan is the adopted son of Fujitaka Kinomoto, an archaeologist who introduces Syaroan to the world of mining. One evening, the ruins where an archaeological expedition are taking place glow with a mysterious power. Syaroan investigates this and finds Sakura there in a hypnotic state. Her memories are soon scattered from her to different dimensions (or worlds) in the form of feathers. Additionally, strange soldiers with elongated claws soon appear in Clow County and go after Sakura and Syaroan. With the assistance of Yukito, the high priest, Syaroan and Sakura are transported to the location of the Dimensional Witch, Yuuko. There they obtain Mokona, a small white rabbit creature who can teleport between worlds, to aid them on their quest. Also joining them are two others who have been teleported to the Dimensional Witch \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Fai, a magician who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s escaping his home country in fear of a king, and Kurogane, a swordsman who was transported against his will to the Dimensional Witch and who wishes to return to his home world.\n\nTsubasa Chronicle is an interesting anime on account that it features characters found in CLAMP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other works. Sakura and Syaoran, for example, are main characters in CLAMP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s famous manga Cardcaptor Sakura. The characters aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily \u00e2\u0080\u009creused\u00e2\u0080\u009d, as they have different backstories from their other material, but their personalities are roughly the same. As of this review, I am not familiar with the entirety of CLAMP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character lineup, so a few cameo appearances may have gone over my head (such as Mokona\u00e2\u0080\u0099s excited reaction to knowing who the Amen\u00e2\u0080\u0099osa are in Episode 11). That said, Tsubasa Chronicle isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, to my knowledge, a sequel of any show nor depends on previous manga knowledge to watch, so they serve more as fan-service than something crucial to understanding the show.\n\nCLAMP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s idea for the show is another point of interest. The concept of jumping between worlds has lots of opportunities to let creativity fly. Though I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t met (since this is really relative to whoever is viewing the anime), it left me feeling more disappointed than amazed. I would like to say the problem stems from CLAMP being overly ambitious in their pursuit, having a lot of ideas but not really knowing how to execute them. As a result, it left me trying to find ways to generate hype and excitement instead of it naturally coming from watching the anime. \n\nSome of these problems lie mainly with the characters. Fai is running away from his home world, but it is really unclear why outside of that the king wants to get him. The king is shown trapped in some crystal at the beginning of the anime, but how he got there and what else is going on in Fai\u00e2\u0080\u0099s world is a mystery. Fai could be a traitor or maybe someone wrongly accused of something, but after 26 episodes, it still remains unknown. Despite Fai being known as a magician, he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use any magic in this series. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t because he lost it, but more to the fact that with his \u00e2\u0080\u009ctattoo\u00e2\u0080\u009d gone, he refuses to use it. As the episodes progress, it seems Fai is more in place to be the \u00e2\u0080\u009cyang\u00e2\u0080\u009d to Kurogane\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cyin\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a balance in dynamics more so than an actual character. Kurogane is a more explicit example \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in a flashback, it is revealed that he has a curse upon him by the princess of his land. Due to Kurogane\u00e2\u0080\u0099s violent nature, this curse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effect is that Kurogane gets weaker with every person he kills. This is an idea that can be explored as a way of Kurogane learning about inner strength as opposed to just outer strength. Despite this, these opportunities are passed by \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not once does Kurogane kill someone in this series. Considering his alarming backstory (killing countless people just to prove he was the strongest in the land), the fact that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so reserved in the present is a rather sudden shift. To me, it would be more effective to see the results in action (such as Kurogane losing against opponents we know he could defeat) rather than have a constant fear of what the consequences would look like.\n\nTsubasa Chronicle also has a heavy use of supernatural elements. These can add a bit of flavor to an anime but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not too fond of them here. The problems with the magical powers stem from how they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re used in each of the worlds. In the first world, animal-like familiars called \u00e2\u0080\u009cKudan\u00e2\u0080\u009d assist everyone present in fights or day-to-day life. The main party also receives these Kudan, but because of the lack of depth they are given in this \u00e2\u0080\u009carc\u00e2\u0080\u009d, they feel more like a way to resolve a plot or continue the story than the spiritual extension that they are supposed to represent. Consider Fai\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Kudan \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it appears for one scene only and is only used to help Fai fly to the top of a building. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the only time magical elements appear once. Supposedly, Mokona serves as a magical \u00e2\u0080\u009ctranslator\u00e2\u0080\u009d for the party so they can understand each other \u00e2\u0080\u0093 when removed from the party, they cannot communicate. This only happens in the first arc after Mokona is temporarily away from the party. Since the range of Mokona\u00e2\u0080\u0099s power is unknown, and also considering the party splits occasionally with no issues in translation, this feels like an issue that was forgotten and used to add tension to the one scene it was present in. You could argue that this feeling of false tension happens a lot in this series. During the tournament episode (which, according to what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve read, is a filler episode!), Fai warns the party that the fighters of this region can shoot lightning from their hands! Instead of feeling uneasy for our heroes, we see Kurogane brush off the attack like it was nothing and Syoaran dodging these wild shots with ease. No tension is truly felt because our characters don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to worry about the threat. It takes the idea of a tournament full of tough fighters and trivializes it. Perhaps Fai disqualifying himself and Kurogane for stepping out of the ring without an actual fight summarizes it best. These are but a few of the instances of Tsubasa Chronicle putting more stock in the fact that it has magic rather than knowing how to properly use it.\n\nThe animation studio for Tsubasa Chronicle is Bee Train. Though the backgrounds and scenery are pleasant as is, the animation quality is little more than mediocre. Long stills are used frequently in the first half and CLAMP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s style of drawing people (long limbed and thin people) can look rather goofy in some of the mid-shots or long shots. Even during key frames, there is still something to be desired. During most of the emotional or serious scenes, the characters display neutral or mute faces. This makes the characters look like they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care about what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening. There are times when some fluidity occurs in the animation, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s far and few between episodes. As for sound, the music is a bit sparse but it has a decent amount of variance. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a female chorale piece that wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sound too far out of place on the later Madoka Magica soundtrack, a sad string piece, and a moody jazz arrangement amongst one or two other tracks. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not bad, but the limitations are present and I fell out of favor with some of the music due to it being played too often (the female chorale piece in particular). Opening BLAZE is a mid-tempo pop rock piece with a piano hook while ending Loop by Sakamoto Maaya is an OK acoustic guitar ballad. The seiyuus don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t display a whole lot of emotion, which again hurts the heavier scenes and makes them fall flat. The way Makino Yui (seiyuu of Sakura) says \u00e2\u0080\u009cSyaoran-kun\u00e2\u0080\u009d sounds the same in almost every scene and at times even got a bit grating to hear.\n\nOverall, I give Tsubasa Chronicle a 3.5/10. I was hoping to find more favor with this series as opposed to when I read Cardcaptor Sakura but it appears it was not the case. Perhaps those that are more familiar with the CLAMP-verse enjoyed it / will enjoy it more than I did. I cannot recommend this title.\n\nDo you like or dislike this anime?

Despite how effortless it may look with the natural flow of curvy lines his pen traces, you could very well see the thought put into every bit of detail within a single panel or illustration. The second OVA, Quiet Country Cafe, may not have consideration of how important these factors are into exhibiting the transient effect of the manga, and the end result is something that falls below average than what the source material has much to offer.\n\nBeing two episodes adapting several chapters from the manga, it aims to have a theme about Alpha temporarily leaving the cafe after it being swept up by a large typhoon, albeit the other chapters that were adapted doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really bear any connection to this beginning-and-end motif. The Misago even appears briefly with regards to a segment adapting Takahiro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perspective, yet with no relevance whatsoever. In this mishmash of random chapters being adapted it sadly takes away the fact that no matter how slow or lacking in story YKK is, it has a clear direction with each chapter meant to complement the other, yet standalone in its own right. It may have to do with this OVA consisting of simply 2 episodes, but the previous OVA also had the same amount but is structured and executed better according to its themes\u00e2\u0080\u0094a presentation of what *Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou* is. Quiet Country Cafe lacks none of these, making up a messy, out-of-context set of stories.\n\n~~~img(https://i.imgur.com/T1j0Muw.png)~~~\n\nWith a watercolor palette, the background art of Quiet Country Cafe is remarkable, blending well with the relaxing atmosphere accompanied by the Choro Club\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very playful pieces. The distinctiveness of the music plus the softly-colored set pieces within this OVA may as well be an unforgettable combination of audiovisual stimulation...if not for the lacking animation direction and jarring character models. Ashinano\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character designs, specifically his female protagonists definitely live by curvy\u00e2\u0080\u0094from the body to the face to the eyes\u00e2\u0080\u0094but the OVA takes it too far. Alpha looks like a blob, with neon green hair that is not even remotely close to her manga shade of green. In addition, the animation goes for some sneaky fanservice shots here and there, which would be fine in a normal anime, but this is supposed to be *Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou*\u00e2\u0080\u0094a work void with these elements. It takes away the wistfulness of the passage of time and distracts you with primal instincts. I do not discredit fanservice, but there are times when something needs to be put in its place, and it absolutely does not belong here.\n\n~~~img(https://78.media.tumblr.com/e33ddcafd46481019880c4c6d0324a16/tumblr_niguchwQw41tes8zmo1_500.gif)~~~\n\nThe true saving grace of this OVA lies in its soundtrack\u00e2\u0080\u0094as mentioned, with the Choro Club\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anime debut, their rendition of Cafe Alpha and several entries to mix along with the environment establishes the atmospheric mood it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aiming for. It may be arguable on which of the two soundtracks between the first and second OVA stands out, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s undeniable how both have contributed to the simple and laid-back feel in the animation. As for personal preference, Choro Club\u00e2\u0080\u0099s depiction of *Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou* sounds a bit too similar to their work in the Aria series, which is why comparisons between two iyashikei works abound more. Another thing worth praising about Quiet Country Cafe is Hekiru Shiina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reprisal of Alpha, which I believe did a fantastic job of portraying her\u00e2\u0080\u0094cheerful, yet also composed. Much of the voice cast did their characters some justice, although not to the same level Shiina has managed to justify Alpha.\n\nQuiet Country Cafe may not be a wholesome successor to the first OVA, but in its portrayal of what composes the source material is remarkable. There may not be much to gain from this series in terms of technical and artistic prowess, but if you love the manga, it is more than enough reason to give it a try.\n\n~~~img(https://thenullset.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/110407.jpg)~~~\n~~~*If you have watched this OVA and enjoyed it, then by all means do I recommend the manga.*~~~"}, {"id": 2870, "score": 48, "body": "Many anime fans hold studio Ghibli in revere. It would be no lie to say that Ghibli has played a large role in defining anime. But because of the massive success of studio Ghibli in becoming a household name, many fans view their films through rose tinted glasses of nostalgia and ignore fatal flaws.

I started reading the manga earlier last year, I think, and I remember finding it, while not a materpiece, enjoyable enough. A light, ecchi story with a bit of heart and comedy. This OVA, or at least the first part released ahead of the anime itself, is a departure from what I believe made the series enjoyable (the comedy) and doubled down on ecchi.\n\nThe first episode covers two separate storylines. The first is a get-to-know-the-cast story, and the second is a bit from the manga. Both exist solely to show the viewer \"dem anime tiddies.\" If that is all you want from this, then make hay; however, the barebone plot coupled with the poor animation quality (medium-distance scenes have the detail of long-distance in most other shows; there is not real detailing in the faces in close ups resulting in a very flat-feeling composition) make this OVA a turn-off to the series to the uninitiated. I know this series is better, but why would someone who has no contact with this series want to keep watching it based on this uninspired mess?\n\nMaybe, though, I'm wrong and the manga is bad, too. To be fair, the manga I was reading was censored. So, everything happened behind \"steam.\" I believe, in the complied releases of the manga, this was removed in favor of a more explicit rendering. Losing that varnish of mystique going from censored manga to this just leaves the series feeling crass and leaves a less familiarized viewer (with anime tropes writ large) feeling gross for watching it (the loli-in-appearance owner being visibly naked could be considered galling).\n\nI must acknowledge that this is supposed to be a released-with-the-manga product, so it makes sense that it is light on everything except fanservice, but it doesn't function as a hat-tip to the faithful reader. It presents itself as an introduction piece to the full-length anime upcoming, and, on those merits, it fails. There is nothing enticing about this except for the fanservice, something I believe will be \"steamier\" in the broadcast show, so if you're on-board for that only, expect to be disappointed.\n\nPerhaps I am being to harsh to what is ostensibly a little bonus piece of content, but it is so comically uninspired and so tactically being billeted right before the anime airs that harsh feels warranted. This is supposed to be the thing that gets you to tune in or buy the next thing. Instead, it is hapless predictable and woefully hollow. Just meeting this character? You're about to see her boobs. A lot. If you like that, give it a watch, though I'd recommend, if that is your goal, that you skip around and avoid having to watch the weak connective tissue pulling you from scene to scene.\n\nShould My Sister Watch This Anime?

And it's very boring. Because just like [another certain show also about a classroom](https://anilist.co/anime/98659/Classroom-of-the-Elite/), the show tries to be very dramatic and act as if the stuff happening matters, but it doesn't.\n\n\"You're out of money! Ha ha! Bet you can't do science things! You'll have to use your imagination and creativity to get out of this on--oh... you found a loophole in the contract. Wow! You solved the problem of the Classroom Crisis!\"\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/hbRph4h.png)\n\nI think the main plot, or what the main point of the show is supposed to be... is getting invested in these students and class. But almost all of them are basically just glorified extras. To the point where I honestly cannot even recall if any of their names were ever spoken throughout the entire show. Every single one of them, their character is just... they're the other students in the class. Main Girl 1, Main Girl 2, and Business Guy Main are literally the only students that ever matter throughout the entire show. But you can't have a series about a classroom of just three students.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/wfm8qkp.jpg)\n\nYet the problem is that on top of having all of these extras taking up screen time, the series actually acts as if they're real characters. Because early on when the Business Guy Main is still actively messing with the class in an attempt to get it shut down, a bunch of the other students become demoralized and quit the class and it's this very dramatic scene.

Even worse, when the students that quit \"come back\" one of them basically just straight up says that they were basically only PRETENDING to have quit the class.

It is sort of, but it's usually centered around the stupid worthless classroom of rocket scientists who are simultaneously idiots led by the largest idiot who is somehow their teacher.\n- The show could have been more about the Business Guy Main and... his eventual... and completely worthless romance with Main Girl 1 ~!(...and Main Girl 2)!~\n\nBy the way, you just gotta love __Charlotte's Law__. If there is a Main Male Character and a Main Female Character, then god damn it, they have to absolutely love each other by the end of show even if there is absolutely no motivation for either of them. Main Girl 1 herself only decides she loves Business Main Male after Main Girl 2 tells her that Main Girl 1 loves him. It literally came out of nowhere. Sure Main Girl 1 was certainly the nicest of the students towards Business Guy Main, but he was always either this asshole trying to shut down their classroom or just outright dismissive of her entirely.\n\nBut no! She loves him! Because the show needs romance.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/bo9U9jJ.jpg)\n\nIt's additionally frustrating in the case of Classroom Crisis because ~!there's an actual motivation for romance between Business Guy Main and Main Girl 2. So why not just have that be the actual main romance of the show rather than having Main Girl 1 and then... this weird... love triangle/harem thing?!~\n\nAll those paths... and this was the end result. A mostly boring bad show. Those shows are the ones I consider that have the least worth. The ones where you don't have a strong reaction positively OR negatively. Again, I think the main plot or main purpose of the show is getting invested in this classroom of characters and the four of those that actually matter in the show I've described so vividly in this review. Business Guy Main, Main Girl 1, Main Girl 2, and the Idiot Teacher. I'm _invested_ in these characters!\n\nAnd unfortunately, it's not really entertaining in a bad way either. Really, I was bored pretty much the entire way through. A show about space exploration and building rockets with political machinations going on behind the scenes in an attempt to thwart the scientists' effort... sounds amazing on paper! Unfortunately, the execution was just complete and utter shit.\n\nI mean, they only go out into space maybe three or four times throughout the entire show. The rest is almost entirely on terraformed Mars and unfortunately, it just looks like a regular Earth city with almost no distinctive features. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/j7vk3ul.png)\n\nBecause of course all of the locations where scenes happen at are always far away from the boundary of the terraform bubble that they're in. Are they on Mars? Because... they could just be on Earth and it wouldn't change the show a single bit. And when the episode following the episode where the class solves their budget problem by using a loophole just outright starts with the student characters at karaoke... I just knew I was in for a terrible time.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/hjoY7as.png)\n\nSo yeah, an overall nope on this one. A __5 out of 100__ as I view it as a complete and utter waste of time. They aimed for mediocrity, and yet they still missed. If you want a good show about space, I'm sure there's plenty out there. And if you want an entertainingly bad show... this isn't that either.\n\nIt's nothing.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/9DUPcSD.png)\n\n_Also, I didn't even mention that the twist of the entire show is_ ~!one of the characters' real name is in fact the same as another character's. I didn't feel like the plot was even worth going into, but boy that's some real bad writing. This super cool business guy character? Well, in actuality, he's nobody important! It's actually the girl! We just used him as her double solely because he had the same first name! THEY DON'T EVEN LOOK ALIKE. WHY WOULD YOU HAVE HIM ACT AS HER DOUBLE.!~\n"}, {"id": 2895, "score": 40, "body": "The first season of Tsubasa Chronicle was riddled with problems that bogged down an otherwise great show concept. Having an expanded universe of in-house creations across different worlds/dimensions is an exciting idea. Sadly, when coupled with mediocre animation, flat voice acting, and worst of all, one-off stories that don't go anywhere, it's hard to still justify that concept. The 2nd season promises more exciting and dangerous adventures and to possibly repair the mistakes of the past. But does it actually deliver on its promise? Personally, I have to disagree.\n\nWith the last major arc of the 1st season, we are left with a few unresolved questions. Who is the mysterious clone of Syaroan kept by Fei Wong? Will Syaroan's rival Seishiro come back to impede his progress? How many more memory feathers are there? What about the pasts and significance of Fai and Kurogane? There's a lot for this show to explain and cover in 26 episodes and yet it seems that the series seems more content dragging its feet than to hold its viewer's attention. More \"feather of the week\" episodes are abound in this season, many of them never relating back to the main questions at hand. The first 3 episodes are dedicated to a race with a feather as the prize. During the preliminaries, it is discovered someone is meddling with the race and causing the \"dragonfly\" cars to explode! Fast-paced action plus a dash of psychological insight would have made this a stellar beginning to the season. Instead, it's a slow watch as the race plays out predictably up until a nonsensical twist. You could say the same for many of the arcs in this season - they have an interesting premise, play out slow and predictably, then throw a random twist in there that's more confusing than entertaining. Considering the series has been quite straightforward thus far, I doubt it's anything that you need to think about - it's more or less a way so the story can start moving to the next world.\n\nWhat could be considered the most disappointing is that a rather large chunk of the season is filler! The first 17 episodes are more or less canon, while the last 9 are all originals. Are the original episodes at least a worthwhile watch? Normally I'd say no, but considering the material I've seen up until these episodes, I'd say stick with it if you like what you see. Most of the originals are bland like the one where Kero from Cardcaptor Sakura and Mokona meet, but some of them have some fairly interesting ideas. The one where they return to Koryo to meet Chu'nyan and enter a demon parallel world is decent for extended world building and the last arc in Tao Country with the ruler Chaos had a lot of good ideas. But I've said this before - this show is great with ideas but it doesn't know how to properly execute them. With a better studio or writing staff at the helm, it would've made for a great OVA. Instead, its underdeveloped and is more content being padding for a season than it is showing off the team's creative talents.\n\nAs curious as some of these originals are, it begs the question - why not adapt the manga portion for the last 9 episodes instead of coming up with originals?  There's a rather intriguing answer behind this. According to a comment made by a fan of the series, the show originally aired on a channel that was more educational and made for kids. A major arc in the series, the Tokyo arc, shows a lot of violence and gore(!) - rather than adapt this, they instead filled up the rest of the requested episodes with their own. There are many conclusions you can walk away with from this story - the studio weren't fully aware of the restrictions and they did it out of necessity, they wanted a kiddie series like Cardcaptor Sakura and instead they got something much more dark, etc. Whatever the case, everyone loses with the end result and the Tokyo arc could've showed off the strong potential the series has.\n\nSo does this season at least do anything better than the previous one? Gladly, it does! The biggest takeaway from this is Kurogane's backstory, in which we see a tale of a young swordsman hone his craft in a royal family only for tragedy to strike and scar him permanently. It's not as impactful as a solid \"wandering ronin\" tale, but it's a shining moment that the series desperately needed. Though Fai doesn't get any real backstory (again), an early one-off episode gives a small peak as to what it may be. Even without all the finer details, it still is a rather sweet story that shows off Fai's boyish charm. Though we don't get all the pieces to the puzzle, there's enough to help shape a better image of Syaroan and Sakura's partners.\n\nThe animation is still the same for the series, bland and second rate. It needs help from Bee Train's parent company, Production I.G., badly. Compare this to the flashiness the Birdcage movie had - it's a real disappointment. As a general rule of thumb, if your show is action oriented, shortcuts only hurt it overall. This wouldn't be as bad if the series were a slice of life but the cutaways during a critical scene and off-models really damage the appearance of the show. I will say that there seems to be more variety in the music, with a few more original songs. I take back what I said about the first season music-wise - the soundtrack to this anime is very good and helps save a few scenes with Yuki Kajiura's wonderful songwriting. The voice acting also seems a bit more lively this time - it's not perfect but it evokes more emotion than the stale delivery that haunted the first season.\n\nOverall, I give Tsubasa Chronicle 2nd Season a 4/10. Some series get better if you allow them the chance to shine. Other series are almost mandatory to watch in full - to quote a friend, \"you need to see the ending to understand the beginning\". Tsubasa Chronicle, at least from the anime adaptation, is neither of those. It is a series that comes close to achieving strength but poor circumstances deny it from being a series that's worth any investment. I can not recommend it.\n\nDo you like or dislike this anime? If you haven't watched it, are you encouraged to watch it or not? Leave a comment on my profile telling me what you think of the anime and/or my review.\n\nThanks for reading and have a blessed day!  "}, {"id": 2904, "score": 27, "body": "***Caution:*** This review contains spoilers for this predictable show. I have specifically and very clearly marked the spoiler sections (there aren't as many as you think, only 3 paragraphs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 worth) so you can still easily read my review and do not need to worry. As for the fans of the show, enter at your own volition since you will not find this review to exalt it in any manner, so to those who consider FranXX a 10/10, keep your temper in and let's begin. If you're a regular reader, please carry on :)\n\nFranXX was hyped a lot. And that's just the short of it, it had a huge marketing campaign and had a huge amount of anticipation with people calling it the \u00e2\u0080\u009cNext Evangelion\u00e2\u0080\u009d or a \u00e2\u0080\u009cSpiritual successor to Eva\u00e2\u0080\u009d and so on and so forth. The legendary Yabuki Kentarou was signed on doing the art for the manga adaptation for this unoriginal original and as a matter of fact, that's how I found out about the show in the first place and went in expecting the amazing show the marketing had me believe. Result? Well I can't surprise you since you might have seen the score I gave it. Yes. A mess. A terrible mess.\n\nTo begin with, the main part that is the reason fans gloss over this show, the characters. They are given little to no backstories and their roles to play are very less. Squad 13 mainly served as a bumbling group of teenagers (hmm\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 why teenagers in particular?) who don't know jackshit except for the so called \u00e2\u0080\u009cfact\u00e2\u0080\u009d that they must pilot the mechs known as FranXX and defeat these blue magma lover monsters called Klaxosaurs. Let that seep in. Why children? Most likely because they wanna appeal to the target audience of the show, teenagers. Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be as fruitful as A-1 and Trigger thought it would because when you've got an idiotic group of teenagers who contribute nothing to character development, I don't think you end up with teenage viewers going crazy over a show. I mean, yes, teens in real life aren't always smart, but if given the chance, I'm sure they'd do something sensible when they need to, but we don't see such a thing at all. Why? All we see is random blushes and such stuff. I mean, these teens are acting like everyday teens, yes, that's fine but is this the premise to do so? A place where people are bombarded by the constant threat of Klaxosaurs? Kids are supposed to have fun yes, but not when you're literally guarding human lives from danger. \n\n~~~img720(https://images5.alphacoders.com/896/896569.png)~~~\n\nTo move away from the characters for a moment, we move to another problem with the show, its connection. And don't you dare justify it by telling me it's an episodic anime, because it sure as hell is not. In reality, it's just mixed up completely and had too many ideas to implement together and instead of choosing one idea to go with, they probably chose all and excellently failed at all of them. Why? Poor connection. To hold up a plot you need connection, FranXX didn't offer any of that at all. It just dragged on and didn't leave any mention of what happened before and most importantly WHY the situation happened before. What could possibly be the reason behind this? Simple. Bad direction. All it takes to destroy the whole hard work of a show is bad direction. In fact, about 90% of the issues with the anime can be traced back to bad direction. If the show had a good director I suppose the show would have a direction to follow, but this being FranXX, it had to follow all the directions it could and then ended up nowhere. In the first episode I had the show at a shocking 9 and if you look at it now it's fallen pretty spectacularly. This is because of the show's bad direction; events were unconnected and an irritated yours truly almost smashed his screen onto the floor . Random stuff happening here with no explanation, and then random stuff happening there without explanation, was this anime devoid of sense or something? Because I did not find any of it anywhere. And then we've got the problem that follows that the story was unexplained. Why did this happen? Why did that happen? How did this occur? Where did this issue first occur? There were many questions asked by fans, and the answer is that it was clear both studios didn't want quality, they wanted the $$$ And that's me trying to be positive, we got zilch as in reality but eh, gotta act positive. \n\nNeedless to say, apart from a cliched mess of a story, it's disappointing in almost every other regard (read on for further explanation), serving as a reminder that it only takes one big mistake to spoil the whole effort put into an anime, or anything for that matter. Speaking of mistakes, we come to another part that had the cosplayers, fan artists and others crazy, the romance\u00e2\u0080\u0094 particularly the romance between Zero Two and Hiro. First off, our two MCs. Zero Two was introduced as a waifu like character which immediately took the undeserving \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeconstruction\u00e2\u0080\u009d tag which was ripped off from Eva (surprise surprise, FranXX ripped off a show) while giving us another useless MC who went by the self appointed name Hiro. Their romance was unexplained until way later into the series, an episode which even I liked, episode 13. They were largely unexplained for most of the anime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s run and it was only in the first episode of the second cour (episode 13) that tried to remedy this. Result? Thankfully good. Episode 13 was regarded as an excellent episode by even the harshest of critics since it explained a lot of the stuff between Hiro and Zero Two and obviously it was a flashback episode, yet despite being a flashback episode it was done well\u00e2\u0080\u0094 surprising since this is FranXX. But the problem came afterwards; after that episode was done, we saw a lot of crap follow it in the form of the team getting \u00e2\u0080\u009cmad\u00e2\u0080\u009d at Zero Two for \u00e2\u0080\u009churting\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hiro for over dramatic effect and to make me sympathise with the characters. Why would you drag through 12 episodes just to see the one episode that seemed half decent and it goes back to its shitty formula? I loathed it even more.The episodes were cliched, unconnected messes with absolutely no relevance to the plot, just serving to pass time either to focus on Hiro or to make the fanboys go crazy over the fight scenes, which were nothing more than one hit kills and random dashes.\n\nMoving on from there all we got were cheesy half hearted lines like \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wanna be with you forever\u00e2\u0080\u009d and all that teenage fantasy (severely paraphrased for ease of comprehensive analysis) and pointless romantic moments that don't have much to do with the plot. Why am I crushing the romance here even though I'm a romance fan? It's because FranXX deployed this romance at the wrong times, I can't even say I'm surprised anymore at this kind of problem. Then we go to the other cast, Ichigo is a character that served as a reminder about the stupidity of fanboys since her voice actor Kana Ichinose received death threats just because of her work as Ichigo. Anno would be proud. Ichigo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character though wasn't fleshed out (to say nothing of the rest of the cast, especially Ikuno, Zorome and Miku) and her actions were basically \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm jealous because I love him but can't reveal it to him because I'm shy\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that time when she DID do it, it was enough to even send non romance fans into a fit because it was done in a (dare I say it?) slutty way cause teenagers? I do not know. Then we come to the signature part which had many people divided as well, Kokoro. To delve into this horrible character we must enter minor spoiler territory so if you can't handle looking at a good character being turned into a whore please skip the marked spoiler section. \n\n~~~img720(https://images2.alphacoders.com/901/901307.png)~~~\n\n***Skip this paragraph if you don't want spoilers about this side character and want the relationship as a surprise. Spoilers begin: Kokoro was paired up with Futoshi who liked Kokoro a lot but suffered from the same problem as Ichigo. However, since he's male the fanboys didn't take or notice much issue, perhaps also because Futoshi wasn't made as a cockblocker character and instead was of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll protect her\u00e2\u0080\u009d than a \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want him to love me instead\u00e2\u0080\u009d, only thing is that Kokoro turned out to \u00e2\u0080\u009cbetray\u00e2\u0080\u009d Futoshi and instead go for an unlikely character who was largely ignored throughout the show, Mitsuru. She suddenly developed feelings for him and even kissed him for no concrete reason apart from taking the show into an extremely shitty direction because guess what? She wanted a baby. Why? Freakin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 teenagers\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 this is the worst way to relate to them. Then Kokoro went from a \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not in love with Futoshi but he's a kind person\u00e2\u0080\u009d to an \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want Mitsuru\u00e2\u0080\u0099s @#$_ inside me\". I'm not even joking. This LITERALLY happened. Why am I rambling on about this? Because that's definitely not how you make a show about teenagers because that's not at all representative of the majority. Anyway, then they suddenly want to get married (!?) and we see other crap follow as well without explanation or reason, they just wanna fill time at this rate. With what? Throwing in the notion that Kokoro is pregnant later on. Teenage pregnancy, a very common thing in teens nowadays amiright? Wrong. And you know what worse? The fact that the folks at FranXX.inc pulled the WORST cliche to go with this. Both of them are caught and are \u00e2\u0080\u009cbrainwashed\u00e2\u0080\u009d and their memories are \u00e2\u0080\u009cstored\u00e2\u0080\u009d somewhere. If VIRM didn't want to let them regain their memories then why store them in the first place? Why not \u00e2\u0080\u009cdelete\u00e2\u0080\u009d them into oblivion? Plot armour I say. Convenience too\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 this makes many viewers realise that the episode was just existing to pass time and fool the viewers into thinking their time into the episode was worth it?  Spoiler end***\n\nThis brings us on to the next point, underused characters. Namely Miku, Zorome and Ikuno. Not to mention Goro but he got a little bit of a focus so I'll give him a brief look later. Miku and Zorome were shown as characters who had a rivalry-love which seemed fresh and interesting but that was pulled down along with the anime because they didn't focus on these two at all. What made them attracted to each other? Why are they paired up together? These questions were never answered and I was left hanging, which was disappointing since Miku apart from sharing the same hairstyle as the superstar with the same name (my profile picture character to those of you non-Vocaloid fans) she was one of the few characters who was believable as a teenager. Many people wouldn't notice that these two weren't given enough focus and that was sad because this fresh idea could be explored a lot more and I wouldn't be surprised if I found their rivalry-love better than the two main characters, and don't forget, I liked Miku as a character as well. \n\nLeaving us with the last two, Ikuno and Goro. Ikuno was mainly used as fodder for Mitsuru to frown upon so that he could get hooked to the resident slut Kokoro (I don't think I should call her that because she didn't like Futoshi but considered him kind but then I'm disappointed because like Miku, I liked Kokoro, only that love turned to hate since FranXX ruined her) and Ikuno was ignored for the rest of the anime, she wasn't given lines and that one \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want a baby\u00e2\u0080\u009d episode scene where she DID say something, it wasn't explained WHY she stepped forward and did her act. My guess is because since she didn't have any lines, the show didn't want to make her look like a dumbass so they forcefully gave her lines and that was all. Then we enter spoiler territory yet again because Ikuno was given that small 5 minute focus in a later episode. \n\n~~~img720(https://images2.alphacoders.com/915/915661.jpg)~~~\n\n***Minor Spoiler Begin: Since Ikuno wasn't given a love interest the folks at FranXX.inc thought it's a good idea to introduce some Yuri at the worst possible time and in the worst possible way, as such, the result was never spoken of again, which pretty much explains how the \u00e2\u0080\u009caffair\u00e2\u0080\u009d went. Needless to say, this was a last ditch effort to save her character and it served as the final nail in the coffin for Ikuno. Minor Spoiler End*** \n\nWe then come to the last character, Goro. Apart from being mildly explored, he served as the third wheel-ish character who was later shown as being in love with Ichigo unsurprisingly, unfortunately he as mentioned wasn't explored much and so was thrown into the sidelines to focus on our main characters, yet another character thrown aside who had a lot of potential to do great things in this mess of an anime. I haven't spoken of any \u00e2\u0080\u009cvillains\u00e2\u0080\u009d yet, as this important role was destroyed by the Iotas, who were, like every other thing in the anime, unexplained, unwanted and irrelevant. They served as somewhat of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbackstory\u00e2\u0080\u009d to Zero Two despite not going into detail at all. \n\nAs mentioned above there was no proper backstory to Squad 13. Some people said it's because sci-fi shows \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon't need backstories\u00e2\u0080\u009d. This is plain wrong because if you don't have backstories of your character, there won't be any depth to them (see the word depth again and imagine, if there's no backstory, there's no depth, which means the characters are shallow) and when the characters simply don't develop at all during the course of the anime, you end up with flat characters who fall on their face to the plot. Why am I saying this? Hiro and the others didn't change at all mentally from the first episode to the last. Some might say Hiro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s infatuation with 02 makes him a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeveloped character\u00e2\u0080\u009d but his rejection of his other members in Squad 13 proves that wrong. Others say that \u00e2\u0080\u009ccharacterisation is excused in a sci-fi anime\u00e2\u0080\u009d. At first it seemed as a joke to me but when people seriously started talking about this as a defense I got concerned and felt I needed to clarify this. Take arguably the best sci-fi show as an example to that statement: Steins;Gate. It definitely has development throughout the series. How? Okabe starts to realise he can't do anything, and tries even harder, Makise realises she can't do things alone, Mayuri does more tuturus because people around her are sad, or to move from the joke, Mayuri realises that she needs Okabe and he needs her, this is what development in a sci-fi is. FranXX, on the other hand, didn't have any development to the show, its characters, or anything. It felt more like characters felt less real each time they appeared, and I'm not talking about them being realistic and human-like since that's not what an anime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main target is everytime, I'm talking about them being acceptable as a character which wasn't at all seen. No characterisation is only excused in slice of life anime since we're understandably looking at the lives of the characters and so there's no plot and therefore no development. FranXX isn't a slice of life, it's (terribly weak) progression proved that.\n\n~~~img720(https://images.alphacoders.com/908/908032.jpg)~~~\n\nMoving back to the MC of our wonderful series, Hiro. I hadn't given him enough attention and will do so now. From the start he was unexplained. Why was he a prodigy? What was he doing before meeting Zero Two? What made him so special? To stand out from the rest of the cast, you need distinctive qualities that set you apart from other characters, Hiro had none of that. He was plain and boring. Many may point out that him being in love with 02 would mean that it makes him different from other MCs but that's wrong because apart from his \u00e2\u0080\u009clove\u00e2\u0080\u009d for 02, nothing else was brought into his character. Although towards the end it was shown that he had become selfish and cared about 02 more than his squad who cared about him, it still isn't the kind of development that makes you go \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, that changed my view of him positively\u00e2\u0080\u009d and if you read that line again you'll probably understand why too. Then we come to the point that he named everyone else, which was revealed early on. This surprisingly is a good thing I saw. He named Ichigo and named other parasites as well which gave it a child-like feeling (perhaps the only successful child-like/teenage feeling that was executed properly throughout the anime, bear in mind this flashback was 2 minutes long) although it wasn't explained at all I still felt an iota of warmth. And nothing else I suppose.\n\nGoing back to the other \u00e2\u0080\u009cvillains\u00e2\u0080\u009d, the Iotas. Since they came in at random times and with random half baked reasons, unsurprisingly they served as yet another thing that was meant to be loathed in the anime. Another irritating thing is how they suddenly became buddy-buddy with Hiro and team in the final arc. I suppose now that FranXX has exhausted whatever little \u00e2\u0080\u009ccreativity\u00e2\u0080\u009d they had, they wanted to end with a shounen-esque \u00e2\u0080\u009ceveryone bands together to fight the enemy\u00e2\u0080\u009d? I mean, not complaining about the trope but was there any sensible stuff going on beforehand? Speaking of insane stuff going on beforehand, FranXX was said to have been in a post apocalyptic world all of a sudden which we were given hints of in the beach episode for about 20 seconds and then later shown in \u00e2\u0080\u009cdetail\u00e2\u0080\u009d (I don't even know why I'm so generously awarding that word when it's meaning wasn't followed at all) in episode 19, which to FranXX\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favour, was a decent episode. But until then for the first 18 episodes, it remained largely unexplained and I don't think I can award a show a point for revealing something so important when it's finished about 80% of it's run. Not a good practice and it returns more harm than good which by now is definitely not what I need to calm myself down. Oh youth. But then wait! Youth reminds me that I should yet again cover another important part about the \u00e2\u0080\u009cjuvenile\u00e2\u0080\u009d aspect of this show. \n\nSpoiler Paragraph (or Spoiler-graph) for the final arc below. Skip this paragraph if you don't want spoilers for the final arc. If you're okay with them, then please continue :)\n\n***Spoiler for last arc begin: The most frustrating part of FranXX is by far the last arc. After pointless teenage melodrama, the FranXX team thought of what \u00e2\u0080\u009cideas\u00e2\u0080\u009d can be added to \u00e2\u0080\u009csave\u00e2\u0080\u009d the anime and they did what every laughable show tries to do as a last ditch effort. To take the battle into (wait for it) SPAAAAAACEEEEEE. Yes. FranXX pulled THAT trope. What an insult to Star Wars and Star Trek. Anyway back to this show, the sudden shift in tones (first a teenage melodrama, then a clone war, then a space war? Is this a tutorial on how NOT to make Star Wars ripoffs?) and extremely convenient and unexplained reveals (more on that in a bit) coming out of nowhere? I don't think that makes for a coherent plot at all. Add to that another desperate added shounen trope where the enemy suddenly becomes your friend??? And he sacrifices his life for you just a while after you rescue him??? The Klaxosaur Princess was set as the antagonist at around the third quarter of the show and she suddenly joined Hiro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side and sacrificed her life for him? What happened to her people, the Klaxosaurs? What happened to saving the world? And then suddenly VIRM puts themselves as the villains despite the show trying to establish the Klaxosaurs as the villains and then the aforementioned Klaxosaur Princess as an antagonist? And then their boss is a Power Rangers ripoff??? What even was that last arc?! The industry can do without more Dadolf Scmitlers you know! We've seen enough of this trope! Like when they're losing Papa and the others suddenly give the order to destroy Earth? Nanja sorya??? And then if you thought all this stupidity wasn't enough, we suddenly see YET ANOTHER problem with the show surface, Plot armour. If I hadn't explained this before, FranXX suffered from yet another plot hole in the form of plot armour. The Iotas lost a few of their members but Hiro and team were left unscathed, the only \u00e2\u0080\u009cinjury\u00e2\u0080\u009d being Ikuno\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hair being turned white\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Throughout the course of the show Squad 13 was met with life or death situations but I was confused since no one died. It can't be a life or death situation if everyone survives, or at least when you have so many life or death situations and no one dies even once I think that's authentically bullshit. Why fill it to the brim with Deus Ex Machina crap then? In the last 3 episodes we saw Hiro and team suddenly band together and go to space, but then the pathetic dialogue in the previous episodes of the anime became even worse, when they're in space they're going \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe're really in space huh?\u00e2\u0080\u009d And Mitsuru\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reason for staying being \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wanna stay because I want to\u00e2\u0080\u009d? Even the dialogues took a huge hit and fell even further\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Add to that the pointless Mobile Suit Gundam I ripoff battle except FranXX\u00e2\u0080\u0099s was much worse because everyone survived??? Not to mention Zero Two eating Hiro through her teleport to Hiro fro Earth directly in front of Hiro and she eats him and takes him to the dream world only to play hard to get? If you're not understanding at all then you have common sense, because no sensible person could understand WHAT happened and WHY. Let's not add to that horrible reasons to horrible dialogues such as bringing up love when your Squadmate is suffering? And then Hiro and Zero Two immediately go leave the Solar System and the others can't tag along because \u00e2\u0080\u009cit's not possible\u00e2\u0080\u009d? This is the limit of cliches but the studios broke it long long ago. And I want to skip over that last episode since that was the only (remotely) decent (?) part of this arc, but the means done to achieve it wasn't and I spoke enough on that...

But you know what they say, if you've got no issues, you make them, and that's EXACTLY what FranXX stayed true to. Trying to show us that our teenage cast is \u00e2\u0080\u009cgrowing\u00e2\u0080\u009d by acting \u00e2\u0080\u009cmature\u00e2\u0080\u009d with examples as \u00e2\u0080\u009c wanting to have babies\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cdoing the kitty\u00e2\u0080\u009d (don't search up on that last one) both of which are related and were attempted by Kokoro and Mitsuru. Yet again you ask. Why? I do not know why the show did it. You can't even tell anymore who they're trying to make the show relatable for. Then we have to look at the teenage drama as well that follows (that I covered above). \n\nSpoiler Paragraph (or Spoiler-graph) about a range of questions on things that were unanswered throughout the course of the anime below. Skip this paragraph if you don't want spoilers on these questions. If you're okay with them, then as expected, read on.\n\n***Spoiler questions begin: FranXX as mentioned tried very very hard to be edgy by leaving out some so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cmystery\u00e2\u0080\u009d feel by not answering the most crucial questions many had throughout the course of the anime. Although episode 13 answered the questions many people had in the first half, there was no such plausible explanation for the second half\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stupidity. What makes me say that? We got weak explanations or no explanations. For example why was the enemy VIRM all along? What was their purpose? Why does Hiro not care about the rest of Squad 13 who he's lived with all his life and why is he so attached to Zero Two despite the above problem? Why are the problems for the characters happening? Who is to blame and why? Despite this being answered (VIRM) there was no proper explanation as to WHY the villains did it? What was their purpose? Why is Ichigo the leader of the group? Why is 02 not explained properly? How does she looks human and how did it happen (also why does she have pink hair when she was a clone of one with white or blue hair)? How are the rejected people treated? What happens to them? What about their memories? Although their memories as mentioned were stored in some place there's no explanation as to why they're stored. Why am I asking that question? When VIRM doesn't want their puppets to regain their memory, why store their memory? And how is the memory stored anyway? Why are teens chosen to pilot the FranXX? Don't tell me it's because their sex organs are most prominent because the teenage years is not the age when this is so. Why are pregnant girls not able to pilot the FranXX? How did the Iotas suddenly be able to join Hiro in the last arc? Weren't they broken or something? Why do Hiro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s group care and still chase Hiro despite him having rejected them for his \u00e2\u0080\u009cone true love\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zero Two? What was the bullcrap about them going to space and space being the important stuff? Like, what was that cop out explanation about VIRM and the enemies being the aliens? Who and what was the Klaxosaur Princess? Who were the Klaxosaurs? No detailed explanations were given. To cover the villains one last time, VIRM. We look again at the Dadolf Scmitler trope that FranXX.inc deployed. To viewers of Grancrest Senki who aren't familiar with the Dadolf Scmitler trope, VIRM is basically the Mage Academy, for the first 20 Episodes we were focused on only one villain but suddenly that villain changes in around the 20th episode and they tell us the real villains were someone else all along? (Surprising how both shows deploy the same cliche in the same episode number. Coincidence? I think not), Why is this bad? This is bad because it makes the viewer question if the time they spent on the first 20 episodes even worth it. I mean, if you really HAD to do this, why do it so late? And instead, why not just make an OVA of the last 6-8 episodes and treat it as the same thing? I'm sure it would get a higher score from me and other disgruntled people if they did this instead because our time was wasted\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Spoiler questions end***\n\n~~~img720(https://pm1.narvii.com/6728/90e5386006429c64a1d6082af45a181d406e3763v2_hq.jpg)~~~\n\nWith all that's said, eagle eyed readers might have noticed that I haven't trashed the art or the music. That's because it isn't shit. And continue to find out. Since it was a collaboration project with A-1 and Trigger (and later Cloverworks because budget issues?) many expected the art to look amazing and it did actually. They tried to make a world that looked beautiful and mostly succeeded in doing that but you can't award points to a show for \u00e2\u0080\u009clooking good\u00e2\u0080\u009d as with what the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmainstream\u00e2\u0080\u009d gaming critics like IGN often do (\u00e2\u0080\u009cCoD a 9/10 because it looks good?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Have you even seen what they're doing now ripping off Fortnite?) so though the art looked good thanks to the colourful backgrounds and eye-catching scenery from time to time, it was in vain as the show couldn't manage to utilise it well into its plot. Another thing that the show did good was the sound. Even though I've been (rightfully) trashing the show left and right, I have to give credit where it's due, FranXX\u00e2\u0080\u0099s usage of synth tracks are rarely seen in anime and obviously serve for something really good in terms of listening especially when you're using headphones (and not streaming the show). Then we move onto the OP/EDs selection, I felt that the show went lazy and just changed the OP a bit and passed it off as an OP 2, but the EDs were great. If only FranXX used those EDs more in the second half and don't abruptly end the episode I'd have a positive opinion of the show. But I'm guilty of singing \u00e2\u0080\u009cTorikago\u00e2\u0080\u009d from the show so gotta give a point to that I guess? But oh wait, they underused all the EDs anyway.\n\nOverall, FranXX is a mess which was over hyped and tried it's best to stay relevant by throwing in useless storylines all of which were riddled by plot holes and Deus ex machinas which were unconnected and not to mention completely unrelated events and random crap here and there (from teenage drama to Star Wars to Power Rangers? MASAKA???), to remain positive, towards the end, I only ever found the two caretakers Hachi and Nana (especially Nana) interesting and likeable since they had an aura of mystery and the 30 seconds they appeared in their few episodes were all great. Miku and Goro too were characters I pretty much liked but weren't explored well since they were thrown aside for Hiro and Zero Two unfortunately. If the show had good direction, I'm sure it would have turned out to be one of my favourite anime of all time and for many other disillusioned fans-turned-critics as well. FranXX sadly will always serve as a reminder to how one big mistake in the form of bad directing can jeopardize the whole premise of a show.\n\nSpecial thanks to TheCobraSlayer for proof-reading the review.\n\n~~~img1080(https://images2.alphacoders.com/901/901312.png)~~~\n\nStory: 0.5\nAnimation: 5\nSound: 5.5\nCharacter: 1\nEnjoyment: 1.5\n\nOverall: 2.7"}, {"id": 2906, "score": 30, "body": "Wasted potential, an all around mess. Its this show, Darling in the Franxx. Darling in the franxx takes place in the post apocalyptic distant future, where these humongous half robot half lizard like beasts called Klaxosaurs are wreaking havoc on the last of humanity. Humanity has been pushed into these small bio-domes, called plantations. To combat these Kalxosaurs, the humans use their technology to engineer giant robots of their own, called Franxx, using children born and raised to pilot them. These children are called parasites, and their one purpose in life is to pilot the Franxx in boy girl pairs and protect humanity. Hiro is one of these parasites, and the protagonist of the story. Upon his graduation, finally allowing him to pilot a Franxx, he feels a lack of confidence and runs to the nearby forest. In that forest, Hiro meets a strange pink haired girl with horns, who calls herself Zero Two. Zero Two is also a parasite, with an infamous record. She has been known for killing her partners when in a franxx. Suddenly, a Klaxosaur attacks and Zero Two invites Hiro to fight with her. Shaken by the attack, he obliges and they beat the Klaxosaur easily. Now they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re partners.\n\tThis show was first met with a ton of hype. And this continued throughout the entirety of the show. Darling in the Franxx is the newest product from Trigger. This time, they partnered with A1 pictures to make this thing. During Darling in the Franxx\u00e2\u0080\u0099s airing, it had easily built a very committed, very large community. Unfortunately, this community has a list of mistakes and examples of toxicity behind it. The biggest and most prominent one being the various death threats being thrown at the staff behind the show. This uproar was due to an unfortunate plot point that happened between some various characters. Darling in the Franxx\u00e2\u0080\u0099s genres include Action, Drama, Mecha, Romance, and Sci-Fi. The first mecha anime that has been hyped to this level in a while.\n\tDarling in the Franxx honestly started well. We were getting introduced to this amazing world with beautiful music, and some awesome robot fights with oh so fluid animation. We were introduced with an intriguing story and interesting characters at first. Emphasis being, at first. First 10 or so episodes, everything was going well, dips in animation quality here and there, but thats excusable. But by episode 10-12 finished, the entire show slowed to a halt. There were barely and Franxx v Klaxosaur fights like what we saw in the first dozen or so episodes. In the next 10 or so episodes, the Darling in the Franxx, explained how a lot of the characters and supporting cast. And this, was not very interesting at all and honestly generic. What those episode did was focus on characters that I have no interest in, and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care about at all. This was when the show became irredeemable to me. A lot of the community was still loving it though, even if there was a split in the various \u00e2\u0080\u009cbest girls\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the show. There was some less than stellar world building, as explained further by your Mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Basement. But then the late game rolled around. And there was a plot point, that was just so inexcusable, so unnecessary, so confusing, and just oh so bullshit that it makes me mad even when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m writing this. For the last 4 episodes, nothing was good about this show. \n\tFrom the beginning, Darling in the Franxx went on a downward slope. With its shitty community defending the show to death, god awful pacing, and just terrible plot points with no previous warning to. It started really well, if only it ended on a high note by its first arc. That being said the technical parts of the show are very good. Animation is by Trigger and it shows and with a lot of budget from AI Trigger was able to make the most of everything they had. The art and character designs are great and recognizable, even if the characters are not. Music can be honestly great and hype sometimes, mainly during the battle scenes that barely happen. But, again, the actual content in the show has made Darling in the Franxx the absolute worst mistake of an anime that Trigger has ever made. I recommend this show for people who want to see some aesthetically pretty, ambitious garbage. Or to watch the descent like I have. I give this show a 3 out of 10. This has been PixEFit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spoiler free, but not really review on Darling in the Franxx."}, {"id": 2907, "score": 45, "body": "Firstly, do I recommend No.06? In a word, __no__.\n\nWith that out of the way, let me explain why this show isn't worth your time with a list:\n\n- Bone simple characters\n- Forgettable side characters in general\n- Lazy world building\n- Weak overarching plot\n\nNo.06 takes place in your typical \"1984\" dystopian future where the government controls every aspect of life. I myself am a sucker for this type of setting with 'A Brave New World' being a particular favorite of mine. Speaking of which, No.06 is basically 'A Brave New World' and '1984' rolled together, but with boy-love thrown into the mix. The main character is a handome male youth named Shion. One day, Shion meets a strange outsider of society named Nezumi who also happens to be a handsome male youth, they instantly bond over their shared youthful handsomeness. Sadly for Shion, Nezumi departs and leaves him with the government's Thought Police on his doorstep.\n\nSeveral years pass in the story and Shion is now living in a favela outside of the city having been kicked out of the 'utopia'. There is now a unexplained bee plague that has popped up and is now terrorizing random people by rapidly aging them. Shion, having learned of the plague is kidnapped by the Ministry of Love, but is then rescued by Nezumi who has returned. Together the two handsome youthful heroes decide to find the source of the plague against the Ministry of Truth's wishes. Also, it's revealed that Shion has the plague, but doesn't instantly die like everybody else for some reason.\n\nThere you have it, a summary of the first two episodes of No.06. No, you did not misread that, ____two____ episodes. This entire show is eleven episodes long. Perhaps I should have mentioned that No.06 is based on the light novel series of the same name by Atsuko Asano, which itself totaled nine volumes. Nine volumes, eleven twenty-three minute episodes, that adds up to an entire novel for every twenty-eight minutes of animation. It is no wonder that the characters, plot, and world building are so watered down and poorly executed here. Unfortunately the story goes rapidly downhill with too many characters being introduced and then disappearing immediately afterwards with no explaination or closure with a shoddy crap-shoot ending to cap it all off. If you are familliar with false-utopia sci-fi novels, then you can probably tell how this story will end right from the get-go, it's got all the tropes.\n\nI have to admit, it has been a while since I watched No.06. I seem to remember the environments and backgrounds looking pretty and animation in general being well done. Character designs are above average and are well executed in motion and long-shots as well. Sound is hard to remember, so I'll put that down as forgettable. Overall dispite having a million things happening every episode, you end up forgetting all of it because the characters are paper-thin and the pacing is insane.\n\nArt - 6.5\nSound - 5\nStory - 3\nEnjoyment - 4.5\n\nWatch 'From the New World' instead. It's got a similar false-utopia setting, but it has its own identity and will keep you hooked from beginning to end.\n"}, {"id": 2919, "score": 5, "body": "~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/5coqO5w.png)~~~\n\nGurazeni is a thrilling and no holds barred struggle for survival as the protagonist Bonda Natsunouske engages all out war as the pitcher of the Spiders.

That's...\n\n_Can't I just review [One Outs](https://anilist.co/anime/5040/One-Outs/) instead? Come on._\n___\n\n#Failure Pitch#\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/aahxgk7.png)\n\nI guess we're really doing this. Right away I just have to state that Gurazeni was __a complete and utter waste of time__ (brought to us by [Studio DEEN](https://anilist.co/studio/37/Studio-DEEN)). As a sports series, there's no clear or set goal through the entire thing. We're never given like an idea of what point in their season they're in, so basically there never feels like a point to any of the games. It's just one after another. And Bonda never improves throughout the entire thing. To be fair in that respect, there ARE three different Gurazeni manga series apparently, but with what this anime has given us in the span of twelve episodes, I have absolutely no interest or desire in seeing where this goes.\n\nNot to mention there are multiple episodes where it's not even about Bonda. Which I wouldn't have a problem with if they were actually building up the team.  But despite entire episodes being about Bonda's teammates or even one of the goddamned commentators (_WHO GIVES A FUCK ABOUT THE COMMENTATOR_), all of the Spiders excluding Bonda may as well have been nameless and faceless. Even the ones the show spent time on were completely forgettable.\n\n...I'm getting ahead of myself here. We can't skirt past the elephant in the room. The Anilist and MAL descriptions of this show are as follows:\n\n#ANILIST#\n> The \"baseball money survival\" story focuses on a baseball team that operates as a highly-stratified society, where the player's performance determines his annual salary. The story follows an eight-year relief pitcher with an odd left-handed side-arm throw as he fights to survive under the team's strict system.\n\n#MAL#\n> This is the story of Natsunosuke Honda, a pro baseball player\u00e2\u0080\u0094a relief pitcher who has been playing pro in a team called Spiders for 8 years. The team operates as a highly-stratified society, where the player's performance determines his annual salary. Natsunosuke is one of the highest paid players in the game. He measures how good players are by how much money they make, and he intends to be on top and stay there, and as such is always looking for players to challenge and does everything to insure that he is better than they are.\n\nI've seen it described as \"baseball money survival\" elsewhere as well. Also, I just want to make a quick note on the MAL description: Natsunosuke is FAR from the highest paid players in the show. Like if anything he's like average or towards BELOW AVERAGE. Like holy shit, I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO SEE THE VERSION THE MAL DESCRIPTION IS DESCRIBING. But no, he never improves, and he never gets his salary raised beyond his starting 18 million yen per year.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/7NHJxr9.png)\n\nTo further stretch the blatant attempt to try and sell this as One Outs, they even got the [same guy](https://anilist.co/staff/123981/Hideo-Takayashiki) who did One Outs' script for Gurazeni. And I... don't know why. I guess probably just because both are baseball series. There is absolutely no survival element or gambling element or any stakes to this series in what this season gave us WHATSOEVER. All Bonda does is just ramble on and on about other players' contracts, and the constant and unending narration almost immediately got old and made me hate Bonda.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/zxUiQws.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/mmNm1G8.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/AR9vCZw.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/ZS7xiNW.png)~~~\n\n\"This guy makes this much! That guy makes that much! This guy is worth literally ten of me! Ten entire Bonda's! Wow!\"\n\nNobody. And I mean, \n\n#___NOBODY___# \n\ngives a flying fuck about the players' contracts unless it's like crazy over the top like the one One Outs is centered around. __I would rather fucking see an entire series about the people who maintain and prepare the goddamned FIELD than a guy just rambling on internally about how much more the other players make than him.__ Even Gurazeni itself shows that the contracts don't matter, as even goddamned worthless Bonda can still sometimes triumph over the guy who makes five times or however much as him. Bonda even says it himself that him thinking this way is stupid or silly _YET HE STILL DOES IT._\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/D9rtXP3.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/mZO9pxa.png)~~~\n\n\"Oh wow. It's almost like my contract being smaller than this didn't necessarily guarantee that I would lose to him. It's almost like there are factors much more important that determine a player's skill other than THEIR GODDAMNED BANK ACCOUNTS.\"\n\n...And it was borderline embarrassing when the fifth episode was just an episode about a manga artist starts going to the Spiders' games because he wants to do a baseball series about an average relief pitcher. So... the manga artist character in Gurazeni wants to make... Gurazeni? Wow, how masturbatory. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/neLtNKI.png)\n\nLike wow what a wonderful idea, a sport series about a dull average character who not only cares about money, but the amount of money OTHER people are making. Wow, what a great series to get people interested in the sport of baseball!\n\nWhat else was there to mention? Oh yeah. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/ySZ9fFL.png)\n\nYou can't have a sport series without at least one female character, right? There's gotta be at least one in there. Well, we see Gurazeni's right away in the OP like three times. Then, the entire ED is just her, and I think it's her singing the ED as well. You may be wondering, well, when is she actually introduced though? She's throughout the OP and she's the entire ED... so surely, she's a supporting character, right? But I'm on like episode three and there's been no sighting of her whatsoever...\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/cyMpSd1.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/OCYS8p7.png)~~~\n\n...She's introduced episode 12. The very final episode of Gurazeni. The entire episode is about her going to a Spiders game, rooting for the other team, and then hating the absolute shit out of Bonda. Her and Bonda barely interact and she does not recognize him as a professional baseball player because of how absolutely average he is. Really, the entire purpose of her episode is to establish that Bonda in fact has a love interest. Said love interest is just completely unaware of him. Like literally does not know who he is apart from some other customer that comes to the diner and unbeknownst to her, is constantly staring at her from afar.\n\n_But... but in the ED, she's shown to be wearing a Spiders cap though. She appears multiple times in the OP! SHE'S IN THE GODDAMNED COVER IMAGE. I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE A SINGLE SUPPORTING CHARACTER THAT MATTERED._\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/wa1zhYP.png)\n\n_LET ME DANCE WITH YOUR SHADOW MONSTER TONI--wait shadow monster? WHAT THE FUCK IS A SHADOW MONSTER. WHY IS THE ED FOR THIS BASEBALL SERIES REFERENCING SHADOW MONSTERS._\n\nYes well, we'll probably have to wait until the fourth season of Gurazeni for her to even make the realization who Bonda even is. That is to say if she even appears in other parts of Gurazeni. I'm just kind of giving this series that little credit and assuming she is. And I probably shouldn't, because like every character a single episode focuses on, they either never appear again in another episode or are just complete bit players. As a matter of fact, I think the only character I can remember seeing again after an episode focused on them was the commentator guy.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/zI39ucV.jpg)\n\n...I feel like bringing up the terrible CG and the fact that the actual baseball scenes are usually a slog to watch is basically shoveling dirt onto the coffin of this show. Like the shoddy and cheap animation kind of fucking pales in comparison to the fact that at multiple points this show felt insulting to the sport of baseball itself. There's an episode where like the managers of a team that the Spiders are playing against want their old fan favorite player to lose against Bonda because they want him to retire because his contract is costing them too much money.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/eS9conx.png)\n\nAnd I guess like it's supposed to be funny but... that's terrible? You would rather your whole team to lose and the fans' favorite player completely retire rather than just renegotiate his contract. Like in One Outs, the whole thing is the owner of the team wants the star player to do terrible because they agreed on an insane and ridiculous contract. But in One Outs, the team owner is an over the top villainous asshole.\n\nAgain, wow. I can really feel the spirit of baseball in this series. \"This old bastard is costing us too much money and therefore is preventing us from hiring some new young players with potential! ___WE NEED HIM TO RETIRE RIGHT AWAY.___\"\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/0mlR6cU.png)\n\n___\n\n#A Foregone Conclusion#\n\n...If we take masochism off of the table, there's absolutely no situation in which I would ever recommend anybody watch Gurazeni. Like the fact that they tried to sell this as One Outs is fucking baffling in every single regard. \n\nOne Outs is from 2008. Gurazeni is from 2018. Ten years between these two, and One Outs is a billion times more fun to watch and is fucking way better looking, and while One Outs is certainly about the money that the protagonist is earning from the sport, I never thought it was insulting to the sport of baseball.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/9K1Arwc.png)\n\n...I'm honestly not even sure if I'm going to continue into the already confirmed [second season](https://anilist.co/anime/102974/Gurazeni-Money-Pitch-2/). Almost feel like I have to just to see if this aimless and worthless series is just going to continue on episodically forever or if it ever actually obtains a purpose or a point.\n\nThat's neither here nor there, though. I give the first season of Gurazeni a __5 out of 100__. I think it's probably safe to call it the absolute worst baseball series despite the fact the original manga series has ~~somehow~~ won awards. ~~The [other major contender](https://anilist.co/anime/21702/Battery/) in my opinion I guess you could at least say it's more a drama than an actual sports series.~~\n\n_Gurazeni is probably one of the worst sports series period, actually. But I haven't watched enough of them to feel confident enough to outright make that claim. It's absolutely the worst of the ones I HAVE watched, though._\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/C48iFV6.png)~~~"}, {"id": 2933, "score": 0, "body": "It's both really easy and really difficult to claim that something is either \"the best\" or \"the worst\" of something. It's really easy in the sense anyone can hyperbolically claim something is \"the best\" or \"the worst\" based on their personal preferences and/or depending on their love or hate of said thing. It can also be really difficult from a critical standpoint, since things can be good and bad for different things, and you can always call something worse.\n\nUsually, most titles in any form of media have SOMETHING redeemable about them, even if they're really easy to hate or make fun of when it comes to their flaws. Personally, i very rarely call something \"the best\" or \"the worst\", even if i absolutely hate it or love it. But in this case, i have to make an exception. Abunai Sisters: Koko & Mika is one of the worst anime I've ever seen, and it comes in swinging hard, making itself an easy candidate for \"Worst Anime of All Time\"\n\nAbunai Sisters is a short 10 episode OVA released in 2009, barely lasting ~30 minutes total. It barely sold over 250 copies of the DVD. Considering that the first 500 copies to be pre-ordered came with bonuses such as figurines, discounts, and even shout-outs to those first 500 to have pre-ordered, it comes off as extra sad that almost no one ordered this thing. But its easy to see why no one did. If it wasn't for the fact that owning a copy is one of the most embarrassing things to have in your library.\n\nAnd to make it more insulting, this was produced by PRODUCTION I.G. of all companies. These are the guys who released Eden of the East, FLCL, and the Ghost in the Shell franchise, and a plethora of other high quality of animation both before and after Abunai Sisters. Did someone at the company lose a bet? Or have a stoke or get an injury to the head?\n\nOnly two episodes of this how managed to make it to television, and for a while, those two episodes where the only thing you could get your hands on. Thankfully (or woefully, depending on your view), all the episodes were uploaded on torrent sites. Unfortunately, for some reason, the uploaded uploaded them with the voices pitched up, so the voices become literally unbearable. There does exist a copy of the entire series on YouTube with their voices normalized though, if you're a masochist.\n\nWhen it comes to plot, there is no plot. It's about two large breasted bimbos who happened to be some sort of secret agents and they both get into antics where the two bad guys, a large headed woman reminiscent of Yubaba from Spirited Away, and her lackey try to either kill them or steal their \"Boobie Stone\". That's right, the \"Boobie Stone\".\n\nThe \"Boobie Stone\" keeps them young as well as giving them \"Boobie Powers\", which save them from danger, and the bad guys want the power of the \"Boobie Stone\" for themselves. And that's the entire joke. I can't believe i typed that out.\n\nThe animation is awful. It's barely reaches the PS1 era of CGI cutscene. Even weirder is that the animation is definitely motion captured, which means that people put time and effort into this OVA. There are so many other anime projects that should have got the time, money, and effort thrown at them, that it makes me wonder why this series was even considered in the first place.\n\nThere is no Japanese dub. You read right, there is no Japanese dub, only the English dub. Considering that this is one of the worst English dubs I've ever heard, with the voices being a mix of nails on a chalkboard, wailing cats, and a bad case of tinnitus, i don't see how a Japanese dub could have been any better. Taking a rusty knife to the eardrums would mean you wouldn't have to hear it anymore and would give you a sigh of relief.\n\nWhat little music there is is as grating as the voice acting, with the theme painfully drilling itself into your mind, wishing you had some aspirin.\n\nYou might think to torrent this for a laugh with friends, but don't bother. There are plenty of So-Bad-It's-Good anime out there that i would be a shame to spend the time torrenting this and watching it with your friends. If you dare, you can find copies of it floating around. The one positive thing i can say about it is that the story behind it is slightly more interesting than the series itself. Which is not saying much because it's not that interesting to begin with."}, {"id": 2946, "score": 20, "body": "Houseki no Kuni is the dullest anime I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in a long time, which is ironic considering the gemstone theme.  This review will go over why I thought so, and I hope you are able to understand my point of view.\n\n~~~img640(https://i.imgur.com/VWlsd7c.jpg)~~~\n\nBefore that, though, I want to take a little bit of time to praise the visuals.\n\nAs you likely know by now, Houseki no Kuni is a fully CG anime.  It also happens to be far and above the best-looking one, and uses the medium to its advantage rather than just as a cost-saving measure.  The most obvious example of this is the characters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hair, which has a captivating translucency that seems perfect for CG.  And during the action sequences, the camera has these wild panning, sweeping, rotating motions to capture what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on from every angle.  They never go too far as to be sickeningly fast, and add a lot of eye candy that would have been prohibitively expensive and time-consuming with traditional animation.  There are a lot of great shots of the environment as well.  Everything is lush with greenery and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cschool\u00e2\u0080\u009d they live in has an imposing, hallowed sort of feel with its massive stone architecture.  The only flaw in this sense is that since the events take place within such a small radius you end up seeing a lot of the same areas over and over.  Nevertheless, in general the shot composition is quite good.  A few shots in particular stick in my mind, like the scene in episode 7 when the gems go to sleep (incidentally, probably my favorite episode).  And during calmer scenes the camera frequently is placed way behind any of the characters to show how small they are in comparison to the empty world they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in.  Overall it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just quite well-done.  Every other CG anime should take after this one.\n\n~~~img640(https://i.imgur.com/RfPYSaq.jpg)~~~\n\nUnfortunately, now we have to get to the aspects I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like.\n\n# __Visuals__\n\nWait, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I like the visuals?  Yeah, but there are some definite improvements that could be made.  The first is quite obviously the framerate.  I must give credit to Houseki no Kuni for breaking new ground in the CG space and being the first CG anime to render everything at a barely-watchable framerate.  This is a quantum leap from previous CG works which typically ran at about a silky smooth 3 FPS.  But even if Houseki no Kuni has made strides in this department, a barely-watchable framerate is still barely acceptable, or perhaps not acceptable at all.  I get it, Japan, buying rendering time is expensive, but you need to hit a full, actual 24 FPS.  Anything less is too stuttery.  If you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford it, then delay the project five years until costs come down.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d gush over 60 or 120 FPS but I know that is never going to happen so I will settle for 24.\n\nSecondly, it's not a big problem while watching the show, but it's clear this is a product of a CG anime industry in its infancy.  I mentioned the shot composition is often pretty great, but just as often it's on a bland shot of a field or two characters talking.  As CG anime keeps getting better I'm sure directors will find more and more interesting things to do with the camera during downtime.\n\nFinally, the character design, or rather lack thereof.  Their heads and hair are different but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it - every character looks exactly the same from the neck down.  A gangly CLAMP-style body, but with considerable hips, each in the same drab black school uniform.  \n\n~~~img180(https://i.imgur.com/XKZLRWR.png)~~~\n\n>\"Wow!  What Amazing\u00c2\u00ae and Unique\u00c2\u00a9 character design!\"\n\nActually, speaking of considerable hips, that reminds me.\n\n# __\u00e2\u0080\u009cGender neutral\u00e2\u0080\u009d characters__\n\n~~~img640(https://i.imgur.com/Xfb2mXd.png)~~~\n\n>\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne of these things is not like the others, one of these things doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t belong\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really care a whole lot one way or another, but when I heard talk about there only being gender-neutral characters I was a somewhat intrigued.  So I was a little disappointed when I watched the show for myself and saw that, for all intents and purposes, every character was just a girl except for Kongou.  They may only use male/neutral pronouns to refer to themselves and others, but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really affect anything at all.  This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really a complaint per se, but the \u00e2\u0080\u009cgender neutrality\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the characters just seems like a gimmick to stimulate discussion and interest in the series rather than being of any consequence.\n\n# __Plot__\n\n~~~img640(https://i.imgur.com/k0gKodt.png)~~~\n\nNothing happens.  This is barely an exaggeration.  For the first half of the show it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Phos doing monster-of-the-week crap with a new buddy.  Except it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not even monster of the week since it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basically just the Lunarians every time.  Walk around, get careless, get attacked by Lunarians suddenly, someone gem breaks, everything is okay in the end.  The developments are so inconsequential that if someone explained the plot of the first six episodes to you in three minutes you could go on to episode 7 without having really missed anything.  The second half does have slightly more variety.  In particular the winter scenes were a nice change of pace.  Nevertheless just about all that happened was \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even my final form\u00e2\u0080\u009d Phos.  There are no subtleties here, for any given episode you wouldn't miss out on much of anything by just reading the Wikipedia summary instead.\n\n# __Cinnabar__\n\n~~~img640(https://i.imgur.com/KSYzJaq.jpg)~~~\n\nI only mention Cinnabar separately from the rest because they are listed as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmain\u00e2\u0080\u009d character in the Anilist database.  What a joke.  They show up one minute per episode to mope then go back to their cave.  Their inclusion is entirely pointless and only serves to act as some sort of anchoring point to pretend there is an arc between episodes 1 and 12.  I guess this is enough of a segue to talk about the rest of the characters.\n\n# __Characters__\n\nEvery character but Phos is completely one-note and forgettable.  Actually, I take that back, over half of them are zero-note.  There simply are not any personalities; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s amazing how bland the characters are.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m reminded of [the classic Phantom Menace review that challenges people to describe various characters without describing their appearance or role.](https://youtu.be/FxKtZmQgxrI?t=413)  I wonder how well people would fare with Houseki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cast.  We could add that you can't mention their hardness level either.\n\n~~~img115(https://cdn.anilist.co/img/dir/character/reg/123391-14y2fwPu4DBo.png)~~~\n~~~_Euclase:_~~~\n>\u00e2\u0080\u009cUh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 um\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 which one was that again?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n~~~img115(https://cdn.anilist.co/img/dir/character/reg/123393-3kmyVO2LDT5d.png)~~~\n~~~_Jade:_~~~\n>\u00e2\u0080\u009cHm\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Uh, normal, I guess?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPerhaps those two are a little unfair.  Despite popping up fairly often throughout the series they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very important characters after all.  Although one wonders why you would bother having thirty introduced characters in the first place if only two or three are of any importance.\n\n~~~img115(https://cdn.anilist.co/img/dir/character/reg/123387-y31D28j82efS.jpg)~~~\n~~~_Amethyst:_~~~\n>\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey're twins!

Kongou is definitely sleepy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nYou see my point.  If you thought as hard as you could, you might be able to come up with more than one adjective for Diamond or Antarcticite, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about it.  No one but Phos is of any interest.\n\n# __Phos__\n\n~~~img638(https://i.imgur.com/UrVugTi.png)~~~\n\nI made a mistake in the last section by implying Phos might be an interesting character.  \n\nMinor spoilers:  ~!About the extent of their development is getting the ability to talk to fish and super-speed legs.  Then later when the author decided super-speed legs weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very interesting, said powers were retconned away with Phos also getting golden Mr. Fantastic arms and a haircut.  Not to mention that each of these powers were acquired in the same stupid way.  Fishspeak, Phos is left unsupervised and she is eaten by the fish thing.  Super speed legs, Phos is left unsupervised, gets easily tricked by by said fish and is knocked around by Lunarians.  Golden arms, Phos is left unsupervised and falls into an icy pond.  Why are you still leaving this incompetent gem alone!?  Maybe this was Kongou\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan all along, leave her alone so her arms and legs will get ripped off and then level up conveniently.  They should just do this with all of the gems.  Additionally, I have to question what this means symbolically for character growth.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re weak, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re useless, but if you are also a huge idiot and put yourself in danger repeatedly then you might get sweet cyborg limbs?  I have a hard time thinking that was the intent here, so the only interpretation left is that these were just cheap tricks to keep the main character relevant to the meager plot somehow.!~\n\nHalfway through the show Phos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 character changes drastically but I have a hard time accepting this as a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccharacter arc.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more like they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re one character the first half and another character in the second.  This change comes off as forced as if the author couldn't figure out how else to progress the story.\n\n# __The ending__\n\n~~~img640(https://i.imgur.com/yEcljig.jpg)~~~\n\nI wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t invested in the show by the end anyway so I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care that much, but prospective viewers should be aware that this anime has a non-ending.  I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fault Houseki for that too much though as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just the realities that come with adapting an ongoing manga.\n\n# __Conclusion__\n\n~~~img640(https://i.imgur.com/YkDS5i7.jpg)~~~\n\nI suppose that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about all I wanted to say.  Truly, without meaning to offend, I am not sure what people liked about this show.  The OP was nice, the music was very good, the visuals were flawed but intriguing.  Yet that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about it.  I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but feel this got the attention it did primarily because it was CG, rather than that being a detriment to its popularity.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll end it off with a quote from mathemagican\u00e2\u0080\u0099s review on MAL which sums up my feelings pretty well:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA bland cast of characters fights a boring monster of the week that goes nowhere.

When it comes to every other genre, there is at least something to enjoy or appreciate, like it's atmosphere, technical quality, soundtrack, maybe a great performance or two, or it's potential. With a comedy, it relies entirely on it's jokes, and when it's jokes aren't funny, it has absolutely nothing to go on. And there isn't a point in pointing out the good parts of a comedy when the entire reason you're there is terrible. That's where Spelunker Sensei comes in.\n\nBased on the Spelunker Sensei video game franchise, Spelunker Sensei (AKA Spelunker is a Teacher) is a one shot OVA that was released in March of 2011 about a man named Spelunker (yes, that really is his name) being a teacher in your stereotypical Japanese high school. That's pretty much the entire premise, since it relies entirely on the jokes. Or joke, singular, in Spelunker Sensei's case.\n\nThe entire joke is that Spelunker dies really easily, and he continually dies over and over again from things that don't normally kill people. It's literally one setup and premise repeated over and over again over 30 minutes, and it's not even that great joke to begin with. I wish it had been a lot more creative with it's joke. The OVA could have been Spelunker telling stories of his dying in various absurd or silly situations, but everyone points out that he couldn't have died because he's still alive, and that maybe he has a faulty memory, but maybe he was telling the truth the entire time because no one would believe that a man could die over and over again.\n\nBut i guess that would have cost too much money, because the OVA has some pretty bad animation. The OVA looks like it was animated by one person on Newgrounds in the mid 2000's. Or maybe they spent their entire budget on Tomokazu Sugita, who is known for his roles such as Kyon from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and Gintoki Sakata from Gintama. Did the guy owe someone something or lose a bet? There isn't an English dub, but i doubt anyone was expecting one of this.\n\nIn conclusion, don't watch Spelunker Sensei. Even so-bad-it's-good anime have more laughs than this.

But unlike most terrible anime, Mars of Destruction manages to condense its terribleness into 10 long enduring minutes, so you can loathe both it and life in general in the quickest time possible.\n\nMars of Destruction was released in 2005. The plot, what little there is, stars soon after a space shuttle returns from a mission to Mars in the far off futuristic year of 2010 ends up being destroyed in the Earth's atmosphere. Soon afterwards, strange monsters called \"Ancients\" begin appearing around Tokyo. A group of specialists taught to fight the \"Ancients\" must stop them before they destroy the human race. This sounds like an OK premise for something, and it has potential. Too bad Mars of Destruction doesn't go anywhere with it because of it's incredibly short running time.\n\nHowever, there is a reason for this. The entire OVA is a compilation of all of the animated cutscenes from the game it's based on. The company behind the game, Idea Factory, thought it was a good idea to take off the games cutscenes and slap them together and put them on DVD. This would have been a good idea as an unlockable on the game disc, or on a DVD that came with the Special Edition of the game so there is a higher resolution of them so fans can enjoy them. But a it's own DVD release?\n\nBecause there isn't anything between the cutscenes, all of the problems with the source material are highlighted. There are plot points that rip off Evangelion's plot, one of which includes one of the character's father suddenly putting them into the situation of having to save the world despite not paying them any attention before any of this went down.\n\nAnimation is limited and perspective is off a lot of the time. There was one instance where someone turns around, but the character's perspective suddenly changes half way though the animation. It's animated so poorly you have to wonder how no one noticed any of the flaws, although, this is the same company that thought it was a good idea to shove all of these cutscenes onto a DVD and try and sell it as it's own thing, so they probably didn't care.\n\nFrom what little I've seen of the game itself, it seems like your standard Visual Novel. I don't speak Japanese, but i imagine that the story is at least more fleshed out. I doubt it's good, but isn't a complete mess that the anime makes it look like it is. These scenes aren't even edited together well, looking like a YouTube compilation someone put together in 2007. You'd think that it would be bad enough someone poorly editing scenes together, the OVA is edited together with poorly rendered classical music.\n\nThe only reason to see this is to experience it's infamous levels of awfulness.

In case you don't know much about war-tactics: Throwing corpses into a well poisons the water inside, obviously making it undrinkable. This means that troops who want to use the village to refill their supplies and occupy the place can't do so, as the sole source of water is completely unusable. It's a standard tactic, aye, but I was still impressed to see it in use, as it showed that whoever made the manga this is based on had at least a basic understanding of war-tactics.\nAdditionally, I think that the action-scenes themselves were pretty well handled. They weren't as flashy and clever as JoJo's nor were they as exciting as Rakudai Kishi's, but they were definitely better than the action-scenes in the majority of action anime I've seen. There was just something about the MC slicing up multiple bad guys that was actually somewhat fun to watch.\n\nSpeaking of 'fun to watch', another thing I actually liked about this show was that it featured an actual Gatling Gun. Yes, I know, that's a weird thing to be excited about, but Mini-guns (and their ancestors, the Gatling Guns) are amongst the very few guns I actually like and they are almost never get featured in anything, so not only seeing the original GG, but also having it presented rather historically accurate was quite something for me. A very personal point, yes, but I think it still counts.\nThe last thing I actually liked about this show was its Opening. I'm not exaggerating when I say that this show had one of the coolest openings of the last year. I actually went out of my way to search for the opening on YT to listen to it occasionally, because it's really that good.\n\nBut that's where the pleasantries end. If you think that this sounds like a pretty interesting anime based on what you've read so far, don't worry, that's gonna change in just a minute.\nLet's start with the thing I hated the most about this anime: Its absolutely godawful attempts at Comedy. I'm fking serious. I don't think I've ever seen an anime where literally every single joke bombed completely. Every single time this anime felt like it was getting too decent, it decided to go into a completely terrible alternative art-style and make some of the characters perform the most tedious boke/tsukkommi routines I have ever had the displeasure of witnessing. Not to mention that even IF the jokes had been successful, they STILL would've been out of place, as there's very few ways to NOT make jokes seem OOP within a serious war setting. I honestly have NO idea why Drifters didn't just stay serious the entire time, as those were the times where this anime was actually bearable... most of the time.\n\nThe next thing I want to talk about is the Art-style of this show. And I know, I've already said how horrible the 'joke-art-style' looked, but the one for the serious parts was actually also not something I enjoyed. Yes, it was unique and probably took a lot of effort, but that still doesn't change the fact that I thought that it looked... sub-par. Maybe it's because I'm a spoiled KyoAni fanboy, but I really could not get myself to accept the art in this anime. I've HEARD that it looks a lot like Hellsing Ultimate (which I can neither confirm nor debunk, as I haven't watched HU), so I suppose if you've liked the art in Hellsing, then you can completely ignore what I just said, lol.\nNext up is the character development in this anime... or rather the lack there of. Seriously, the only one with any personality in that bunch seemed to be Nobunaga himself and Saint-Germi. The rest of them seemed to either be one-dimensional warmongers (like the MC himself) or completely lacked any personality or presence whatsoever (like Yoichi Suketaka Nasu, who was part of the main cast... and completely and utterly personality-less.) Probably the most vexing example of a lack of character development was with what might possibly be the main villain: 'The Black King.' (one of those titles right out of the 'generic villain name'-book). He was shown multiple times over the course of season one, yet I have no fking idea what he's supposed to be like.\n\nWhich leads us straight into the next point of criticism: the fact that the villain of the series was never characterized whatsoever. It is no secret that it's tough to hate a villain that you've never even seen do anything bad and of whom you've only seen a couple glimpses, which is why the most interesting villains are the ones that have a lot of presence like Yoshikage Kira (JoJo) or Handsome Jack (Borderlands 2). Hence it was rather confusing to see that the main villain of this series (who I THINK is the Black King... he's the only one who even came close to being one at least) was content with just sitting off-screen for the majority of the show, quietly minding his own business and who only did anything at the very end of season one... and even then, he didn't show up himself , but instead he sent an army of foot soldiers to deal with the army of the protagonists. IMO, that guy was one of the biggest failures of an antagonist I've ever seen, rivaling even the teacher from Boku dake ga inai machi.\n\nThis lack of character development COULD'VE been fixed, had they just not thrown in some characters for one, maybe two episodes before never bringing them up again. Seriously, just take a look at the 'characters' page of this anime for yourself. It should be obvious that with such a huge cast, it's impossible to characterize each and every one of them to a satisfying extend, so why did they insist on introducing such a pile of them. For some of them, I don't even know what their role was supposed to be, because they were introduced as if they were gonna be important, literally did one thing and then fked off into nothingness. Prime example: Zero-pilot Kanno Naoshi. He SEEMED like he could've been a really interesting addition to the party, not only because he came from a much more modern era than the rest of the cast but also because he was one of the few people that actually had a character. Which is why his share of screentime still baffles me: he appeared, shot down a dragon, crashed with his plane... and literally the only time he appeared after that was a couple episodes later where he was shown having started living inside of the crashed plane. That was it. I'm still not sure whether he was supposed to be a more important character who just got cut or not.\n\nThe next thing on the chopping block is the cliffhanger ending that this anime had. Because of my attempt to keep things spoiler-free, I'm not gonna go too in-depth, but here's what I will say: the first season of this anime basically ended with the protagonists and their army getting ready to defeat the Black King, but before literally anything of the sorts actually happened. I hate cliffhanger endings just as much as the next guy, so I am obviously pissed when an anime uses its main antagonist as the sequel-hook. However, seeing as how a 2nd season got confirmed right as the first one ended, I am willing to not see that point as harsh as I would normally.\n\nNext up, we've got the point where I almost dropped the anime outright. In episode 4, the protagonist's group, supported by the male elves they freed, march towards the castle in which the local bad guy had... basically kidnapped the female population of the elven village. They find out that the women had been locked into the castle's tower, and upon arriving there, they see that the guards of the castle had been repeatedly raping the elven women. Pretty much the ONLY reason why I didn't just drop the entire anime at that point (as my very personal opinion is that rape is the one thing that should never be happening) was because I was hoping that the guards would all be killed in the most visceral ways possible in the next episode (which only sorta happened). And before anyone jumps at me to say that 'it was obvious' and that 'it was a means of making you hate the bad guys', I would like to point towards an anime that handled a very similar situation (man kidnaps the female population of a settlement and locks them into the giant place he lives in) very differently and a lot 'better': Hitsugi no Chaika. In that show, it basically played out like this: the antagonist of that arc was a man whose 'hobby' was to slice up women and he was using the women he kidnapped as his 'test subjects'. It was a set-up that was still really effective at making you hate that guy, but it completely avoided making me hate the anime itself. So there you go, there was definitely an alternative way to handle the situation.\n\nLast up, there are two things I want to talk about about the archery in this anime. I am aware that these are, once again, points that might be completely irrelevant to you, but I still consider them important enough to include.\nFirstly: Fire arrows. Jesus fking Christ, when are people finally going to stop using fire arrows in their works if they have NO idea how they work?? If I got 5 cents every time somebody used them completely unrealistically, I could run my own 'Say NO to fire arrows' ad-campaign. In Drifters in particular, the fact that they were used this weirdly is even more interesting, as this anime tried to be realistic in its usage of weaponry.\nThe first time fire arrows showed up in this anime, I was actually somewhat impressed to see that they were used in one of the only two situations where people DID actually use them in the middle ages: during a siege. Sure, the effectiveness of those arrows was still ridiculous (real fire arrows had a chance of ~2% to set something aflame, here it seemed more like 98%), but it was something at least. However, the second time they were used it was back to good ol' 'this is NOT how they work. This is not how ANYTHING works'. For some stupid reason, the makers of this thought that it was a reasonable idea to have people use fire arrows... during a horse chase. Which would've worked, were it not for two simple things... a) No and b) NO!... but seriously, that part was fking stupid. There was no way for the horse-riders to set their arrows on fire, which means that there was no way to even HAVE fire arrows in that situation... and using them while riding a horse also seems like the best way to get yourself killed, so yeah. Stupid on every single level, which, sadly, seems to be the norm for fire arrows in anything from anime to movies to games. (for further knowledge about fire arrows, watch this 'ere: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTd_0FRAwOQ )\n\nAnd secondly... Why in the name of god did the professional archer in this anime hold his bow sideways on multiple occasions?? Doing so is pretty much the most sure-fire way to show your enemy that you have NO idea what the fk you're doing, as you pretty much sacrifice a large portion of your range and power for nothing. Every time the archer-guy held his bow that way, I started to think whether I should laugh or cry about that... and settled for being pissed off.\n\nAll in all: this anime was, all things considered, pretty fking bad in my opinion. My advice would be to just watch the Opening ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZnxv95EZGs ) until you're sick of it (which might take a while, as it's really good) and just give the anime itself a miss. You'll do yourself a favor."}, {"id": 2966, "score": 39, "body": "Never has a change in the animation studio been this apparent to me. That was essentially my first thought as I tried up to sum up my feelings about Date A Live. The main reason why I started watching this anime was because someone I know has it in her favorites list and I thought to myself 'eh. Why not.'... So I watched the first season and was pleasantly surprised. Harem anime have been some of my least favorite in the past, so I expected this one to be fairly similar... but honestly, the first season of this anime was really, really good. Mainly because it managed to escape quite a chunk of the normal things that harem anime go through, while still putting a spin on the things that it did do like almost every other harem out there. One scene that's still stuck with me is the Onsen episode in the first season, which was genuinly funny and was something I hadn't even remotely witnessed before. So after that first season, my expectations for the second season were quite high... and as you might've guessed from the very first sentence and my rating, I was thoroughly disappointed.\n\nSo why's that?? Well, mainly because the second season was missing both the cleverness and the heart of the first one... though it started out promising. The first episode felt just like something from the first season... but from the second episode onward, everything went straight down. Just like the first season, there was an Onsen episode here... but unlike back then, this one was just a plain, generic and unfun one, which would go on to set the tone for the remainder of the anime. The somewhat unique setting of the MC going on dates with characters and being 'supported' by a team of 'professionals', choosing his answers Visual Novel style was replaced by dull drama and fights that just weren't interesting whatsoever; the interesting characters of the first season (especially Yoshino) were put on the bench in favor of new characters that turned out to be as lively and engaging as a round of chess on a graveyard and the humor that gave the first season its charm was replaced by one-dimensional characters pretending to hav serious conversations during silly Mecha-suit fights... so in short, everything that made the first season stand out was switched out for generic things that are about as unique as water in Atlantis.\n\nThat said, it wasn't ALL bad (otherwise my score would've been even lower)... As mentioned above, the first episode was still really, really good and also there was a brief part during the beginning of the second arc where the humor of the first season flashed up again, when he had to dress up as and pretend to be a girl in order to get close to a spefic girl. Also on the rare occasions that the other characters from the first season DID show up, their personalities were kept intact, which was something I had feard would not be the case ('Dark Tohka' notwithstanding). Another thing that the second season did was make me realize just how good the first one had truly been, causing me to retroactively change my rating for that season from 7 to 8 points (which is something I almost never do. Once I've finished a season of an anime, I normally don't touch the score anymore).\n\nSo in the end, what I'm trying to get at here is that the second season was just completely lacking the heart, genius and charm of the first one and just felt like something that was thrown together with minimal effort just to rake in as much money as possible. Maybe it's just coincidential that there was this huge of a difference in quality once it was produced by a different studio, but I personally don't believe that. Especially since Production IMS is a studio that likes to put out low-effort harem anime (see also 'Hundred' and next season's 'Masou Gakuen HxH')"}, {"id": 2972, "score": 43, "body": "Warning, this review may contain spoilers.\n\nFirst impressions: When I first got into this show, I thought this would be a good show. Oh how I was wrong!\n\nStory: 3/10 \nIn the year 2022 humanity has managed to make a completely virtual environment-welcome to spreading autism online!\n\nThe premise for Sword Art Online is pretty much a trapped in a video game world kind of setting with the twist being that if you die in the game, then you die for real. I would like to add that as a player of video games myself, I could easy relate and I thought it was a pretty cool idea.\n\nOne problem I had with Sword Art Online was the romance elements which were a main focus of the story. Now I have no problem with romance being in this anime, the problem is the fact that the romance elements were poorly presented. One example is the romance between Kirito and Asuna, even though it's shown that they care deeply for each over. However, the problem is because of the time skips in the show we really don't see the transition of how they fell in love in the first place.\n\nAnother problem with the romance element is that they also had a some semi incest romance with the main character, Kirito, and his sister who is actually his cousin named Kirigaya. Now this part didn't bother me personally, but what did bother is the fact it was poorly executed with it being taken as nothing serious and just seems like it was added to just for fan-service. Which is a shame because they had some really good genuine moments in it and I feel if they took it more seriously it could have been very interesting.\n\nAnother problem I had with this show was the fact that this was a show that seemed like it wanted you to take it seriously. But I couldn't take it seriously because for some reason we have a harem in this story when a harem really wasn't needed in this type of story. And before you guys say that sword art online isn't a harem, I would like to state the sword art online is very obviously a harem show.\nAnother negative is also the fact they tried to add some video game to real life philosophy to make you take it more seriously and make it seem more deep and mature than it actually is. And while I was listening to this so called philosophy, I was wondering to myself what was the actual point of this. Because when shows in general have some sort of deep meaning that they want to tell you, they usually have some sort of point. For an example, for a show that has some deep meaning would probably be something like Death Note or Ergo Proxy and they pretty much told you their point fairly quickly if you are paying attention.\n\nNow the next thing I would like to talk about is the narrative of Sword Art Online. The story line pretty much time skips all over the damn place. Also, it never shows you what is happening in the outside world while these people are trapped in this video game. \n\nAnother thing I had a problem with is that, despite this being some what of a survival game, we really don't see much of the survival aspect of the story. We don't see many people die and this show usually only implies that people have died.\n\nCharacters: 2/10\nThe main character is just a bland Gary Stu who is over-powered, gets chicks, and make other men look like jerks.\n\nThe side characters are very one note. Also, these characters are the most bland I have seen in an anime to date. There is no character development. With all the shit these people had to go through, you would have expected some of these people to have major physiological issues, but they don't. There is no investment into the characters because of all the time skips.\n\nThe villains in this show are very one note as well. For villains in this show We have got the troll, a rapist, and a group of people who kill people for fun. So pick your poison\n\nArt: 8/10 \nThe animation is just a godsend on your eyes. The backgrounds are done fantastically. The fights scenes are good. It also has some pretty decent CGI. This is a show you should see in HD if you can.\n\nIt has a pretty generic style to it and the characters design are ok as well.\n\nSound: 8/10\nThe OST is great I could listen to the soundtrack for hours. The OST was composed by Yuki Kajiura who has also done the OST for Fate Zero.\n\nThe voice acting for both sub and dub where decent as well, but I would recommend the dub.\n\nEnjoyment: 7/10 \nNow to Sword Art Online's credit, I can see that this anime had some great ideas for the story and characters, but didn't put it to full use. I love the fight scenes and the OST, but other than that it is pretty much bad in every other aspect. So I liked it but for very superficial reasons.\n\nOverall: 4/10\nSo overall, this is a type of show that took style over content and when it tries to be deep and it ends up looking stupid. But the only positive I would say about it overall is that it's an anime that is very easy to get into, so it's a good entry level show for those who are new to anime. But if you have quite bit of experience with anime, then you will probably dislike this show for how much of a train wreck it is."}, {"id": 2973, "score": 40, "body": "Warning this review may contain spoilers. \n\nFirst impressions, when I got into the show I went into it with low hopes of this being good. \nCause oh boy was a right to do so because no one could prepare me for the train wreck that is guilty crown but it was a fun train wreck.\n\n\nStory, 3/10\n\nIt has been ten years sense the apocalypse virus first made contact with the people of Japan and during the chaos of the first outbreak the u.n sent an GHQ to help the people of Japan in there hour of need and contained the outbreak at great cost.\nBut sadly, during their ten years of service the GHQ have become tyrannical and are even oppressing the very people they were supposed to protect.\nbut not all is lost Because a king will rise and free the people of Japan and restore peace and freedom.\nAre story beginning main character Shu a bland high school student who is bored and what's some exacting to happen. \n(Be careful what you wish for Shu because you might get it)\nSo, one day while he chilling he comes across an injured girl named inori and while he is talking to her she gives shu this vial and requests him to deliver it to someone named gai. After there little chat she is taken away very by the GHQ and shu goes to deliver this vial. He finds out that this guy named gai in the leader of a rebel group named funeral parlour who main mission is the kick the GHQ out of the country and return Japan independence.\nSo, during their little chat funeral parlour base becomes under Attack and gai tells shu to get the vial out of there because he doesn't really have the Choice to say no at this point.\nSo, during the battle Shu manages to save inori and while there getting chased the vial gets shot and then shu gets a super power called the power of kings \nWhich gives him the ability to pull weapons and items called voids.\nUsing this ability, he manages to help keep the GHQ at bay during the Attack and now weather he wants to or not he has become the secret weapon of funeral parlour in their fight against the GHQ.\n\nSo, the story for Guilty crown is pretty much the text book example of a cookie cutter/ jack of all trades plot.\nBecause takes a lot of elements from quite a few different shows.\nLike for example code geass, blue gender and soul taker are the Main ones I can see here.\nBecause Japan has been invaded by an evil organization, there is some sort virus going around that killing people, there a power out there can people call the power of kings, and last and not lest there an Adam and Eve sub plot about human evolution for something like that.\nNow you are probably thinking that I have a problem with this kind of cookie cutter/jack of all trades storyline and I do have a kind of problem with it but for now let's just talk about how the story plays out.\njust word to the wise I am pretty much going to spoil most of the major plot points because if I don't you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going understand the mind set I have while going into this review.\n\nSo, the first half of the story can be summed up as training, terrorist missions and school life bullshit.\nAnd to be perfectly honest these where the most boring episodes I have ever had to sit through in my life. \nI don't have a problem with the training and the missions because they were engaging and they got the point across of why this terrorist organization is fighting this evil organization because the end game of this organization was slightly interesting to say the least. \nbut the school life shit is boring and predictable to say the least. So, after these missions and school life bullshit.\nSo, we find out that inori is a clone of the main character Older sister mana who was pretty much patient zero of this virus and apparently plans to marry shu to kill all humanity and birth a new race for something like that and there a few people in this other group that are trying to achieve that.\n\n\nThe second half \nIs after this huge explosion takes place the entire city is fucked up and cut off from the rest of the world.\nMain character becomes the leader of this pseudo society that been formed my high school kids and members of the rebel group which is running ok under the leadership of the main character and the people who give him advice.\nThis is probably the better part of the story. \nBecause main character isn't being as passive as he used to be as he is now put into the leader role instead of being the passive follower that takes orders.\nBut after a few certain events he becomes a tyrannical king of a dictator ship and I am Like holy shit this is cool it's is a lot more interesting than the missions and the school life bullshit.\nBut like most dictatorships the end in a very bad way with shu being overthrown and just before they kill him. \nGai Comes out of Where takes his powers and is now working for the people that he was originally trying to fight against.\nShu ends up escaping and becomes a depressed emo while gai is continuing his evil plan.\nAfter shu step mom steels the last magic vail with super powers to give it someone which can defeat gai and evil organization.\nshu pretty much gets his powers back and they end it with a huge boss fight with every going back to normal.\nExcept now main character is blind and has a robot arm.\n\n\nThe One and only positive I am going to say is the fact that this show had quite a lot of promise to it Despite its cookie cutter/ jack of all trades storyline and at face it's written alight.\nBut that where my povtives end because I have quite a few things to say about this show. \nBut, I quick side note before I continue.\nwhen I think about Guilty crown story line is almost like a role reversal of code geass. \nIt's Like a what if situation of what would happen if Suzaku was the main character instead of lelouch \nBecause shu reminds me a lot of Suzaku from code geass and gai is like lelouch Except the more water downs version of them.\n\nBut back to the negatives.\nI think My main problem is shows like this can't seem to keep a consistent tone going and guilty crown is especially guilty of this, no pun intended. \nBut the tone of this show pretty much changes every episode, from war drama to rom-com to ecchi to slice of nothing really happens and then to shock factor at the drop of a hat It's comes off as very disjointed.\none example there is one episode where they are at the beach doing pretty much slice of nothing really happens with some fanservice stuff going down and then halfway through the episode it becomes an espionage mission with them trying to get into one of the bad guys bases at the same time.\nSo, while this happy go lucky shit going down there are explosions and people dying left and right, blood and body parts flying everywhere and then in a second we are back to swim suits and school bullshit.\n\n\nAnother major thing that really bothered be with guilty crown is the fact that for the most part the story line is very forced.\nAnd you guys who are reading this review are probably saying what story isn't somewhat forced in some way and for the most part you would be right. \nBut the main problem is the fact that the main character was pretty much forced against his will to join this rebellion that he didn't want to join or have any involvement with in the first place He just wanted something exacting to happen.\n\nHe was passive doing whatever this rebel group was telling him to do and pretty much going with the flow of things. \nWhich isn't a good thing when your main character who I might add is going to be one of the major driving force in your story is this passive especially in this type of setting and story.\nUnlike for example code geass where the main character had a goal in mind and he was always a proactive force in the story and it was the world reacting to him as a character. \n\nAnother problem I had is with guilty crown is the fact it's was very random at times with is plot twists.\nthe plots twists seem to pretty much come out of nowhere with no foreshadowing and no explanation of why these things are happening.\nLike for example gai being alive and becoming a bad guy, like I understand he explained his reasons for why he did it but he could have just done that all by himself without getting the main character involved. \nBecause if his goal is to free mana and end the virus he could have done that by himself because he had the same powers as the main protagonist at that point in time.\nThe only thing they ever foreshadowed was the thing with the main character sister and that inori was related to that.\n\nThe last nail in the coffin is the amount of logic this series brakes.\nLike one big example is that inori is a famous pop idol and the evil organization knows she has connected to the terrorist group. But when she transfers into shu school and start hanging around. there are no police that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comes to arrest her or no one wondering why an idol is hanging around their school.\nIt's brakes logic especially because inori is needed for the evil organization plan yet they don't capture her when they could have done so easily.\nAnd that one example I can list probably 10 -20 more examples that this show brakes logic and makes no sense and it's not just main plot details or situations because that's is completely different ball game. \nIt's the little things as well \nLike then they have that pseudo society they still had the Internet and phones still working.\nso why couldn't use those to tried to contact people from the outside while they were trapped. \nBecause the reason why there walled off and cut from the world in the first place is because the local government at large thinks that everyone that lived there is dead and what left in that area is ground zero for another outbreak of the virus.\n\n\nSo basically, don't use your brain and the story will be fine.\n\nCharacters,3/10 \n\nthe main character is pretty much a bland passive introvert who really doesn't do much and he stays that way in till the series reaches it second half. But up to that point he was bland as a character and in all honesty, he bored me to tears while he was on screen.\nBut then though certain events of the show at the half way point he basically becomes a dictator and starts his own kingdom which wasn't exactly the best thing for this character in my opinion because he way more edger than I thought he would be. \nBut it's better and more interesting to watch than person he was from ep one.\nSo, after his dictatorship ends like most dictatorships do.\nhe goes through a stage of depression and realizes it time for him to man up and fix the problems that he has caused and this is where he comes this mainly badass and he is fun to watch at this point.\nBut it already too late for me to care about him as a character because they wasted so much time of him generic as fuck and he only gets good when we get to the half way point but even his development comes off as a little rushed and unnatural.\n\n\nThe side characters are pretty much very one note with nothing really to remember about them.\nThey just feel like hollow shells as characters and even some characters will get re written on the fly just because.\nLike shu wifuu Inori .\nshe kills people with no hesitation and then during some episodes she says she doesn't want to kill people yet in those same episodes she kills them anyway even if When killing them isn't exactly the only option as hand.\n\nThere is some characters development, but it's is very poorly done with the show pretty much time skipping whenever a character is going through some development. Then we see some characters change into completely different people as they pretty much went through the development off screen. \nNow I don't hate the fact there was character development, but problem that I had is pretty much the fact we never got to see their inner monologue and the transition of them slowly changing into a different person. \nWitch in turn made the character development Null and void for me because proper character development takes time and is more of a slow process from A to b.\n\nAnother thing I want to address is that the character interactions feel very bland and almost random at times.\nLike most of the show they feel very bland and copy paste.\n\nBut after the dictatorship and the people the main character was close to that betyed him after he Comes back as his manly badass self they just forgive him and their friends again.\nEven though he put them through 6 months of hell on earth and they even left shu to bleed out as gai took his powers.\nIn fact, I don't know why shu even cares about these people because some of those people have pretty much stabbed him in the back quite a few times and yet after all that shit there still good friends.\neven though he should go and tell them all to go fuck themselves and get better friends.\n\nAlso, the bad guys in this series suck and the only bad guy that remotely decent is gai when he comes the main villain.\nThe rest of throw away fodder I couldn't care less about.\nThere pretty much there to be hated.\n\nArt, 8/10\n\nThe animation is pretty much on a god tier level of animation. It has some fantastic CG animation that doesn't clash with the 2D animation.\nIt also has some fantastic actions scenes that will make you cry how well done they are.\nGreat background's that capture's the epic size of this hi-tech city.\nThis is a show you should watch in HD if you can.\n\nThe character design is ok but I think the Mecha are generic and kind of boring.\nExcept the main character step mother like holy shit 10/10 why isn't she in hentai \nBecause she would be perfect.\n\nSound, 8/10 \n\nThe op and ending songs are alright but nothing that really moved me.\nHas a pretty good ost, that fits the tone for every scene the anime will have. \nAlso, the that ost piece bios sounds fucking amazing when they use it.\nThe ost was composed by hiroyuki sawano who has also done the ost for kill la kill and attack on Titan.\nSub and dub are good.\nBut the like the dub better because the main character is voiced by the same person who did the voice for the main character Ayumu in is this a zombie.\n\n\nEnjoyment, 6/10\nNow despite this show pretty much being a train wreck of an anime, I found myself very entertained with the few aspects the show did well at.\nI thought the whole void power was an interesting idea for a power.\nI also liked the ost and animation but that was pretty much it from what I liked about guilty crown.\n\nOverall. 4/10\nIf you are new to anime or looking for something just for entertainment then guilty crown can provide you to a T.\nbecause the animation is nice it has a good ost, some good action. \nBut the moment you look at this show criticality is the moment it falls apart because it's story and characters are very poorly handled.\nIf it was taken more seriously and they did some slight story and character edits this would have been a good anime."}, {"id": 2981, "score": 30, "body": "Warning This review may contain spoilers.\n\nFirst impressions, so we got an underdog story in the world where magic and science have fused into one. So this sounds interesting enough what could possibly go wrong?\n\nStory, 3/10\nIn a world where magic and science come together. Where a massive world war took place Which was not going to show you because that might be too complex to show and care about good storytelling, How about instead we show you the adventures of a two siblings a brother named Tatsuya and his sister Miyuki going through magic high school, Which for some reason has a caste system in place. That puts you in different classes depending on your magical ability instead of your actual skill or talent you may have. Basically what happens is are sibling duo take this test with the Little sister ending up in top classes known as the bloom with her older brother Tatsuya who is the main character being put in the weed cast. Who surprisingly possesses skills and knowledge that reach way higher levels than 99% of his classmates even those who are bloom class are nothing more than mere pebbles when compared to him.\nSo basically this try's to be some sort of underdog story that also trying to do a critic of some of the negatives of human society. Which on paper sounds like a good idea. But it falls apart when your main character is overpowered as all fuck and your content is about as shallow as a kiddie pool, Like why would you have a caste system in a magic high school where everyone comes from powerful magical family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s or have skills way above the average joe. So any student that would be going to this school have already proven that there a cut above everyone else and also if the goals of these schools are to train new magicians as weapons and etc then why wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they just go like full Meritocracy and just have the students compete against one another in various fields to find the best students and those who performed well get awarded and have certain privileges, that would have been better and far more effective for training the next generations of magicians. Instead of my magical ability better than yours reee so I going to be a one Dimensional asshole towards you. \nAnd to top it all off add in a whole cluster fuck of overused tropes and clich\u00c3\u00a9s from light novels In Till it becomes an unbelievable cringe-fest of epic proportions. But if you want to know the story contains I am happy to tell you. The story from about 5-6 episodes is about this school class system bullshit which at face value was kind of interesting and thought-provoking when I first watched it when I was first getting into anime.But when I stepped back and actually thought about it.I realized that the conflict is shallow. And that basically the same thing for every theme this show try's to do.\nAt face value it all good and Dandy But when you look back and think about it.You start seeing these big holes in logic But back to the story. The rest of the story basically just, terrorist Attucks, school torments and a bunch of random shit that just isn't interesting or has any tension to it.Especially Because the main character can pretty much kill any threat in an in a split second without much effort. But To make my point more clear there is one scene where he gets shot straight in the heart and their blood everywhere. And I don't need to tell you that even if you live past a gunshot to the heart which is pretty much is unlikely to happen. You would basically die from blood loss if you didn't get to the hospital in time. What happens is that his sister gets rid of one of the limiters that holding his power back and he gets back up no problem at all even with the blood loss and during the end, he just goes full This is a featured article. Click here for more information. Page semi-protected Listen to this article Jesus-kun mode and blows up an entire naval fleet in a few seconds so in honesty this show story has failed in almost every aspect it done. Calling it generic as an insult would probably be the understatement of the century. Even for an anime based on a light novel, it's horrid. it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost like this series just wants to test the waters to see how little effort people you have to put into your series while at the same time making tons of money from your bottom of the barrel trash.\nThe only positive I can actually list is that I think the setting is interesting. With how the magic works, the magic families and there politics and the how modern science and magic has become to this one thing. Like the idea of magic and technology merging into this one thing is really interning idea and the whole idea of these magic clans, governments, or other terrorist factions battling each over to get a leg up over one another. That makes the world and the politics feel way more organic and gives the series some actual depth if they actuality focused on it. But even that can't save face fully when it doesn't go in as deep as it should as what this series is adapted is mostly focusing on school bullshit and when it comes to the magic system they throw so much techno babe at you. That it really hard to get a proper footing when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to wrap your head around this magic system. What would have been really cool is that instead of this high school bullshit, they could have turned this series into some epic global political thriller with various organizations trying to one-up each other similar to darker than black. That would have been cooler and way better than what we got.\n\n\nCharacters, 3/10\nThe main character Tatsuya is bland as toast with no emotions because his family literally took his emotions away except for slight protective feeling for his little sister, basicity his family turned him into a sociopath. Which could have been interesting if they were using his character exploring and talking about the inhumanity of such individuals or what makes them tick and guides their moral compass. That would have been cool and deep, but no all we get is another soulless self-insert who kind of a nice-ish guy despite his sociopath \"testacy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\". At least the show took the time to explain why it happened, But even the reasoning behind it was stupid. Basically, the main character had his emotions taken away from him Because from what is shown so far is that his family thought he would turn ageist the clan and kill them all of them because he was very powerful even as a young boy. And I guess if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a young child that is basicity a ticking time bomb of magical power and emotions then it would make sense why his family would want to try to get that under control or at least prevent the possibility to him losing control of his power and going themo nuclear on everyone asses. \nBut the logic and reasoning behind it still fall apart, when you consider if he no emotions. That would means his mind is mostly running on a logos based thought process correct, ok So what would actually happen if it became logical to turn around and kill his entire clan in order to reach a certain goal and he has no emotions and dosnt even have a bound with 99% of his family because of what they did to him and also the fact they treat him like dog shit, (even though he is handsome, smart, owns a very successful business on the side and is highly trained in various combat skills.) \nBottom line is that his clan are imbecile because if they thought taking his emotions away would make him easy to control and he never turns ageist them despite how they treat him they are dead wrong. Because of there such a thing as psychopaths/ sociopath who in laymen terms have every little emotions or empathy for others at all and have no problem killing people at all. and even though Tatsuya isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really malicious in most of his actions. You cant forget the fact that in this series alone he has killed a lot of people with zero fucks given, grated most of the time it was in self-defense or he was protecting his sister, but who to say he won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t turn around and do the same thing to his family. Also if he has no emotions then why the fuck does he actually invest time In combat training or anything for that matter. Because he would have to have some sort of motivation or passion to do that. Which he doesn't because he's a robot that will never become a real boy.\n\nAlso his younger sister Miyuki has to be by far the most annoying character in the whole show. Even more annoying than the one-dimensional assholes that populate the show like flies. She is basically then the only thing the Main character has a slight emotional attachment to and for some reason she has a brother complex. Which doesn't really make much sense because we find out that in the past even she treated him like shit in till awhile ago. Plus he has been an emotionless robot for most of his life. So Whatever speck of humanity that was in him is already long gone. I mean she would probably have a deeper relationship with a teddy bear than her robot of a brother.\n\nThe side characters are pretty much hollow shells with no personality or anything interesting about them. They are basically just so one note. There like background characters. Because every time I watch this show I have to remind myself that these characters actually exist. And when they talk about themselves or some sort of backstory. Its like for me who the fuck are you again.\n\nArt, 7/10\nThe animation was good, backgrounds are kind of average.\nIt has some very bright colors which help add to the magic ability\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that go on in the series It has some of the c.g.i Animation and considering japan tack record for CGI in anime this is quite imperative that it looks nice and doesn't clash with the 2d animation The art style of generic as fuck.The characters design look so plain and hollow. It basically a copy and paste from most light novel series. \n\nSound, 5/10\nThe op and ending songs I don't give a fuck about in the lest. the ost is ok as a whole. Nothing really good or bad about it. But I think it's ok to check it out. The ost was done by Taku Iwasaki who has done the ost for soul taker and black butler for example. When it comes to voice acting I felt everyone did an ok job distaste how bad this series is and the dialog is dry as toast.\n\n\nEnjoyment, 2/10\nEnjoyment or lack of enjoyment, in this case, I found nothing really enjoyable about this show. I found it a very soulless watch. it is one of worse shows I have watched in my life And I would put this show in my top ten worse anime I have watched list. I am pretty sure I would have enjoyed this show more if there was personally or spirit put behind it, because of the world and some of the elements this show was slightly interesting. But it's hard to care when it every clear that the people to did this show had a gun pointed at their head.\n\n\nOverall,3/10 \nThere is no way in hell I would recommend this to anyone under any circumstances. Even my worse enemy's I wouldn't show this trash to them. If your new to anime don't waste your time on this show, Because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to look back and realize your wasted time. And that you could have watched someone else that you probably would have enjoyed ten times better than this. My advice just pretends this doesn't exist, Hell even madhouse who did the anime for this pretends it doesn't exist as well. The only reason I can see people watching this is that the music is passable and the visuals look very nice. Because story and characters are pretty much non-existent.\nIf you like the ideas this series has your better of watching failed knight, a certain magical index or strike the blood.\n"}, {"id": 2982, "score": 41, "body": "Warning This review may contain spoilers.\n\nFirst impressions, so we got modern Japan meets fantasty world with the help of an magic inter dimensional gate that appears out of nowhere sounds interesting enough.\n\nStory, 4/10\n\nWhen a magic inter dimensional portel opens up in Japan.\n\nHordes of Fantasy Warriors and monsters poor out and Attck the people of Japan.\nWith one man standing in there way.\nA Japanese soldier named Itami who manages to lead a counter defense in order to push the intruders back.\nWhich actually works even though any one with half a brain could have come up with it.\n\nSome time after the attack he is apparently a hero now and promoted in the army.\nSo after that he is in the first squadron of the Japanese army to explore this new land and etc.\n\nthe story of gate pretty much starts out like this epic war between the Japanese army vs the empire which is totally not a cheep ripoff of the Roman Empire.\n\nWhich I thought was a pretty interesting idea for a war story. \nBecause you got modern combat with guns and tanks vs fantasy combat with magic and swords. Which would make some very interesting battles going down. And while this epic war is going down we will have people from both side trying to stop the war so the two worlds can coexist in peace.\n\nSounds pretty cool right? Well if you think that what the story like then I am sorry to tell you that gate is otaku pandering and Japanese propaganda to the max.\nAnd I am not jokeing when I say this.\nThe underline story is basically Japanese propaganda and otaku pandering.\n\nFor the otaku pandering part you got a fantasy world filled with most otaku fedish's like lolis,elfs,animal girls and etc.\n\nit also includes a main protagonist as an otaku who is a hero to the people and has been starting collecting girls for his haram. \nThere is also A lot of fan service.\n\nFor the Japanese propaganda part. \nYou got the leaders of America,China,Russia government acting like one dimensional evil villains who want to take over the fantasy world and mine it for natural resources for money or eta.\nWhile the noble Japanese government what to protect the fantasy people from those who would have evil intentions like America,China,Russia.\n\nAnother example of this propaganda is how normal Japanese soldiers where actually able to beat highly trained American blacks ops who probably have years of combat experience.\n\nI get it Japan your still salty about World War Two but you have to get over it,\nThe Japanese army isn't as strong as it used to be and you have to understand that.\n\nBut Also I would like to add that any country would probably do the same if a new land popped up and it was full of untapped resources and one county was just like no we call dibs on this.\nThis is global politics 101.\n\nBut apparently you can't have a war drama without all these \"important\" elements like otaku pandering and Japanese propaganda. \nActually it isn't a war drama is more like a war dud.\nBecause Who needs Gray morality or deep themes or good characters even.\nwhat the fuck is that? Take the safe rote and hope the plebs will bite and call it a master piece of mature writing which it really isn't.\n\nSo gate had the potential to be a good war drama and if it had taken it self seriously it would have Been good. But sadly it decided to Take the Safe route And becomes a soulless otaku pandering wish fill ment bull shit with a war thrown in as flavoring.\nAnd when I think about this could have been a pretty decent harem if it wasn't for the war and the badly explored politics.\nHell it could have been a decent adventure story if you again remove the war and politics.\n\nActually when I think about.\nthe war and political elements really do actually drag it down to the mud.\nBecause this could have been a fun story with harem and ecchi shit happening,\nAnd It would probably be a ten times better show.\nAnd that is saying something.\n\nCharacters, 4/10\n\nThe main character Itami is the most out of place thing in his setting. \nHe is pretty much an otaku with a pretty decent ranking the military. \nAnd I understand that anyone can have a hobby that's outside their work place.\nBut I would think if he was a soldier for the army he would be a lot more fit or in fact more highly trained.\nI know he not part of the black ops or any highly trained military.\nBut in all honesty he doesn't even act or feel like a soldier.\nBecause I have meet people that are or where part of the military in some point in there lives.\nAnd he doesn't have that vide about him.\nEven when I include other anime with military people in them.\n\nhis presence is probably the most jarring thing in this show.\n\nThe side character are very one note and are as bland as toast.\nAll the characters are spupind,\nEven the military leaders Who are In charge.\n\nThere not even a single character I care about in this entire show.\n\nThere is no character development or fleshing out. \nEven though there could be with the whole war thing.\nBecause war is very stressful and losing your friends or killing things can do things to people.\nSome it doesn't really affect them and others well PTSD is quite the popular way to go about things.\nNot one character say especially from the Japanese army \nWhat is this fighting actually actually doing to us or how do people feel when killing entire army's in mare seconds.\n\nThey feel like robots they just point, shot, repeat.\n\nBut in the flip side It more reasonable for the people from the fantasy world to act like that.\nBecause death and fighting are more common for them,\nEspecially When you make in the midevil fantasy world setting as context for that.\n\n\n\n\nArt, 6/10\n\nThe animation is very average as a whole.\nIt has some very colorful backgrounds.\nThe art style is very generic.\n\nI like some of the character designs,\nNot there not amazing or mind blowing in any way.\n\n\nSound, 5/10\n\nThe op I don't care about and the ending is probably the worse choice they could of picked for a ending song.\nBecause it so upbeat even though people are getting killed in mass in the show.\nIt doesn't fit very well.\n\nThe ost was fine for the most part.\nIt was done by yoshiaki Fujisawa.\n\nEnjoyment, 6/10\n\nSo over all despite being quite negative towards this show in general. I did quite find it quite entertaining at times.\nLike for example when the empire tried to attack the Japanese base and the empire army got recked almost instantly.\nWhich I fould funny because the empire army was so cocky and thinking they were going to win and then they get ripped apart by gun fire. \nThat was favorite part,\nIt got even better when they did it a few more times with a bigger army each time.\nAnd still got ripped apart easily.\nThose episodes are probably the most fun I ever had in this anime.\n\nAnd sadly it never go back to the quitly those episodes had \n\n\n\nOverall, 4/10\n\nIf you like simple shows with fan service and fantasy elements then gate is an anime you will like. But if your looking for a war drama that takes it's self seriously then you won't find it here along with over things like logic or gray characters.\n\nAlso if this was supposed to be some sort of advertisement for the Japanese army then it's a fail.\nEven as that."}, {"id": 2988, "score": 41, "body": "Warning this review contains spoilers.\nFirst impressions, so I am doing a review on an anime that is the top ten on my anime list at the moment what could possibly go wrong.\n\n\n\nStory, 3/10\n\nSo the story begins with this guy named satoru a falling mangaka.\nwho has the ability to time travel when ever some one dies near him and he is forced to save them unless he wants to live out a time loop for the rest of his life.\nSo one day while going to visit his mother or something like that he finds his mother dead and out of nowhere people see him covered in blood and see his mum dead body and now think he killed his mother Just before the police arrest him.\nhe is just magically transported 18 years back into the past,\nWhere during this time a string the children marders was happening, realized what's happened goes on a quest to solve the mystery behind these marders \n\nOk so this sounds good enough I mean we got some mystery shit going down with who is the person who is killing these kids and we got this we got to save these kids before they killed going on in the background.\nSo overall the story for eased sounds like a good idea on paper.\n\nThe story basically is him living out his younger years and befriending an abused girl who will become the first victim in this series of child killings.\nAnd him solving the mystery of who this child killer could be.\nWhich I thought overall the story was interesting and it has this sort of nostalgia feeling to it. \nBecause main character is getting the opportunity to live out his childhood years again and play dragon quest with his old friends.\n\n\nThe only positive I am going to say is that the mystery is interesting and they build it up very well and it's really sad that this is where the pros end.\nBecause time for the cons\n\nOne problem I had with this show is that the main character who has this time travel power with nothing explained why he has this power or if there are other people with powers like him. \nAnother problem I had with the whole time travel thing is that it kills all tension in the plot because when somethings bad happens he can just time reset and very thing goes back to normal. \nIt makes the drama that comes up in this show very cheap, forced and overall not engaging.\n\nOh yes speaking of drama.

I know the some children can be very smart and can pick up thing most people will miss but I don't believe that those characters are those type of children.\n\nAlso the Main bad guy was very disappointing as well I mean all that build up for that.\nAnd also the main character didn't even figure out who it was Because the killer just info dumped what he was doing and his evil plans to the main character.\nWho at the time didn't come to the proper conclusion to who the killer was like he was close but he still had other factors to think about before he reached the actual conclusion.\nIt like that thing in movies where the bad guys like info dump there plan to the good guys and then the good guys stop there plan.\n\n\nArt,7/10\n\nVery well done animtion.\nIt also fits the tone of the show with this Kind of dim color scheme and also the fact it also winter In The anime with makes it quite.\nThe background animation is fine as well it goes very well with the whole it's winter.\n\nThe character designs I quite like them.\nBecause the kids look like real kids.\n\nSound, 6/10\n\nThe opening is quite nice to listen to.\nBut it didn't really catch my interest but I still think that quite a few people could get some enjoyment out of it.\nThe ost is ok there are few parts that don't really fit with the whole tone of the show.\nThe ost was done by yuki kajiura who has done the ost for sword art online and fate zero.\nSub voice acting as ok-ish \n\nEnjoyment, 5/10\n\nSo the only thing I like about this show as the idea and the ost.\nother than that I thought that this show is over hyped and i also think it doesn't deserve to be on the top ten anime list on m.a.l or any site for the matter.\n\nOverall, 4/10\n\nSo if you want to see a good example of over hype and how it can destroy a show as a whole then this will be a good show for you to watch.\nIt also a good example of what not to do when your writing the story.\n\nIf you like mysteries or want to check out mystery shows.\nthen maybe esraed would be good one timer experience,\nBut other than that I couldn't really recommend it."}, {"id": 2990, "score": 40, "body": "Warning: this review contains spoilers.\n\nFirst impressions:\nSo, we got a mutant race of humans coming into existence, and humans are trying to kill them. Sounds interesting enough, what could go wrong?\n\nStory: 4/10\nElfen Lied is about a race of mutated humans called the diclonius, that instinctively kill humans and who are captured by the government and placed in a top secret base, to be experimented on. The main focus is an escapee diclonius named Lucy who gets shot in the head, causing her to have amnesia and a split personality called Nyu, who washes up on a shore, where she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s found and taken in by our primary protagonist, Kouta, together with his cousin.\n\nElfen Lied is trying to be this socio-political drama about the diclonius, who are discriminated against by humans, and are usually killed on sight. It does this by asking questions like \u00e2\u0080\u009cCan humans and diclonius co-exist?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre diclonius born to kill humans or is it because of human\u00e2\u0080\u0099s treatment of them, that they are the way they are?\u00e2\u0080\u009d. On paper, this sounds like a really interesting (if a bit tired) idea, but the problem is that the presentation and execution of this concept are very poor and lackluster, to say the least. This holds especially true because the ending doesn't even begin to answer the questions that are set up, and any hint of an answer is told very vaguely.\n\nThe story itself suffers from the biggest case of tonal-whiplash that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in quite a while. This is because even though this series is trying to be dark and serious, with its socio-political themes of society\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moral hypocrisy and alienation of out groups, it just doesn't really work, when it relies so much on cheap, emotionally-manipulative shock factor, instead of something of actual substance. An example of this is in a scene where a group of psychotic little kids beat a puppy to death, while grinning from ear to ear. Besides that, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got at least one fanservice scene in almost every chapter, some examples of which being the time Lucy/Nyu needs help getting dressed, the time(s) the main character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cousin wants to bang him and the time Lucy/Nyu gropes and makes out with people, just \u00e2\u0080\u0098cause. To top it all off, the plot becomes silly, in how dark and serious it's trying to be with the execution of its themes, all of which basically boil down to \u00e2\u0080\u009chumanity does fucked up things\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Now just to be clear, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind when manga take a more naturalistic approach with their storytelling. The problem with Elfen Lied, though, is that not only can it not pick an appropriate tone, both overall and in the individual scenes, but also that it goes so unnecessarily over the top, so that it just ends up coming across as cartoony and falling flat on its face.\n\nThe storyline itself is a whole other beast, which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll talk about now. I don't mind the slice-of-life moments, as they allow for some levity, but also give you the time to get to care about the characters, and actually feel bad for them when the shit hits the fan. I find it jarring, though, that it turns into a harem, because as the story continues, Kouta picks up a new loli or a new diclonius to live with him because [insert tragic reason here]. Also, there are some narrative choices that are so ridiculous, that I almost cry tears of laughter when reading them, because of how over-the-top they are. For example, when Lucy kills Kouta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father and sister, that was basically kick-started by a misunderstanding, because his cousin was getting a little too close to him, she decides she likes Kouta too, and goes yandere on his ass. I find that entire series of events funny as hell, and to add more to my comedy, it turns around and frames it as tragic, but to my mind, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just forced melodrama. This series\u00e2\u0080\u0099 tendency to force drama is only escalated when it turns out that Kouta and Lucy conveniently meet again years later, around the same time period when Lucy escapes and Kouta comes to live in the town where he and Lucy met and played together as children. It's there that Kouta conveniently doesn't remember what happened in his past, and Lucy conveniently exhibits the cognitive ability of a four year old. Did the planets just align for this one monument or is Kouta just a loli magnet? I can probably name a few more examples of in-series, off-screen godly intervention, for the sake of drama, but I digress. In all honestly though, if this were to happen in real life, it wouldn't surprise me in the slightest. The inhuman experiments, the double moral standards and the comically evil psychopaths in power; all of these are visible a mile away, yet this story showcases them like this is some sort of new concept that hasn't been explored before, even though it has been, but much better elsewhere.\n\nCharacters: 4/10\nOur lead protagonist, Kouta, is pretty much bland-as-toast, due to how passive he is. Even if personality-wise, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good, if not conflicted guy, he just isn't used to his full effect. This is rather bothersome, as he has major roles to play in the story. I like the fact that they tried to add more depth to him, by giving him some history with Lucy before the start of the main story, adding a good amount of conflicts stemming from that, later on in the story. At the end of the day though, it doesn't really amount to much in the grand scheme of things. It flip-flops between \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hate you\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cI love you\u00e2\u0080\u009d way too much, making it feel cheap, and I stopped caring after the first so many times. Fortunately, to balance out Kouta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blandness, we have our secondary protagonist, Lucy/Nyu, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little better written and offering a far greater level of intrigue than Kouta, besides the whole split personality thing. The thing that I find to be the most interesting about her is her inner conflict, as on the one hand, she hates humanity and has a natural instinct to kill all humans, but on the other hand, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also the part of her that just wants to live a peaceful life with Kouta and extras, despite her guilt towards him. This duality that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presented in her character is much more interesting than a one dimensional, sadistic attitude of \u00e2\u0080\u009ckill all humans, cause humans are bad, m\u00e2\u0080\u0099kay\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nThe side characters are just as bland and lacking in both depth and character development as the leads. The only characters that actually stood out for having something more to them were Nana and doctor Kurama. Nana, because she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of a few diclonius that are actually kept alive for experiments and has been stuck in a lab for most of her life, yet doesn't have any hostility towards humans, besides for self-defense. Even in those cases though, humans are generally still alive after the encounter, as she actively chooses to spare them, despite the fact that diclonius are supposed to instinctively want to kill humans. Relative to Nana though, doctor Kurama is an entirely different breed of interesting. On the outside, he seems like a very cold and cruel man, to humans and diclonius alike. Despite this though, he seems to have this very odd father-daughter relationship with Nana, even though his real biological daughter is another diclonius, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kept at the base. The main appeal of his character is his dual nature, where on the one hand, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll kill both humans and diclonius without a second thought, but on the other hand, will express clear feelings of affection (paternal, not romantic) towards Nana. This is exemplified when Nana was badly injured and was going to be put down for failing her mission, but he went out his way to help fix her up and even gave her massive amounts of money, to help her start a new life. His backstory was also pretty well done, as in it, he was presented with this very interesting moral dilemma, where he happened to find out his baby daughter was a diclonius. The result of this revelation was, of course, that he received an order from his superiors to kill his daughter, which made him heavily conflicted. On the one hand, his child would most likely be a threat to humanity, one day, but on the other hand, it was his baby daughter, who hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t harmed anyone. So to make a long story short, he tried to go through with it, but in the process his wife saw him and killed herself, but then his daughter ended up in the lab on the base where he works, and he is forced to live with guilt for his actions. On another note, the villains in this story are very cartoonishly evil, as they just do their thing, because they can. They're just evil for the sake of being evil and are used as a poor excuse to hammer in the message, which is that humans do fucked up things.\n\nArt: 5/10\nWhere do I begin with this? The artwork is really ugly and the backgrounds look really shitty. As for the artstyle, it has this moe/cartoony aesthetic that really doesn't fit with the dark tone of the series. The character designs are probably some of the ugliest things I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever had to look at, especially when it comes to the characters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 eyes. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re drawn huge, even by manga standards and look like they came from the anime for clannad, except without Kyoani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s standard high level of detail.\n\nEnjoyment: 6/10\nNow I know I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been somewhat negative about Elfen Lied throughout this review, but there are a few parts I liked. I liked the gory fights, where people get ripped apart and even some of the fan service, jarring as it was.\n\nOverall: 4/10\n\nConclusion:\nElfen Lied is a cluster fuck of ideas that by themselves are good, but which are badly implemented by an incompetent writer, who doesn't know how to use them to their full effect, and instead substitutes proper writing for cheap drama and shallow thematic development to get a rise out of people. That is Elfen Lied\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest trap, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main tactic, that it uses to get you to care and invest emotions in its narrative, that even I myself fell into it. Once you get off its emotional roller coaster though, and regain the use of your brain, you see it for what it is. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for a gore fest, then Elfen Lied is the manga for you. However, if you're not looking for a gore fest, then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be unimpressed by its poorly written characters and generally lazy writing. On the bright side, if you like this concept and wish it were executed better, then I recommend you read Parasyte or Ajin (or even Tokyo Ghoul, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve really exhausted all other options, and feel you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t live without more).\n\nSpecial credit to my unpaid and slightly pissed editor, Lonecrit."}, {"id": 3016, "score": 40, "body": "Warning this review may contain spoilers.\n\nFirst impressions, so one day while I was browsing a forum \nI came across a post that got my interest,\nAfter reading more into it I decided to check out the series they where talking about to see if it was worth reading because it seemed pretty interesting at first glance.\n\n\n\nStory, 4/10\n\nThe world has always been a Beautiful and ugly place,\nWhy it that,\nIs it the fault of humanity or is it just the natural order of things, we may never know the true answer to such a question,\nBut we can get close enough,\n\nSo instant bullet is a story about are main character fukase who is a loner who hates the world, on Christmas Eve he comes across a girl named sera a self proclaimed hero of justice who is chasing a mysterious creature that has been destroying things,\nAfter a few days of trying to find the creature,\nHe find out that fukase is actually a person known as an instant bullet a group of people who have been given great magical powers and that the creature was actually a power of his. \n\nSo after getting to meet some of the other instant bullets,\nHe is told that within 100 years the world will be destroyed by one of the instant bullets,\nSo by the sounds of this you think It's going to be this epic conflict of ideals,\nWhere one side is pointing out all the good things about humanity vs the other side which points out the bad side of humanity,\nWho is in the right, who in the wrong,\nNow that sounds pretty cool doesn't, \nAnd what dose it boil down to.\n\nA boring pissing Match between cynical teenagers with superpowers to see who going to save / destroy the world first,\nThough out the entire story it's pretty much,\nI am going to destroy the world,\nNo I am, well I going to save it ,\nWell I going to destroy all evil,\nNot if I do it first.\n\nWhile reading this excuse for a plot I am like.\nWhat's the point exactly,\nLike a know I am cynical asshole as well and \nI know that humanity dose fucked up things at times,\nIt's basically trying to tell us about the dark side of society and human nature,\nWhich is all well in good,\nBut when you only show one side of the coin,\nI can't take what it's saying seriously,\nWhich is funny because it treats itself so god dam seriously,\nWith it showing us all these fucked up things,\nWhich I really couldn't care less about.\nBut at the same time it dose offer the view point of those who are kind of outside of society in general,\nWhich is probably more interesting than watching a slice of life where everything is happy and fluffy.\n\n\n\nCharacters, 4/10\n\nThe main character fukase is your usual loner like protagonist,\nThere really isn't much to him,\nIt just basically a cynical teenager,\nWhich isn't bad per say because of his cynical nature it makes him more interesting to follow.\nBut by the standards of other characters of a similar nature he is very one note and also quite boring when you take out,\nThat part of his character.\n\n\nThe side characters of this little adventure,\nAre probably even more one note,\n\nBecause even though that have some interesting view points on things and are some want interesting in a simple way,\nBut They all have this one track mind,\nIt's like one extreme to the other with these characters.\nActually I wouldn't even call them characters \nThere more like mouthpieces for ideals,\nWhich isn't necessarily a bad thing,\nBut it like this one ideal defines there personality.\n\n\nArt, 6/10\n\nThe art work actually looks very nice,\nNothing ground breaking,but It was quite nice that some one at lest put effort into there artwork,\n\nThe back ground are actually done pretty well,\n\nIt has this very 90s cartoon style to it,\nWhich I quite like,\n\nThe characters designs are pretty standard fare.\n\n\n\nEnjoyment, 5/10\n\nI enjoyed this as a quick read manga,\nThat I don't really have to pay much attention to,\nPlus I really enjoy the fact that it is so short because if it wasn't I probably would have gave it a lower a score. \n\n\nOverall, 4/10\n\nIf your new to manga,\nThen I guess this would be a good manga to read and say to people hay I read this manga today,\nBasically just something to add you list of manga you have read.\n\nBut if your person who isn't into throw way manga,\nThen probably stay away,\nEspecially because even those kind of stories can be fun ht this is just plan old boreing.\n"}, {"id": 3018, "score": 47, "body": "Warning this review may contain spoilers.\n\nFirst impressions, so I was pretty hesitant to check this show out because of all the hype and hate that was around it so after a while I was like fuck it.\nI want to see want the people are buzzing about.\n\n\n\nStory, 4/10\n\nSo the story of re zero begans with subaru a neet who just doing his day to day things.\nWhen out of the blue for no reason at all he gets transported to a generic fantasy world.\nMan where haven't I heard this before.\nWhile exploring this new world he gets attacked by a group thugs but is saved by beautiful girl by the name of satella who is looking for her insignia that was just stolen from her \nDeciding to help her look for it\nIn thanks for her kindness in helping him with those thugs.\nEventually that mange to find where is and try and get it back.\nAfter finding where it is subaru and Stella are brutally murdered.\nThen subaru reawakens fine as rain.\nbut something is off he finds that events that happen before seem to repeating themselves, realizing that he gone back in time he going to try and stop the events and save satella from her death.\n\nSo the basic idea of this story is time resets and saving wifuus.\n\nNow I will be honest I do kind of have a personal beef with story's that use time resets\nAs a concept, \nLooking at you clanland after story and eased.\nNow Despite my distaste for these kinds of story's.\nI must admit that there is some actually good ideas in this story which kind of shocked me a little because I didn't expect much,\nAnd why should I from a story that has that as a gimmick\n\nSo the idea which I thought where good,\n\nWas the idea that every time the main character dies,\nHe try's to learn and use different ways to try and Solve the problem at hand.\nLike for example in The first arc he found out about the shop keeper and the thief girl and the person who killed him,\nHe wouldn't have known that unless he tried to find out what was going on.\nAnd i really like that kind of approach.\n\nThe other idea which I thought was pretty good,\nIs the idea of when the main character tries to do everything buy-himself like a good pro tag kun should,\nBut He gets slapped in the face by reality multiple times,\ntelling him that he can do quite a few things but some times there are things he can't do alone and that maybe he should get help.\nWhich was drilled into him quite hard when he was fighting the witches cult.\nBecause for the first 5 times he tried it by himself and failed,\nBut when he decided to get help it worked out better.\nAnd I really like that message because I have seen to many stories especially now a days that always has the protag kun doing pretty much everything like it requires no effort at all.\n\nBut sadly that doesn't mean that this is a master piece it's very far from it actually.\n\nBecause even though it has some good ideas here and there.\nThe rest of it ideas are pretty bland and there is just nothing really that note worthy where.\n\nAnother problem I have is that it always has to draw attention to sied good ideas like it done something that hasn't been done before,\nIt like small child trying to get your attention so it can show you the cool thing it did,\nLook at me look at this idea,\nI would have preferred if they let said ideas play out instead of contently drawing attention to that,\nFor example in the second arc,\nthey based the twins story arc on an old Japanese folk tale \nYet though out that entire arc it keeped on going back to it like you didn't get it the first time especially when they mention the story and tell it to you.\nWhich makes me quite sad because that was probably my favorite arc.\n\nBut I think my major criticism is that it takes itself so seriously and content wise it was anything but serious.\nBecause everything is done In such an over the top manner \nThat how could i take this seriously.\nLike when the show has these dramatic moments or dark parts,\nI am ether laughing my guts out or just cringing my teeth so hard my mouth was bleeding,\nEspecially when you have one arc centered around a mentally retarded joker and friends. \n\nI guess my final problem is that there is quite a lot of unanswered questions and plot points that need to rapped up,\nSo basically it's going to need that second season.\nLike for example why was the main character brought to this world or what is his connection to the which.\nI may never know,\nEspecially since I am to lazy to read the light novel right now.\n\n\n\nCharacters, 5/10\n\nThe Main character subaru is kind of this very average otaku person.\nWho happens be very prideful and kind of thinks that the fantasy world revolves around him.\nAnd in all honesty that all he got going for him pretty much.\nBut I really do like where they took his character,\nBecause at the start he was basically trying to be hero this knight of some sort,\nLike you good pro tag kun.\nBut as the situations get more intense and dire he finds that he can't actually handle it all by himself.\nEspecially when he brakes down.\nBut you don't just get that in an episode.\nBut he goes through this nice little development \nWhere he finally realized that he isn't that important and that he can do many things but do everything by himself is impossible.\n\n\nThe side characters for the most part where a fine cast of characters.\n\nFor me they did the roles they where given well,\nBut dose this mean they where good characters.\nYes and no.\nBecause on the one hand \nI feel that they do a good enough job and that there isn't really any characters I hated or found bothersome.\nBut at the same time there really isn't that much character development or fleshing,\nUnless you count the twins and Stella and the old sword guy I guess if we are talking about fleshing out.\n\nI also found all the bad guys really bad.\nThat where like a parody of actual good villains,\nBecause he have the crazy assassin,\nThe magic puppy and girl,\nAnd my personal favorite the joker mentally retarded inbreed bother in law.\n\nAlso rem is best girl and fuck every one else.\n\n\nArt, 6/10\n\nThe animation for this show actually looks quite nice,\nI do believe the background animation could have been done better,\nBut the animation dose shine very well when they do these dramatic scenes that look actually very nice.\nIt also uses a very wide range of colors which fits the moods that very scene dose.\nSo I guess you can say that the colors are pretty.\n\nIt has this very generic JRPG fantasy style to it which I don't really dislike,\nBut I wish that they would try something at lest different.\n\nThe characters design are kind of things that probably most of us has seen before,\nBut I do like the difference in all of them,\nSo it doesn't feel as generic as I should have.\n\n\nSound, 5/10\n\nBoth op and ending I found where all right,\nBut nothing really noteworthy for me at lest,\nI only liked the second op which I thought was quite nice to listen to.\n\nThe ost was on point and I think it's sounds alright.\nBut there really was nothing in there saying I want to listen to this again and again.\n\nLike if you looking for ost to listen to you should probably give this a shot,\nBecause there probably something that at lest some of you will like.\n\n\nEnjoyment, 6/10 \n\nI think what shocked me the most is how much fun I had with this show.\nI really liked the over all ride which was re zero,\nBecause I was never actually bored because I was laughing to much.\nI also found it fun to make theories to guess what will happen next and what not.\nAlso I really liked the thing about the witch,\nWhich is funny because that was the reason I was watching it \n\n\n\n\nOverall, 4/10\n\nIf you looking for a show that will entertain you and nothing more or you like show where you want to guess what's happening,\nThen Probably check this out \n\nBut if you some one who doesn't really like light novels or any of the eilk then probably stay away."}, {"id": 3019, "score": 46, "body": "Warning this review may contain spoilers.\n\nFirst impressions, so let's get back into my favorite train wreck anime \nAnd see what's that hook this time.\nWhat mystery and guns hmm this sounds interesting.\n\nAlso quick side note this review was made with the help of a few ideas that a Skype friend named zeph brought up.\n\nStory, 4/10\n\nSide note I am going to brake the story parts into arcs so i am going to talk about the story in detail arc by arc.\n\nfirst arc which I call the \n(The death gun menace)\nSo one year after the kirito Escaped and freed the people \nfrom the death game of Aincrad and the defeat of darth rape fairy.\nKirito and his girlfriend Asuna Decide in Taking some much needed \ndown time after There PTSD \ninducing adventure.\nBut while that is happening \na new evil is starting to take root that \nthreatens the balance of his \nHarem and video gaming life. \n\nSo Kirito is then called into action By the high gaming council.\nWho order for him \nTo investigate a string Of mysterious deaths\nOn a new game\nKnowing as gun gale online.\nThat seems to be \nCause by a mysterious \nPlayer named death gun \nWho has the power to kill you in real life.\nSo while investigating the incidents\nHe comes across a lone\nsniper named simon\nWho decides to help him On \nHis quest to bring down death gun or darth gun.\nAnd solve the mystery behind these deaths.\n\nSo the first arc pretty much try's to play out like some sort of video game \nmurder mystery with psychological\nelements with kirito getting the temptation to join the dark side with the whole Laughing Coffin incident\nwhich gets quickly rec-con and Simon back story where she killed a bank\nrobber which was played in probably the most hammy way possible.\n\nOne thing Which was kind of interesting in some way \nWas the whole mystery of is it possible to kill some one in a game without a real gun and is better writing wise because there was no Random time skips. \nAnd it was this arc that had the most going for it.\nIn turn of something of interest. \nLike with kirito being in a game where they use a different game mechanic with guns and not just fantasy swords and magic . \nWhich would have lead him to learn a new style of fighting or exploreing a new game mechanic, \nwouldn't it be more interesting to see kirito as a rookie learning how to use guns.\nThen why the fuck is he using A lightsaber in a game thats all about gun fights.\nI thought this game was called gun gale online,\nAnd the mystery element of the show pretty much solved it's self because kirito has actually meet death gun before and the only reason that he didn't solved the mystery quicker is that he forgot death game actual name.\nSo after defeating death gun.\nsimon is then welcomed into kirito harem club and the arc ends.\n\nSecond arc \n( attack of the really bad filler)\n\nSo a few months after the events of Gun gale online \n\nKirito finds out the location of a powerful Sword,\nHe then gatherers a small team in order to get \nBack a powerful sword known as Excalibur.\nAfter batting powerful monsters they then retrieve the Excalibur.\n\nAnd I am thinking to myself why those this arc exist exactly.\nI mean why dose kirito need Excalibur.\nHe doesn't need to get any stronger \nhe will win any way.\nIt doesn't Matter what sword he using.\nSo what's the point exactly of \nThis arc.\n\nThird arc \n(Revenge of the sick-th)\nSo while the winter break is going down \nVery one is chilling together in game and doing home work \nTogether because way the fuck not.\nAnd while that going down Asuna \nIs having problems with her home life\nWith her \"not one dimensional\" rich mother\n\nWho doesn't want her to marry into \npoor aka kirito even though he is smart and saved your child from the gay fairy rapist Because that's not good \nEnough.\n(free will and love what the fuck is \nThat if worse comes to \nWorse we could always \nMarry her to someone while \nShe in a coma like we did with that \nFirst guy that seemed to work)\nAnd is basically forcing Asuna \nTo meet all these quote on quote \nOf course not rapists.\nSo while this shit is going down Asuna comes across a powerful player \nWho is that leader of a group of Players that want To be the first To clear a boss room. \nSo I am like thinking to \nMyself. \nWell this is quite nice. It better the evil Mother crap We getting.\nOf course the show then\nDecided to take a turn for the \nWorse. So after they finish the boss.\nAnd the group sadly brakes up.\nWe find out that the leader of the \nGroup Has AIDS and is close to\nDeath and that the rest of her group \nAre also in the similar boat.\n\nSo basically this entire arc is this show \nPoor excuse to try and milk emotions \nOut of you.\nNow I know that some found this pretty \nSad and heart braking.\nBut I personally couldn't find a reason to care \nAbout any of these characters.\nAnd before you people in the comments say oh your so \nHeartless biogundam why don't you care.\nwell let me just say that for one \nHave been in a similar situation \nThat these characters have been in.\nAnd if they presented it properly then\nMaybe I could have cared a little \nAbout what was happening.\nBut what really bothers me about how \nThey did it. Is that is seems like that this was just Added in because they couldn't think up any more interesting storylines \nAt the time and so they just wrote it up this mallow\nDramatic bullshit \nAnd hoped that most people would bye into it. \nSo after the AIDS girl dies things go back to normal\nAnd that Asuna mother is now fine with her \nDating kirito.\n\nCharacters, 4/10\n\nSo the mian character kirito \nIs pretty generic \nhe is basically Jesus-kun.\nBut one thing which they tried \nWith his character which was kind of interesting\n\nWas for him to Get PTSD \nwhich he should have got last season.\nBut never mind he got in now.\nAnd what do they do with it.\nNothing \nbasically what happened is that he gets over his PTSD in about one episode.\nAnd then he back to kicking ass again.\nWait what shouldn't it take more than one episode to\nGet over PTSD. Well I am sorry but this is sword art online \nWhere one thing is bought up to be ended by the next episode.\n\nThe side characters are pretty basic.\nYet again. \nWith the old cast coming back \nAnd the only ones who seems to stand out was\n\nThe new characters\nSimon and the ADIS girl.\n\nThat where I wouldn't say better but I would say \nMore interesting.\nAnd they could have been even more interesting \nIf they where presented properly.\nAnd the quote on quote bad guy death gun was probably The most dispontment I have felt in my life when it comes to anime. Because they build him up as some sort of bad ass and then it turns out he is a rapist. \n\nArt, 7/10\nAnimation looks pretty nice.\nThe animation has a lot of polish it.\nNow there are a few inconsistencies \nHere and there.\n\n\nThere also some very good use of color scheme.\n\nThe art style is generic it's pretty much standard light novel fare.\nThe character designs are also pretty generic.\nI think that only thing that stood out was probably the \nDesigns because it was like a mix of post apocalyptic mixed with Japanese RPGs \n\nSound, 7/10 \n\nThe first op song and ending song where quite good and nice to \nListen to at least for me.\nI thought the second op and ending wasn't as good as the first op and ending \nIt just that the second op and ending didn't really click with me personally.\nBut I do think it worth a listen.\nThe ost was quite nice as well to listen to as well.\n\nEnjoyment, 6/10\n\nSo what I enjoyed about this show is pretty much what I liked about it in season one \nSo basically I enjoy the fight scenes even though it would have been nice to see more gun action instead of kirito using a lightsaber, but in retrospect it was pretty cool to watch \nHim flip around and do cool shit.\nI also enjoyed the ost. \nSo pretty much What I enjoyed about this show are all for superficial reasons.\n\nOverall, 4/10 \n\nSo if your looking for an anime and you just want entertainment them sword art online is for you. It is nothing more nothing less.\n\nBut if your looking for more than just entertainment then probably look for something else then."}, {"id": 3024, "score": 41, "body": "Warning this review may contain spoilers.\nFirst impressions:\nSo Black Bullet\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got monsters and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got people trapped in the walled off city.

Basically, there is a virus that turns people into monsters and what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s left of humanity is in a walled off city. \nSo one problem I had with this show right off the bat is the setting it takes place in. The world the story takes place in paints this epic picture of where humanity is close to extinction and every day is a fight for survival. There is a virus that turns people into monsters that are \"apparently \u00e2\u0080\u009c beyond human imagination because it seems that giant moths and spiders are apparently beyond human imagination, that kill other people.

Well if you have asked yourself that question then I will tell you. Because while watching this show I never saw any actual survival going on. Despite how the monsters are apparently this huge danger to humanity and have killed off most of the human population everything in this world seems to be like our world except for the virus that turns people into monster. What's left of the human race is now living in walled off city going about life like nothing ever changed. There are even schools and shops that are open that people go to. You are probably going to argue \u00e2\u0080\u009cwell the schools are there to train those you will fight the monsters right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Well if you thought that then I am sorry to tell you that you are wrong. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just normal schools. Because that's what we need in our post-apocalyptic setting\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 schools. So basically it is just another light novel version of a post apocalypse.\nAnother problem I had with this is show is that it couldn't seem to keep a consistent tone going. For example, the tone of this show seems to swing back and forth from dark and edgy, to school life to fan service with little girls- and yes you did read right. Fan service with little girls trying to get on the main character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s D.\nOne thing I did find funny was this shows attempt to be mature and taken seriously with the whole concept of super loli discrimination. Despite the reason for the super loli discrimination being very forced and seems only to be used for shock factor. It also is used to make the protagonist look like a hero who treats his super lolis with love and respect while the rest of society tries to kill them every chance they get, even though the only reason they are still alive is because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re super lolis. \nWait\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 so what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re telling me that these people are pretty much throwing away their only hope of survival? They must be very dumb to do that. I mean assume that these people were actually trying to survive, you would think that they would try and figure out exactly what would help them survive. It is like if an army person were to throw away his gun in the middle of a fire fight.\nBut of course we can't have actual good writing; rather, we have to make sure that these little girls are victims and suffer.\nNow If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re wondering about the actual storyline and what not, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty generic and unoriginal. It basically boils down to shit happens and main character has to fix it. And there is some sort of government conspiracy that you don't give a fuck about.\n\nCharacters 3/10:\nThe main character is pretty much a passive bland character that has nothing interesting and the only thing that makes him different from the rest of the character is that he is nice to his lolis and tries to make the world a better place for his super loli harem. Even though he not really trying that hard to do that.\nThe side characters are very bland and nothing interesting about. They are pretty much cardboard cutouts of light novel stereo types. Which aren't even that good any way.\n\nArt 6/10:\nNow, for the most part, the animation was fine. But this show had some very bad CG animated scenes. The backgrounds look pretty cool but that was about it.\n\nSound 4/10:\nThe OST for this is very forgetable. It's OP also rip-offs Attack on Titan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s OP, for some reason. The OST was done by Shiro Sagisu who worked on Attack on Titan, Berserk Golden Age movies, and Bleach.\n\nEnjoyment 4/10:\nThe only thing I enjoyed about it was the loli discrimination thing. This is like racism to lolis which I found quite funny at times. I am like \u00e2\u0080\u009coh this is racism towards lolis, I never thought that could happen but it did\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Despite the fact, that the reason for this was very forced and superficial.\n\nOverall 4/10:\nSo overall, if you are a loli-con or some kind of pedo then this is the anime for you. However, if you looking for a good post-apocalyptic show then you won't find it here."}, {"id": 3026, "score": 31, "body": "Warming this review may contain spoilers.\n\nFirst impressions, so my first thoughts where that is was one of those anime remakes of a classic manga and it's sounds some what interesting based of its primise. So I thought this would be one of those anti hero story's which I am a big fan of.\n\nStory, 3/10\n\nAre story begins with main character hayato who has come back to his home town of otomo city,Which have become home for a mysterious cult and other dodgey dealings.\nin order to investigate the mysterious the story's of monsters in the streets and a \nMysterious person known as the skull man who leaves a trail of body's in his wake.\n\n\nSo from what you can tell its one of those anti hero story's,\nWhich I am quite a big fan off.\n\nThe story in nut shell is main character is going around town looking for information about this skull man ,\nGets involved in shit that way over his head that involved some secret evil plan etc.\nThat pretty much the plot there really nothing much to it other than that,\nI mean I could go into detail but I don't think it worth the my time and yours if I am being honest here.\n\nBecause this is probably one of the most boring, done to death anti hero story I have ever seen in my life,\nIt's just so predictable and soulless.\n\nthere really isn't much I can actually comment on about it,\nThere no themes, no message it's trying to tell us. \nIt just mindless action, a pointless mystery that I don't care about, and boring drama that you couldn't pay me to care about in the slightest.\n\nIt's almost like when writing this they couldn't come up with any interesting or good ideas so they like hay good writing why do we need this,\nSo they probably decided to look up some sort of check list for how to make the most bland anti hero story ever,\nOk we got evil cults, mutants, political corruption, a generic moral protagonist, and last and not an bad guy who is a bad guy just because.\nLet's tick that of the list.\n\nAnd I know this is one of those re telling of a classic manga series or somethings along Those lines.\nAnd maybe that's why it kind of dated or bland,\nBut that's not an excuse for having a bad plot.\n\nLike one example of a retelling of a classic Franchise done right,\nIs Cassin sins which even if you didn't watch the original,\nIt still good even on its own and they actually used good and interesting ideas to mostly there full effect.\n\nSo bottom line that the main problem that no one gave a fuck about the story and everything else included as a whole,\nSo why should I waste my time or care about it.\n\n\n\nCharacter, 3/10\n\nMain character hayato is probably one of the most bland main characters I have ever seen.\nHis personality traits Are this,\nHe is just a good guy and that is literally his entire character.\nThere is Nothing interesting about him.\nHe pretty much the done to death mah morels type of character.\n\n\nSide characters,\nThey all have the personality of dry toast.\n\nJust like the main character there are bland as all fuck,\nNothing interesting or different about them.\n\nIt's just the one trait they have that makes up there there personality is there entire character.\nSo there not even characters there just cardboard cutouts.\n\nSo very bad characterization for the for the win I guess.\n\nAlso the skull man character himself Is also the most boring anti hero I have ever seen in my life.\n\n\nArt, 5/10\n\nProbably one of better things of this show.\n\nThe animation looks fine very passable,\nBack grounds are kind of average.\n\nVery boring fights that aren't animated well or have good fight choreography.\n\nThe style of the show which I would think try's capture this retro feel,\nBut Fails in that regard.\nI don't really now what it is,\nBut it just has this feeling of very stiff felling to it.\n\n\nCharacter designs are shit,\nAnd most of the characters look the fucking same,\nHalf the time I didn't even know who who half the time.\n\nBut I kind of liked the design for the skull man outfit,\nBecause it kind of cool to me.\n\nSound, 5/10 \n\nThe like the opening song,\nTh ending for me is kind of boreing.\n\nThe ost is kind of boreing as well,\nLike there really much I can actually comment on.\n\nVoice acting for the sub is fine.\nThere is no dub.\n\n\nEnjoyment, 3/10\n\nI enjoyed the op and that about it,\nLike a enjoyed a few of the fights.\n\nBut other that those things there really isn't much I could comment in the enjoyment sense of things.\n\nIt's just a very ber bones anime which doesn't have much going for it.\n\n\n\nOverall, 3/10\n\nIf your new to anime and you have nothing else to watch,\nThen don't watch this because it's not worth it.\nYou can find it what this show dose better else where.\nIf you like the skull man Franchise then maybe you would like it,\nBut I wouldn't hold my breath."}, {"id": 3042, "score": 42, "body": "Waring this review may contain spoilers \n\nFirst impressions, so today we are going to be reviewing the critical acclaimed magical girl deconstruction(TM) known as madoka magica which are clearly not an overrated and blotted piece of crap that not even a good art/ animation or soundtrack could save. \n\n\nStory,4/10\n\nSo our story begins with main character Madoka Kaname and side character Sayaka Miki are regular middle school girls with regular mundane lives, but all that changes when they encounter Kyuubey, magical creature, and Homura Akemi, the new transfer student. Kyuubey offers them a proposition for the girls to get into his van so he can grant any one of their wishes and in exchange, they will each become magical girls in order to fight beings known as witchs , However, Homura Akemi, a magical girl herself, urges them to reconsider has things are not so stright forward as they seem and to top it all off you have a another magical girl named Mami Tomoe an veteran magical girl who wishes for are duo to get into kyuubey van and desides to also mentor them to give them an idea of what there in for if they make a contract with kyuubey. \n\nSo madoka magica is a series that starts out like any other magical girl show.you got main character and her friends enjoying life until one day they encounter supernatural monsters and during this encounter, they meet a magical being that will grant them wishes or turn them into magical girls to combat the monsters and they have happy go lucky adventures and friendship power-ups a plenty. But what if I were to tell you that Madoka Magica is not just your tiple happy go lucky magical girl show because it is the fabled deconstration of magical girl genre, tropes, cliches by being dark, depressing and being edgy as fuck.\nbecause on the famous ep three one of the magical girls dies and from there onwards more death and despair will follow are cast of characters who maybe regret getting into kyuubey van without understanding the ramifications of there choices.\n\nSo the question I pose to you all is having these elements adequate to decent storytelling, well to answer your question I would say fuck no.\nBecause Madoka magicla takes the heart and soul of the magical girl genre and then preseeds to completely stomp on it with a heel until whats left is a soulless series that the faceless masses hype it up because its a deconstruction apparently and the premise sounds cool.\nBut being pedantic aside let us get into the real meat of this,\nSo on paper, Madoka Magica has some decent ideas and if the series wanted to go for a more darker, moodier magical girl story then they have hit the nail on the head perfectly with a few elements. Like for examples I will mention,\nas a magical girl you are basically immortal and your life is tied to your magic use and capacity, if you fall into despair and don't clean your soul gem you turn into a witch and my favourite element is magical girls fighting one another for hunting grounds.\nIf the series was just about that and focused on those elements alone then I would have totally been fine with this series and would have marked it up as a nice one-timer experience that I would want to visit again and appreciate for being different.\n\nBut the problem big underline problem with this series is that any good idea and concept it has, it completely drops it or forgets about it.\nBecuase who give a fuck about consistency and decent storytelling, as Madoka magicla devolves into an unnecessary dark, moody edgy magical girl show for the sake of being a dark, moody, edgy magical girl show.\nLike example killing off 90% of the characters by episode 8 in a 12 episode series or the whole reveal of how kyuubey is this alien who has no emotions and is using the magical girls and witches to gather energy to prevent the whole universe from going boom. Which the series uses as an excuse for over bloated drama about the characters complaining about how life is unfair even though they got there wishes grated that gave them some sort of happiness and their sacrifices are saving the lives of not just humanity as a whole but every race in the entire universe and it gets worse when kyuubey introduces pseudoscience in a supposed magical setting about entropy and emotions = magic wishes, how the fuck that works?\n\nanother pet peeve that really bothers me is how people count it as this amazing deconstruction of the magical girl genre and I feel that these people don't really know what a deconstruction is or even watched anything from the magical girl genre.\nTo be counted as a deconstruction you have to either be a subversion of popular tropes and cliches or be a critic of it and point out the trappings and pitfalls of that genre. madoka magicia doesn't really subvert or critic the genre in any meaningful way, it uses the whole magical girl element as an excuse for tragedy porn and shock factor. Which isn't really saying much because of it kiddle pool level of themes and theme exploration cause for a series that claims to be about hope and despair and how you should never give up regardless. Its so one sided to the point of silliness as life is never that linear and makes it lose any credibility.\nWhich is encapsulated with the ending of the show being a fucking time resect and Madoka becoming Deus ex Madoka because that's something you can wish for is to become a god? And use that power to fix the universe.\n\n\n\nCharacters,4/10\n\nWhen it comes to the main character Madoka, she is so bland and her personality can be boiled down to is that she a nice girl and what to help people.\nShe is such marry sue who I find so fucking boring and there isn't really a reason or Introspection of why she is like this. Like usually people who are like this are either people with a strong sense of justice or their people who have gone through such a hard time in life that they don't want others to suffer the same fate.\nYet there nothing to really imply she has a strong scene of justice or she had a hard time at life so she basically a bland soulless main character who only saving grace is the fact she the only one who wished for something useful which is to become a god.\n\nWhen it comes to the side charters and the magical girl characters themselves.\nThey are as about as soulless and bland as you can get with the one exception being Sayaka who was the only character who had actually any character instead of bland and vague outlines of personality and motives which helps me slightly care about her.\nBut in the grand scheme of things you cant care about charters you only know for a few episodes, which brings out my biggest problem is how this series handles its characters. Becuase this series kills off most of its cast before you even get to know them or most importantly get any character development which was very much needed as their characters are shallow.\nWhen a character dies in this show I view it as oh no another lifeless Puppet died big woop and I don't want to be that uncaring asshole but this show makes it so hard to give a fuck about its characters which also destroys the hook of the story as it's about trying to subvert the usual magical girl conventions.\n\nNow when to Kyuubi, he Is probably one of the worse characterisations of a creature that has no emotions and is supposed to be Neutral that I have ever seen in anime to date. Because he basically manipulates these girls and prays on there naivety to make a contact with him, and you argue that he gave them the choice, but that's bullshit because throughout the entire series he hangs around Madoka and Sayaka dropping these passive comments of how it would be great if they became magical girls and doesn't even inform them what they're signing up for with the excuse being that you have to ask, which is also bullshit again because the info dumps whenever the plot tells him to he clearly acting like Jafar here.\nTo add insult to injury he has the gall to criticize humanity for having emotions and reacting in a certain way when he himself has no emotions and wouldn't even understand the concept of emotions so is criticism is just blowing hot air and I would compare it to the idea of describing colours to a blind person.\n\n\nArt,7/10\n\nArt and animation are pretty decent and still hold up today and There are also decent backgrounds and fight scenes are well choreographed.\nAnother plus I would like to say about the backgrounds is that they do a good job at portraying this feeling of loneliness and isolation because a lot of the streets and buildings are barren and it encapsulates this feeling of backing yourself into a corner that you can't escape from it.\nBut one problem I have is that the witch realm is weirdly symbolic. But there isn't really any context behind it or reason why other than arthouse and pretty colours.\nBecause if witches where magical girls then why aren't their realm or forms-based more on there personality or psychology instead of being based on the areas they took residence in. It would have been cool if they did something similar to persona 4 or 5 wherein the tv world or the metaverse realms are based on a more twisted version of someone's personality and psyche, instead of its in a school or hospital and though out the entire thing we are going to bombard you with school and hospital symbolism.\nWhen it comes to character designs I quite like them, like the magical girl forms look pretty cool and the witches look very cool as well in there own arthouse way.\n\n\nSound, 7/10 \n\nOpening and ending song are both pretty decent and I would recommend people go and listen to them. Because I feel that fit the series very well like the opening song has this vibe of joy and regret to it and the ending song as this feeling of despair and the hope that there will be a better tomorrow.\nConsidering what happens in the series it fits the series like a glass slipper.\nNow when it comes to ost wise.\nI feel that the ost, in general, is lacking a lot of punch and is mainly used for the feels.\nWhich isn't a bad thing per say but I think its a waste to focus on the one emotional style. But that nitpick aside I still feel its worth a listen even if I am not the biggest fan of it. The ost was done and worked on by Yuki Kajiura the godless of ost of music and I feel that this soundtrack is probably the weaker of her works.\nSub and dub are pretty decent as voice acting was ok, but I did find the main character voice in dub painful to sit through, but other than that thumbs-ups all around.\n\n\n\nEnjoyment,5/10\n\nNow I know that I have been rough on this show throughout this entire review, but the only reason I am tough on series like this is that I expect more.\nWhen it comes to enjoyment I love as just a one-time experience and nothing else because Madoka magica is like roller coaster to me and once I got off the ride and thought about it my enjoyment went kinda downhill from there and what saddens me is it has some great ideas and there were parts that which truly entertained me \nbut once I got off the ride and seen the series for what it is that was the final nail in the coffin for me enjoyment wise.\n\n\n\nOverall, 4/10\n\nIn conclusion when you strip away the critical acclaim or the massive hype that this series has gathered. What Your pretty much left with a one-timer experience that mostly relies way too much on shock factor which in retrospect kills any rewatch value as the twists only work once. If you like really superficiality dark and edgy shows for pretentious overthinkers and edgelords in training Madoka will be the series for you. But if you're looking for a dark magical girl show with actual plot and charters your better of watching sailor moon or princess tutu\n"}, {"id": 3050, "score": 30, "body": "The outcome of a manga can almost be more important than the journey - but in this case, I couldn't even muster through the journey. Everything began quite clever - but ultimately turned into ridiculous plot twists, unanswered questions, and so much fan service that I had to double-check that this manga wasn't labeled \"ecchi\" (and frankly - I really should be sending an e-mail to \"MangaPanda\" and \"MyAnimeList\" to add \"ecchi\" as a genre). In fact, I'm surprised it's labeled \"shounen\" instead of \"seinin\" for this same reason.\n\nFor this manga, I've noticed that people who only read the first few chapters give good reviews - while most people who read farther, give bad ones. That is because this manga begins pretty decently, but quickly disappoints in ways I didn't even think it could.\n\nIf you want me to elaborate (spoiler-free) - see below.\n\nArt - 8\n\nThe art style isn't bad. It's not super-realistic, but it's also not super-cartoony. The artist knows what they're doing, and the art style used for the manga seems fairly mainstream and likeable. Good artist.\n\nStory - 5\nEnjoyment - 3\nCharacters - 3\n(all explained below)\n\nI would've given the story a lower score - but I'm trying to keep in mind that the series did BEGIN very clever. Many people being dragged into a dangerous game of life or death because of a social media app - it sounds cliche, but the writer managed to pull it off and make it fairly interesting and entertaining. The sections of the game were very well-written and strategic. It seemed genius, like the game was nothing but a battle of wits and the author was not afraid to do what he had to do to make it work. There may have been moments where the author showed a pessimistic view of human morality almost to the point of a lack of realism, but looking past that factor, the games themselves were decently thought up. Could this manga have taken a place in my top-5 favorites? Perhaps not - but nonetheless it was clever, entertaining, and interesting.\n\nHowever - it does not take long for the reader to get the sense that the author doesn't seem to care anymore. Characters - MAIN characters - seem to randomly disappear without another mention of their existence, and the whole tone of the manga changes. This also is very abrupt, so you'll know it's happening when you get there. To me, it felt as though the author was getting bored of writing the same characters over and over again, and so he made up an excuse to get them out of the picture and somehow replace them. It was to the point where I'm going through the pages waiting with baited breath for some characters to reappear (because of an unresolved cliffhanger) - and even after 30 chapters (each chapter is about 40 - 60 pages long, mind you), I'm still wondering if the author entirely forgot about them.\n\nOn top of that major flaw (which in itself was almost enough to make me stop caring about the story), things go from being based on intelligence, to seemingly being based on a lot of action - and as I mentioned above, the amount of fanservice shoots through the roof. In the beginning there may have been some things here and there that were a bit suggestive or inappropriate, but it was not too much more than the amount shown in other shounen manga. However, eventually it seems like they try to find more and more excuses to insert suggestive (and more than suggestive - outright visible) scenes with girls' bodies - and not even for good reasons. I recently read a scene where two female characters \"had to\" get naked, in order to carry out a plan, however that plan is actually physically impossible in reality - but the author makes it work anyway, and all just as an excuse to add naked girls. Recently it has felt common-place to see girls in skimpy bikini's, underwear, or just flat-out naked (and it seems they can only keep the 'shounen' tag because the important areas are simply not colored in, which makes it a bit less detailed.)\n\nWhile once or twice might be forgivable, it feels constant now - and that isn't what I came for. That was about the point that I dropped the manga, because it went from a \"psychological/shounen\" to an \"action/ecchi/seinin\" (with characters that are randomly gone and plot-twists that are ridiculous and make me care even less about the characters) - which I did not sign up for.\n\nOverall - I'm giving it a 30/100 (or 3/10).\n\nIt could've been lower had it not been for the beginning chapters which were fairly well-written. In the beginning it was very intelligent, and there was one twist in particular that I found extremely clever and interesting - but it doesn't matter, because after a while, the manga practically acts like the beginning never happened.\n\nThis manga heavily disappointed me. But if you like action and ecchi - this might be your manga once you get past the part where the author drops characters out of existence and changes the tone of the story."}, {"id": 3076, "score": 21, "body": "\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow can I become popular?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDarling in the FranXX is a sad attempt at creating or rather, replicating a legacy act. It took inspiration from what popular shows like Evangelion and Gurren Lagann did, without understanding a thing about what made them work. It tries to expand on ideas without understanding how to sell them, let alone incorporate them meaningfully. It wants to craft a setting to draw us in and make us remember it but instead, FranXX falls flat on its hormone-driven face. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a brilliant showcase on why the insular nature of anime writers & directors is detrimental. It is the definition of an anime that tries to pander to the entire anime community, and as a result, FranXX lost the chance to craft a work of art worthy of being remembered. What we have now is a vulgar yet ambitious mess whose only remarkable features are its volume of ineptitude and its interesting but horrendously executed aesthetic.\n\nSpeaking of which, what does FranXX\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sex aesthetic contribute to the narrative? Nothing good. Sure, every conflict deals with the idea of sex, gender, and couples in some way, but the visuals don't remotely contribute to this. Additionally, the world-building that stemmed from this is as questionably handled as it is derivative. Yes, Neon Genesis Evangelion did similar things, from the concept and world to having its mechs be drenched in symbolism. However, we get to what separates the two: humanity and focus.\n\nNeon Genesis Evangelion is one of the most human anime ever made. It constantly delves into the psyches of each character in a way that feels both relatable and real, while exploring their hobbies and how these people bounce off each other and affect each other personally. They were in the face of a war against deadly creatures, and the focus was placed on how this, their upbringing, and their conflicts stemming from this affect each other. This happened because Eva was written and directed by a legendary man and nerd who went outside, talked with people a lot and had a social life with them, and suffered through personal, relatable problems. The director and writer also had a sense of focus, making sure each world-building element made sense and retained consistency in the logic of the show, and that each character was consistent, with gradual mental declines that felt natural.\n\nNow, look at this show, made by someone who no doubt worked to get here but is as much an unknown figure as most other directors in this insular, borderline unsustainable industry. While he's capable of delving into his characters' upbringings, no one is written well enough for us to care. Part of why is because instead of relying on substantial interactions and meaningful introspections, FranXX takes the Re:Zero route of letting these autists shout their pathetically written and constructed feelings to each other Light Novel monologue style while letting flashy directing choices do the rest, often during contrived scenarios meant to incite drama with the most hideous of dialogue. To put this into perspective, episode 1 does this 5 or 6 times with its main character. Unlike say: Fate/Extra: Last Encore, this show isn't oozing with the kind of style to make it feel natural, instead only busting out the interesting presentation as a borderline disingenuous attempt at enhancing or explaining emotions. LE also delves into the introspection aspect far better and shows a superior portrayal of broken people raised by a horrible, controlling system that sends its inhabitants to fight for their lives. Additionally, it better demonstrates how that affects several of them once they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re out fighting and when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re part of the system. FranXX can't even make a compelling character to save its life, let alone a character that truly feels real. \n\nIf you're familiar with awful post-Eva works such as Brain Powerd or De;Vadasy, you may have found these problems all too familiar. Another common post-Eva trait is the ability to have a general idea of what to explore without any idea on how to make it work. Brain Powerd focused on trying to do the concepts and relationships of Eva backward and did so incoherently with a script to reflect that as they had to make up new terms and ideas out of nowhere that don't fit or make any sense. It decides to copy the actions of Evangelion and the narrative structure of Gurren Lagann while failing to create a coherent world with believable characters to care about. The disastrous second half more than cements this fact in several ways. \n\nI won't cover everything, but let's start at the top. The world-building in FranXX is among the worst I have ever seen, delving into its symbolism with little regard as to how it can make sense beyond vague setup, much like with the direction of the narrative as a whole. So much about the setting and lore counters itself, even outside of the parts that already make no sense. This anime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inability to show us the necessary information for certain events to have possibly taken place have resulted in monumental plot holes to make matters even worse. The FranXX mechs make no sense in literally any aspect, and the implications in them manage to assassinate the already badly executed relationship between Hiro and Zero Two. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not even mention how hideous the final 11 episodes were, especially in regards to FranXX's lore. Even then, the beginning was atrocious too, what with the awful love triangle, episodes 6 and 8, the aforementioned world-building, and the fact that most of the characters are obnoxious, worthless, needlessly hateful, and surprisingly inconsistent caricatures at best. The show has such little respect for them that its primary mascot character Zero Two, constantly switches on a dime simply for the sake of creating drama and steering the show in a planned direction.\n\nBefore we wrap up, we best look at the audiovisual side of things, as this show still manages to trip over itself in this regard, though it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do so as hard as it does with the writing. The fembot designs are all around the passable range with nothing being truly awesome or toy-worthy. The creatures and settings have nice colors but nothing is particularly well designed, from creature to character -with the possible exception of Zero Two-. Hiro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s design is especially awful for obvious reasons, and several of the supporting cast designs are eerily similar to certain Eva characters. The outfits are also mediocre to bad, often with awkward \u00e2\u0080\u009cX\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cY\u00e2\u0080\u009d logos for no good reason, and whenever the show tries to do something with dynamic cameras -sometimes even when they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t- the frames get cut in half, from a normal amount to what feels like half, if not less. The premiere episode alone is the perfect indicator. It thankfully doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen too often when it does, the viewing experience becomes a rough one. As mentioned, the directorial idea of messing with the aspect ratios haphazardly or for the sake of emotion and whatnot is borderline laughable as well. Additionally, there are several scenes where no one has any facial features, and the luckily infrequent CGI here is subpar at best. This collaboration between A-1 Pictures, Studio \u00e2\u0080\u009csaving anime\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trigger, and eventually, A-1\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new subsidiary, Cloverworks, was definitely shaky, even from a visual standpoint. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like the show was badly animated or anything, and the environments were done rather nicely. There were just several variables that kept this work from functioning greatly on a visual level. One last one to mention is how the fight scenes manage to be completely unexciting, with little real flow or impact to anything, or many truly good bits of animation or spectacle.\n\nIn regards to the music, none of the background tracks stick out, even if none are necessarily bad or ill-fitting -outside of one rap song at the start of episode 8-. There are some triumphant tracks in the first quarter that are good, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as far as that goes. The opening theme \"KISS OF DEATH\" by Mika Nakashima x Hyde, is certainly unique, even if not to my taste. The ending themes are all numerous, and none of them are particularly good or memorable. Sure, some are better songs than others, but none of them are really going to stick with you in the same vein that Gurren Lagann ED 2 or Neon Genesis Evangelion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ending themes did. Somehow, all of this makes the music the most competent part of the entire show, which is mortifying.\n\nThe most embarrassing thing is that the show not only tried its best to become popular, but it did so whilst having its staff being treated like shit by its \u00e2\u0080\u009cloyal fans\u00e2\u0080\u009d like it was the second coming of Re:Zero. There was ambition here but little thought beyond popularity and mimicry with a spin. One could argue this is propaganda for the Japanese to have kids and fix their under-population problem, but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly fix anything, or even help give the show any real identity. Such a shame since, again, the ideas present here, if given more thought, could have turned into a fun dystopian action show that explored its characters in interesting ways while being a meaningful allegory for sex and puberty. It isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like the show doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have its moments of sincerity or even a visible narrative through-line either, so the potential was obviously there. It's just that so much of what it did would require a complete and utter reworking in order to even become salvageable.

It shot for the stars, gave up halfway, and settled for firey Venus. It had a lofty goal of delivering a message to the audience about their habits, but amidst the laughable, self-indulgent torture of its main character and neat-looking \u00e2\u0080\u009cdirecting tricks\u00e2\u0080\u009d, it was too scared to commit. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s The Last Jedi of anime, except even worse. Both start off harmless enough but by the end divulge into a mess, except I resent this show more.\n\n So, what did Re:Zero attempt to tell us? To find out, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d need to understand the main protagonist. Wanna know why you hated him? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because he was meant to represent you, the entitled audience who escapes life by inserting yourself into fantasy. You who feels entitled to a 2D anime girl of your choice because you think you understand life and the scenarios of any given genre of fiction. He is an attack, a satire on the self-insert, as well as a twisted reflection of the audience, at least for 3/4 of the show. You see, after the infamous confession scene in episode 18, he stops being antagonized or treated as someone who just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get things. Now he suddenly is smarter and less desperate than he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ever been; now he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to get the girl and help defeat the enemies who caused him immense pain earlier. Now he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easier for you to insert yourselves into, and now he is suddenly cool with many of the people who felt disgusted or annoyed by him. He lost the one thing going for him, the one thing that made him better than the rest of the cast. He has now become the self-insert he was created to mock.\n\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say they did a remotely good job to begin with. For one, there are moments in which after the mildest of trial and error, he suddenly knows how to solve any given situation. Afterwards, everyone around him who hated or otherwise didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care much for him is suddenly cool, but on a smaller scale. Look no further than the end of the second arc, with the now iconic Rem turning from hating Subaru and wanting him dead, to loving him with the passion of a yandere, in the span of an episode, solely based on him helping her survive even when bleeding badly himself. I get that this is a noble action and that if you hated someone and he did that for you, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d likely rethink your position on that person, but Rem becomes an entirely different character in the span of one scene!\n\nThey do still give Subaru the most painful wake-up call in recent years, but often through contrived means that are poorly resolved. The payoff of Subaru realizing his mistakes, adapting, and improving never hits, as even with his blood sweat and tears, it's never truly earned. After the relentlessly awful gauntlet of middle episodes, after their insulting attempts at shaming Subaru through pathetic \u00e2\u0080\u009caesops\u00e2\u0080\u009d and punishments characters inflict that are contradictory to their nature, as well as one of the most horseshit plot ideas I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen with questionable existence-erasing gas, the show can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t handle it anymore! After all of the headache it put us through, it instead opts to play it as safe as all the Light Novels it went against!\n\nThis isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even going into other reasons why the writing crumbles faster than Subaru\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mental state, from the pathetic names of some of the enemies, to time loops in which certain events that could not possibly play differently or happen at all somehow do (episode 3 has one with a little girl Subaru and his girl Emilia helped out previously), or how people know the smell of the underlying threat of this series --Satella, the jealous witch-- despite how they never saw her or smelt her. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even bringing up the laughable excuse of a finale, the hideous fight sequences and CGI, or how horrendously defined the checkpoint system truly is. The lack of remotely decent side characters and character designs wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t taken into account either, though to add, the cast is less interesting than even SAO's, and the villain is laughably horrid. The merits regarding the opening/ending themes and some of the visuals were left off the table as well. This is ultimately a cursory glance at the show's mishandling of its promised message and themes rather than a holistic look at the show's folly. As it stands, Re:Zero was only remotely respectable in its initially shoddy mediocrity, not when it laughably abandoned all pretenses of bravado.\n\nCare to Re:Set for us, Re:ZERO?"}, {"id": 3083, "score": 20, "body": "Btooom is a seinen/psychological manga by author Junya inoue it is a manga in a battle royale like setting.

It is arguably the blandest, most forgettable installment in the Fate series, notable only for current memes and trends in the community, such as traps and the meme of lewding fictional characters, as well as for what it tried and failed to accomplish over the course of its run. Now before I delve into the review proper, allow me to answer some burning questions:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCan Fate/Apocrypha be watched as a standalone?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nYes, but I wouldn't recommend doing so, as you want to know the rules of the main Holy Grail Wars first that way you know how this deviates. It doesn't explain all of those rules either nor does it explain all of the new stuff it does despite some attempts. You should at least watch the main timeline installments to avoid possible confusion with this one. So no, do not make this your first, let alone only experience with Fate/ anime.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShould I watch Fate/Grand Order: First Order beforehand?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nNo. Pretend that abomination doesn't exist. It will not give you any insight into Apocrypha\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deviations either. All the entry does is cause confusion, not explain anything it adds or amends, and advertises a mobile game that contains all of the servants in the franchise.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm a guy. Is it gay if I like Astolfo as my waifu?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nYes it is and yes you are unless you're bi. Thankfully for you, he's bi too. Still, shame he is so convinced of a woman; I will never live down my shame of being turned on by him at first. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFate/Apocrypha, otherwise known by me as Fate/Steak Sauce, was animated primarily by Studio A-1 Pictures, and to be honest, I feel it may have utterly destroyed itself under its lofty ambitions in a variety of ways, resulting in a relatively dull mess full of improperly explained new mechanics, logical errors and holes, a cornucopia of characters that are as bloated as they are uninteresting to the point of even beating out last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s juggernaut dumpster fire Re:Zero, and lastly, arguably the worst production values ever given to a major A-1 Pictures show. It simply spread itself too thin, leading to a disappointment in nearly all aspects.\n\nBefore we really delve into why this show manages to be relatively disappointing in retrospect for me (as I was conditioned by footage and reception over the course of 23 weeks prior to my viewing of this failure to correctly assume this anime would be hovering around the subpar range at all times), how about we look at the one area Fate/Steak Sauce manages to somewhat excel in, that being the music. The composer, Masaru Yokoyama, did a rather decent job with the tracks present here such as its namesake track \u00e2\u0080\u009cFate/Apocrypha\u00e2\u0080\u009d, among a few other catchy and epic battle tracks. Some of these tracks are rather memorable, for right and wrong reasons. Simply put, these standout tracks get played way too much, particularly \u00e2\u0080\u009cFate/Apocrypha\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cJack the Ripper\u00e2\u0080\u009d, the latter of which plays in over \u00e2\u0085\u0094 of the scenes Jack the Ripper and her master, Reina RIkudou, are in. Another issue is that sometimes the music just gets cut off, and while that may work once in a blue moon like in episodes 6 and 17 when a character saves another from a deadly surprise attack, the rest of the time it comes off as sloppy and jarring. Nowhere is this more apparent than with the first OP, where it just cuts off instead of ending and lingering for half a second like it probably should.\n\nSpeaking of OPs, while OP1, \"Eiyuu Unmei no Uta (\u00e8\u008b\u00b1\u00e9\u009b\u0084 \u00e9\u0081\u008b\u00e5\u0091\u00bd\u00e3\u0081\u00ae\u00e8\u00a9\u00a9)\" is one of the weaker songs done by EGOIST, it is nonetheless as pretty good OP that works well given the nature of this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cGreat Holy Grail War\u00e2\u0080\u009d. OP 2, \"ASH\", is one of LiSA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strongest, rivaling, probably surpassing the band\u00e2\u0080\u0099s immensely popular SAO OP 1. This one feels like the perfect 2nd OP of a Light Novel action anime adaptation, which happens to be what LiSA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s songs are primarily used on with the likes of SAO, Mahouka, and Qualidea Code, and quite frankly, this is easily the catchiest LiSA OP to date for me. ED 1, \"D\u00c3\u00a9sir\" by GARNiDELiA, is a pretty decent track by this group as well, and of all the tracks I heard from her this year, this is arguably my favorite, but it certainly isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t among my favorites she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done. ED 2, \"KOE\" by ASCA, is absolutely astounding! If nothing else, Fate/Apocrypha has easily the best ED theme in the franchise to date, because this song is phenomenal, especially the full version! It fits perfectly for this kind of show as well in its 2nd cour too and the vocals are fantastic. I cannot wait to hear more songs from this group, and with this same studio releasing Grancrest Senki soon at the time of writing, I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to wait too long it seems.\n\nOf course, you cannot properly review an anime without taking the actual visuals into account and woo boy was it...rocky. For starters, it seems like A-1 Pictures tried their own spin on the Ufotable face and artstyle and it often doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work that well, however, it is at least better than their usual A-1 face (see SAO, Asterisk War, Aldnoah.Zero) or whatever fugly abomination the Eromanga art style was. They quite frequently look off, and I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t count the number of scenes where a character (or multiple characters) not horribly far from the foreground doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a face. There's also that time in episode 9 where Frankenstein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arms and face became a slinky and turned an emotional scene into unintentional hilarity. The CGI is brief here though sometimes it just looks egregious too (Saber plane from episode 19, anyone?). Hell, the character designs pail massively in comparison to those of Zero and F/SN by a mile. The outfits range from meh to absolutely hideous, with some of the worst offenders being Shakespeare and especially Siegfried, who is easily the worst designed character in the franchise to me. Everything about this design feels ugly and wrong, especially the armorless glowing chest. Other bad designs include Jack the Ripper, who is a little girl (or little girl body that happens to carry the spirits of a plethora of souls of unfortunate children) with an outfit that TV tropes would define as \u00e2\u0080\u009cstripperific\u00e2\u0080\u009d. \n\nThe fights are probably the most hit and miss aspect. Sometimes the fights look absolutely abysmal with ruthlessly horrendous choreography and shots that are entirely disconnected to the point of the fights becoming beyond incoherent and incomprehensible (see Karna vs Siegfried in episode 3). Not to mention that the frame rate of the fights can be immensely choppy, such as in the main fight of episode 21. Other times, however, many of the fights would actually become tolerable, if not downright wonderful to look at sometimes, such as anytime Karna busts out his fire moves starting from his fight with Vlad the Impaler in episode 8 and pretty much the entirety of episode 22 (yes, the art is less detailed but the animation is bombastic and dynamic, with absolutely wonderful looking flashy art and animation for the imaginative and stellar attacks and newly constructed environments). The actual choreography of nearly all melee is truly terrible, with some of the worst fights this studio has produced, but then we get those exemplary aforementioned examples on occasion and the fact that a lot of the time the flashy visuals are done effectively, and it all sorta averages out even, all things considered.\n\nThere are two interesting plotlines in this series, both of which directly involve the main characters, Sieg, Jeanne (and technically Leticia), Astolfo, Shishigo, and Mordred. Those are his journey of learning what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like to live and have freedom, and what it really means to be good and find salvation. Over the course of the series, this homunculus, with little knowledge of the world, asks these questions and becomes part of an overarching dialogue with these characters who ask the same and end up coming to their own conclusions of at least one of the two answers, with heartwarming and heartbreaking circumstances and great, terrible, and far more morally ambiguous people fueling or at least playing some influence on said answers, especially for Sieg. He tries to help other homunculi gain freedom just like a select few did for him, and by the end of the series, he comes to his own conclusions just in time to help someone he cares about regain resolve. This, in essence, is one of the two main, interweaving plots of Fate/Apocrypha. To be nice for a moment, Apocrypha does this admittedly well to a degree, and there are a few reasons for this. For one, Sieg starts off weak and with physically no developed personality, as some characters are quick to point out. While he does grow into a more archetypal character akin to what Shirou Emiya from Fate ends up reconstructing in UBW, it is still appreciated development, even if he grows little afterwards, only developing a sense of hate most of his contemporaries (with exception to, oddly enough, Kirito from Sword Art Online), never come close to exhibiting. Another reason this all works is that despite many of the characters not being that well written, more than \u00e2\u0085\u0093 of this sizeable cast plays a major role in his journey through these questions and his final decision towards the end of the series. This means, at least structurally, this all works fine and dandy to some extent, as there are many defining moments in the series for Sieg that influence him in a positive or negative way. There is one problem with the structure to be brought up later but even still, this all sounds pretty good, right? \n\nOh, if only...\n\nIf that were the case, this series would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve actually been rather poignant and compelling. For one, as mentioned earlier, not that many of the characters are actually well-written, as they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have that great of a chemistry with Sieg in the first place, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not interesting in their own right anyway. Given the immense size of this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character ensemble, with a grand total of over 30 characters in a 25 episode series with only 23 minutes per episode, inevitably only few would stand out as worthwhile characters. That is, of course, assuming that any character in such a cast was to do so at all, which is unfortunately not really the case here. Sure, thanks to a few spoiler-based reasons, we only actually need to follow around 24 of them. But that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still too many for such a series to handle. A lot of them are immensely forgettable in their own right, with a few such as Celenike and Atlanta becoming increasingly, crushingly terrible as the story went on. The main 5 mentioned earlier are the closest we get to well-written characters. This, along with the lack of time to really sell the drama related to some of the more minor characters, makes the deaths of some less emotionally impactful than the people behind this show wanted them to be, especially in the second half of the show, where the majority of the characters are killed. There are a few decent character dynamics such as Jack and Reina, Shishigo and Mordred, and Shakespeare and Semiramis, but not enough are explored well enough for me to truly feel for when some of these characters start dying. The best character is actually Sieg, who actually had to develop into a more archetypal character, which is immensely bizarre and interesting, even if, once again, he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t become that exemplary of a character. There is some nice banter between some of these characters but banter doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t automatically make ok at best characters suddenly good and compelling, despite the ambition and drama displayed with many, especially with the main antagonist. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll leave it at that though before I go too far. We still have one major subcategory of reasons the writing failed, that of course, being the narrative.\n\nTo avoid spoilers, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just say there are asspulls galore and many things that just appear out of nowhere only for them to appear from a portal the next time in an attempt to make up for not explaining anything beforehand and causing confusion. One of two nasty exceptions is what a certain female character acquires out of nowhere in episode 21, as there is no explanation as to how or where she got it. This instance actually gets somewhat repeated in episode 23 with a serum a certain important duo used to win a major fight. Everything related to Noble Phantasms is wrong, from the fact that they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t establish the amount one can have here, or the fact that there are legally many one can weird for some reason (they simply show it and only later do they explain after all the confusion caused). A certain character gets struck by the effects of a servant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Noble Phantasm in episode 10 that was effectively an electric suicide bomb, and then manages to use all of the noble phantasms the servant who accidentally zapped him with hers had, in episode 24. I understand that the holy grail war this time is different and that there are new rules created specifically for this spin-off entry, and they do a reasonable enough job explaining most of these. However, with instances like the above, they still managed to drop the ball. Sometimes the story claims that a character used more command seals than he or she actually did (or at the least, they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show all of them being used). Sometimes it seems like characters just teleport from one location at the end of an episode to another that was far away at the beginning of the next, in an instant (not including the times servants actually do). Other times, time seems to have passed by tremendously with nothing having happened during the fights whatsoever (especially in episode 3). I could keep going on, piling all the small details that really tear up the narrative from the inside, as the first half alone gave me 2 whole pages of errors and holes to list, but I think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll stop here. \n\nNeedless to say, I was a bit disappointed with this entry, not out of the fact that it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t meet initial expectations, as it kind of did, but because I saw the potential it ended up having, and found that in an effort to do so much, it failed to make the best out of much of anything. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even go over the fact that Sieg has a myriad of roles to play in such a short time, including being at the center of a love triangle with Astolfo and Jeanne. I could still list a ton of errors made in both halves, and try to more manually show how this series could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been better other than maybe suggesting an increase in length which would obliterate this series\u00e2\u0080\u0099 relatively decent pacing. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk about how surprisingly absent Leticia is, or even try to delve into this giant and subpar cast. However, I did expect this series to crumble underneath its own weight, and for what it's worth, it did surprise me at times, and leave me with some enjoyment, intentionally or otherwise. It did fail, miserably, both as a compelling narrative, and as an action series. \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSo, with all my negative views on it, and the fact that I advised against viewing it, I still didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try to spoil Fate/Apocrypha. For those of you who know how I operate, particularly with bad shows, this must be at least a little baffling. Well, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because for all intents and purposes, I really can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop anyone from watching it, especially given that it did some interesting things. Though, you shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect this to become very common. That said, Fate/Apocrypha is ultimately a sadly subpar entry, both in terms of its contemporaries, and in terms of an anime in its own right. It tried so hard and got so far, but as the lyrics go, in the end, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even matter. The fights range from great to terrible, and the narrative, for all it tries to tell and do, manages to be riddled with holes and other problems that prevent it from reaching its full, emotionally resonant effect. Barring its noble intentions and occasionally impressive fights, the only real saving grace for this anime is the music, which tends to get overplayed in this anime, unfortunately. It merely ended up like a Lancer in any other Fate/entry, out of luck and doomed to fail. So, goodbye Fate/Apocrypha, at least you tried your best, and sparked a new life with some current anime trends, for better or worse\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\nWith all that said, I bid you adieu."}, {"id": 3092, "score": 40, "body": "Is it a bird?

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a medium in which vigorously seems to try and go against societal norms; a medium not afraid to cover taboo or heavy topics such as incest or depression, and covers a myriad of different ideas and themes that if someone were looking for something incredibly specific from a piece of media, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d probably find their incredibly niche want within anime. This is the main reason why I choose to persist as much as I do within this medium, not only since I enjoy strange pieces of media to begin with, but also because I can get stories and concepts in anime that I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get anywhere else, such as Haibane Renmei and The Tatami Galaxy to just name a few. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m always looking out for something that is incredibly bizarre; something to fill that sensation I have to watch weird media, and the people over at MAPPA gave me what I was indeed looking for in the form of Inuyashiki (aka Flying Grandpa Simulator), a show in which a 58-year-old grandpa becomes a cyborg, with a multitude of different abilities, one of which being flight, as he becomes a vigilante of justice, protecting the weak, and curing people of their disease. Inuyashiki is a strange series and one in which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not quite sure where the writers were going with this story. For what I believe was supposed to be a moralistic battle against good and evil while presenting ideas of what it means to be human instead devolves into full-blown dumb shlock, and I loved every second of it! Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get me wrong, this show is bad. Quite bad in fact. But Inuyashiki has become one of my favourite guilty pleasures in anime with a concept and aesthetic so silly that I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take any of it seriously, even when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear I am supposed to at times. Allow me to elaborate:\n\nInuyashiki Ichirou, our senior male fantasy empowerment for this tale (laugh track at my totally original and clever joke) is not exactly having the greatest of times. Aside from looking much older than he actually is, his entire family resents him, for seemingly no reason. He has no affection for his wife, as they sleep in different rooms of the house, and his children also give him no time of day at all. To make matters worse, Inuyashiki receives unfortunate news that he has got terminal cancer, and, feeling that he can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell anybody about this, keeps it to himself, suffering in silence all the more than before. After a trip to the park to cry alone, suddenly, ALIENS! For no reason, and without any explanation at all, aliens accidentally kill both Inuyashiki and a man standing next to him, our main antagonist for this tale, Hiro (who just so happens to be standing next to him for some reason, but whatever). Realising their mistake, the aliens then rebuild both men, turning them into cyborgs in the process! While Inuyashiki uses his newly found powers for good, Hiro uses it for murder, as the rest of the series sees Hiro running from the police and becoming a bigger threat, with Inuyashiki trying to find him with the help of Andou, the once friend of our villain, who wishes to stop his murderous cyborg pal, leading to Inuyashiki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and Hiro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inevitable fight at the end.\n\nFlying Grandpa Simulator is fundamentally a tale of good versus evil, with each character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s respective ideologies being as basic as they come. Inuyashiki is the good guy, Hiro is the bad guy. While they do try and provide some introspection into Hiro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character and the reason why he kills (which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get into a little bit later in this review) this basic set-up is what allows Inuyashiki to be so damn senseless and fun! Flying Grandpa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s narrative is incredibly silly and over the top, but there was not a single moment in the entire show where I was bored and not laughing my ass off at how ridiculous the show could get at times, with the basic good versus evil narrative providing an amusing framework for all the stupid shit that happens in the show. This acted as an incentive for me to keep watching, just to see what the writer would think up next, and he never failed to entertain me on that front. The show is constantly trying to one-up itself every step of the way, with the narrative becoming more and more cheesy and ludicrous as it goes along, with Hiro proclaiming that he will kill everyone in Japan and even beginning to see through on this proclamation as he takes to the city buildings, and from there, kills hundreds with his finger banging, being the icing on the schlock-filled cake! The anime is all over the place, and the pacing, in particular, is so fast, that it actually works in favour of the show from an entertainment standpoint. One moment we see Inuyashiki flying through the skies accompanied by silly cartoon slapstick music, and then the very next episode we see him infiltrate a yakuza hideout, blind every single person there, and leave completely shirtless (not to mention that in the start of that very same episode, a Yakuza boss walks into a sauna completely naked and forces another guy to give him fellatio!)\n\nEven just all the little strange details the show includes makes it so enjoyable to watch as a piece of shlock for me. Such as is the case of the cyborg bodies of both Inuyashiki and Hiro. Not only is the prospect of seeing an old shirtless man flying through the air one that cracks me up, but the fact that this body, which was created by aliens, includes a USB port under one of the fingernails in order to connect it to an iPhone is such a stupid thing to include, that I burst out laughing when it happened! I guess Aliens also use USBs to connect their iphones to various other devices too?!\n\nHowever, we still haven't got to my favourite element of the cyborg bodies: finger banging! By just simply forming their fingers into the shape of a gun, much like a kid back when I used to play when I was like six-years-old, and then shouting \u00e2\u0080\u009cBANG\u00e2\u0080\u009d they fire off an invisible bullet of sorts, or, in Hiro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case, using his entire arm to mimic a machine gun while screaming \u00e2\u0080\u009cDADADADADADA\u00e2\u0080\u009d when firing at a bunch of reporters. Just the idea of comparing Hiro playing with guns to that of a child is one that I found so hilarious, but it ultimately falls in line with Hiro's ideology and mindset; he too, thinks in the same rationality as a child would, so it does make sense within the context of his character to act as such.\n\nInuyashiki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s narrative is comparable to that of a cheesy science fiction and seems to almost revel in that fact. However, there were some elements and ideas present here, that were actually not completely schlocky, that I thought were kind of interesting. Take, for example, where Hiro hijacks people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s phones and TV screens in order to murder them. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing great, sure, but I liked this idea since it meant that the killer could appear anywhere, at any time, striking people when they are at their most vulnerable, which added a whole new dimension of tension to those scenes in which Hiro goes on a rampage. It's an interesting concept to take a device which is so engraved in our everyday lives and present it as the biggest threat to our survival. However, despite as such, I would be lying if I said that much of my own enjoyment for Inuyashiki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s narrative is indicative of the schlock and stupid premise, which, while entertaining to watch to kill some time, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t offer much besides that. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the type of show to watch drunk or high to get the most out of. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for something that comments on the true nature of what it means to be human with themes of existentialism and the such, then you will find no such thing here.\n\nMuch of your level of enjoyment of this show stems from whether you enjoy watching bad schlock, and if you can just turn your brain off (since, when you begin to think about each of the world-building elements and ideas then your brain will hurt since nothing makes any logical sense) and just watch all the stupid carnage unfold before your eyes. I had a blast watching Inuyashiki, clearly, and I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worthy of praise if a show can be entertaining, even if that show is indeed bad, but that still doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t excuse all the poor writing the show seems to thrive in and the multitude of problems it has. One of the most prolific, and the one that would probably put people off from watching the show altogether is the strange tonal shifts the show has, going from goofy hijinks with an old man attempting to fly, to the straight up murdering of young children and babies. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the second episode of the show, which shifts to the point of view of Hiro, our antagonist, something the show does rather frequently during its run. At the end of this episode, Hiro walks into a random stranger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house, and murders everyone inside, including a small child who is sitting inside a bathtub, as his father cries and pleas for his life, but Hiro finger bangs him regardless. This surprised a lot of people who were not familiar with the manga, including me, since it came so far out of left field, and the show has quite a number of these moments. The killing of children comes across as rather tasteless and a pathetic attempt to seem edgier than it actually is; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essentially shock factor, which reminded me a lot of Elfen Lied, albeit nowhere near as extreme as that show, which tried to hide behind a veil of being deep and mature. Inuyashiki has an air of dumb fun, and seems to almost partake in making fun of how ridiculous it can be at some points in the show, to the point where it feels that the original writer had just as much fun writing this insane story as I had consuming it. Although, there were a few moments in the show in which I believe were supposed to make the viewer feel sad, or perhaps tense, regarding those moments were people are killed, but I was having just as much fun with those scenes as I would any other in the show, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this strange juxtaposition of what I believe the writer intended an audience to feel, and what I felt, that makes any serious moment fall apart in the show.\n\nThe anime also has this strange tendency to randomly cut to a character who has no bearing on the overall plot at all, such as a working woman with terminal cancer or a woman on a plane visiting her family. This comes across as jarring and bizarre since the characters are completely inconsequential to the plot, and the show spends a good five to ten minutes on each respective character; it feels like needless padding just for the sake of such. While it does make sense in one or two instances, such as in episode four where we are introduced to two characters who are linked directly to the plot of that episode, which is what triggers Inuyashiki to go and infiltrate that Yakuza hideout I talked about a moment ago, most of the time it just feels worthless, and if it were cut entirely, nothing would be affected. I suppose the point of these random digressions in the narrative is to showcase what the public is thinking and to gain an insight into how Inuyashiki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts are saving people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lives, but it still feels unnecessary. The ending for the show too, while I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get into specific details about it, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly the greatest in the world either, and may leave you feeling somewhat irritated as a result, although it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t personally annoy as much as it did with others.\n\nThe characters of Flying Grandpa Simulator are probably the weakest part of the series and feel more so like one-dimensional cardboard cut-outs than actual fleshed out people. First of all, there is Inuyashiki, our protagonist of this tale; a weak and timid old man who, despite working full time to support his family, receives no love or affection for all his hard work. All of Inuyashiki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family are just so cruel to this poor old man, for seemingly no reason at all! While it is implied that Inuyashiki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son resents his father because he is being bullied at school because of his poor family income, he still treats his father as if he were a stranger! Perhaps it can be excused since he is young, and being bullied or something along those lines, but his resentment towards his father just comes across more as trite and forced, to manipulate the audience into feeling sympathetic towards Inuyashiki. The show does try to explore the history behind Inuyashiki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter, however, Mari, whereupon we see that as a kid Mari cared for her father dearly, following him about everywhere and crying that he would pass away soon since he looked far older than he was. However, as she grew into adolescence, Inuyashiki explains to Andou that he has not spoken with his own daughter for years now, as she seems to actively try and avoid him at all costs, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never explained why she does this, nor why she holds resentment towards her father. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of implied that she is trying to prove something to him, that being that she wants to draw manga, but the show doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give any clear insight into why she dislikes her father as much as she does, making her feel more like a one-dimensional twat if anything else. While in the penultimate episode of the show she does once again begin to love her father as before, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not really any build-up to this event, aside from one moment in which Inuyashiki, in a conversation with Mari and her mother about her future, says that she should be allowed to pursue what she wishes, that is, drawing manga, or the few scenes where she was following her father around as he cured the sick in various hospitals, but her sudden change regarding her opinion of her father comes so far out from left field and feels jarring as a result.\n\nI expected a bulk on Inuyashiki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character arc to be centred around him growing in confidence with this new found body and sorting out the various issues with the rest of his family, but that never really happens, nor is any justification given into why his family dislikes him as much as they do. While, certainly, Inuyashiki himself does seem to grow in his confidence, as he finally finds purpose in his life, and a reason for why he was born in the first place, as evident by his monologue in the penultimate episode in which he goes from person to person saving their lives, or healing them from their wounds, in a scene that actually had some heart to it, I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say his character is anything substantial or even close to good. He simply represents the human side of the two newly-created cyborgs and that is it. Speaking of such, this leads me to the next character, Hiro, the antagonist of the series, and the representation of the loss of humanity when one becomes a cyborg. Hiro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character, and the arc he embarks on (or lack thereof) centres around his loss in humanity, as he has to kill others in order to feel human once again, childishly playing a game to determine which house he will enter next to slaughter those who lay within it. Hiro is just a complete psychopath with no emotions or empathy, asking women if they enjoy One Piece while their entire family has been killed! While the show does try and convey this theme of what it truly means to be human regarding Hiro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character, it falls flat on its face since it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heavily implied that Hiro was a complete psychopath even before becoming a cyborg, as we learn that as a child he killed small animals and the such. This completely negates all the attempts the narrative has to present Hiro as a victim of circumstance; as a victim of losing his own humanity which acted as the justification he had for killing people, and makes all the moments in the show in which he is breaking down and crying over someone he loved feel all the more ridiculous, as I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel any sympathy towards someone who kills children! His character has no chance to reflect on the misdeeds he has done in the past, nor do we really get a chance to delve into the psychological implications his murdering is having on himself, which just makes him feel more so like a psychotic murderer and nothing else. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe this is inherently a bad thing, and it works in the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favour regarding its shlock value as I mentioned before, but it makes Hiro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character uninteresting. Simply put, he is the bad guy and must be stopped. Nothing more. Nothing less.\n\nThe rest of the characters in the show are either just one-dimensional assholes, such as a group of kids in the very first episode who fire fireworks at some poor homeless man, a group of thugs, who, when told they shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t push in front of the line for a taxi by a middle-aged businessman, then escort said man to a park twenty minutes away just to beat the hell out of him because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just that EVIL, or random kids making fun of a woman with cancer just to make her all the more miserable, or they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re absolute dumbasses! Every person in the world of Inuyashiki is so damn dumb that I wonder how they even know how to properly breathe! Okay, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first discuss Shion, who, after the news is revealed that Hiro is a murderer, and is thus on the run from the police, allows Hiro to stay with her and her Grandmother in her house as a means of protecting and hiding him since she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe he would do such a thing. But, this makes no sense as there is no reason for Shion to believe that he isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a murderer as she knows nothing about him! To her, he is just a fellow classmate, and the only interaction that she has ever had with him was one case where she asked for Hiro to go out with her, confessing her feelings in the process, whereupon he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks\u00e2\u0080\u009d and walked away. There is nothing to suggest otherwise that he is not the killer, and it always annoyed me how na\u00c3\u00afve she was in letting, essentially what is a stranger, inside her home! Her character, as well as that of her Grandma, are used mainly as a means for Hiro to learn to love people once again, and giving him some kind of reason and drive to fight to protect them, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s handled poorly.\n\nBut, compared to the entire Japanese police force, Shion is a goddamn mensa student. The police force, for whatever reason, are incapable of tracking down one single person, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like Hiro stays inside Shion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s place all the time either. He comes and goes rather frequently, and, in one instance, leaves just to murder some reporters before flying back! With all this travelling, and considering that he is one of the most wanted men in the area, why did it take so long for the police to hunt him down? Even more so when there are hundreds of goddam surveillance cameras all over the place too; surely, they must have been able to catch him on camera or something? Additionally, when Hiro begins his crusade to murder every person in Japan, he takes to the buildings and kills 100 people there and then, before issuing a warning to the rest of Japan that the following day he will kill 1,000. However, despite this massive threat, and proving that he has the means to be able to pull it off, nobody seems to even care! The very next day, despite commenting that there are fewer people out, most people are still working and walking about the area where all those people were murdered, but above all, most people are still using their phones! It was established in the previous attack that Hiro can kill you through a smartphone, or any other device with a screen on it, and here we have idiots walking around with their phones still! Do they actually want to die?! Also, why are the police not doing anything to find Hiro? Like, clearly, he was snipping people with his finger banging from high up on buildings, but where are the helicopter surveilling each building to try and find this guy? Even more so when we learn that he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even move from his location and just spent the night sleeping on top of the same roof he killed everyone from the day before! What are the police even doing?! One final thing I want to rant about really quick is how each woman in the show, most particularly teenage girls, refer to Hiro as being \u00e2\u0080\u009chot\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009ccool\u00e2\u0080\u009d so much so that there have been several fan groups made about him, and when one girl, during the massacre of 100 people sees Hiro appear on her phone, she blushes and acts like a dumbass instead of being fearful for her life! Why is Hiro being idolised? This is the guy who murdered babies for crying out loud! While the show does too seem to question this, as evident by a couple of police officers who are discussing this fact, this element always bugged me, and I groaned to myself whenever a girl would comment about how \u00e2\u0080\u009chot\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hiro was.\n\nUnfortunately, Flying Grandpa Simulator suffers from poor production values too, and while most of the character designs are fine by themselves, in motion, when the use of CGI is used, it can look pretty choppy. The CGI contrasts awkwardly with that of the traditional 2D animation, intermixing both within the same scene haphazardly, sometimes utilising CGI just for walking animation, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incredibly inconsistent to bat. At best, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t too bad, and the CGI wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t obtrusive enough to really pull me out of the show, but at its worst, the CGI models can look hideous! Inuyashiki is far from the worst looking thing I have ever seen, but I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s particularly good either. As for most of the music in the show, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rather forgettable, barring one slapstick piece, that I remember above everything else since it was used bizarrely in a scene that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fit the tone of the piece; a scene in which Inuyashiki has to stop several planes from crashing into the city to prevent hundreds of deaths! It feels pretty jarring and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work at all. The OP and ED tracks, however, are both excellent! The OP is perhaps one of my favourite opening tracks for any anime, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve listened to it on repeat while writing this review for hours now, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get enough of it. It hypes me up so much, and is so goddamn catchy that I love it! By contrast, the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ED takes on a much more sombre and melancholic tone, reflecting the attempted relationship between that of Hiro and Shion, and is also a wonderful piece of music in its own right.\n\nIn conclusion, Inuyashiki is a bad show; one that is bogged down with poor writing, idiotic characters and mediocre production values, but I loved every second of it! It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pure dumb shlock on every level, with a premise that I enjoyed due to just how silly it was. But, at the same time, this makes Inuyashiki hard to recommend to people since, as I said before, your level of enjoyment with this show is dependant on whether you enjoy shlock, and if this premise is one that you may enjoy as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cso bad that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good title\u00e2\u0080\u009d. As it stands, however, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bring myself to hate this show, despite how poor it actually is, since it brought me nothing but enjoyment, and while I am disappointed on some level with this show, as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard amazing things about the original source material, this show is certainly a better one than MAPPA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s previous effort, Bukkakegurui, a show that not only was bad but also boring! Inuyashiki, in my opinion, is the good type of bad show. The type, that despite still being indeed bad, is still able to make an entertaining show despite that. With all that said and done, and finally ending my longest review yet, I thank you for taking the time to read this and, who knows\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 maybe your grandpa is also a cyborg too!\n"}, {"id": 3095, "score": 40, "body": "*******\nHe appears to be on top of the world. Boasting a picturesque cleft chin, surrounded by a legion of followers that fervently scream his name and a trio of women that lovingly caress his shoulders, this man seems to be the center of attention, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not only aware of this but he enjoys it as well. This man is Lucky Roulette, the ringleader of a gang known as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cWild Bunch\u00e2\u0080\u009d. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a nasty assortment of thugs, mugging, murdering and inflaming anyone or anything that obstructs their path to riches and renown. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cWild Bunch\u00e2\u0080\u009d migrate from one town to the next, mercilessly pillaging the inhabitants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 resources before moving to the next locale. Their acts of destruction are all overseen by Lucky, who views each undertaking as an opportunity to assess how much luck he possesses.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the one thing in God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s domain. No training to it. No honing of one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skills. Nothing. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why I want to test it. I want to find out just what God thinks of me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d - Lucky\n\nTo that end, he endeavors into each heist without abandon, which simultaneously endangers his life and pushes the boundaries of his good fortune. Cackling maniacally, twirling his pair of revolvers, Lucky obliterates everything in his line of sight and, through pure luck, he finishes with nary a scratch on him. Because of this, Lucky feels as though he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not only fortunate but exceptional as well. He believes that no matter what activity he partakes in, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s guaranteed to succeed because of his luck. However, it is when Lucky begins terrorizing the small town of Evergreen and encounters a hopeless drifter named Vahn that everything changes for him.\n\nWhen Lucky learns that Vahn injured a few of his members during one of their raids, he coerces Vahn into playing a simple card game with him as a method of uncovering how talented Vahn is. In the middle of this game, he promises Vahn that no harm will come to him if he wins. Lucky also claims through a lengthy monologue that attacking Vahn would contradict his personal code of honor, stating that he only engages in fair fights. However, when Lucky loses the card game, he reneges on the promise he made. Valuing his good fortune above all else, Lucky believes that, during the card game, Vahn deprived him of what he cherishes most. As a result, he ambushes Vahn in a dark alley and drenches him with steaming hot lead, which not only triggers his ultimate downfall but also tarnishes the moral principles he claimed to protect.\n\nLucky Roulette\u00e2\u0080\u0099s characterization is a blatant argument against the concept of an honorable criminal. He discourses at great length on righteousness, claiming to support his moral code, but when circumstances demand he prove where his loyalties lie, he abandons his beliefs. Stripped of his noble platitudes, Lucky is your typical bandit, just as petty, self-absorbed and shortsighted as his peers (if not more so). Lucky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proclamations of honor only serve to emphasize the extents his hypocrisy reach, which makes him all the more fascinating to watch during his brief appearance in Gun x Sword.\n\nIn the context of this show and what it aims to accomplish, Lucky Roulette is but a one-off villain, defeated in its very first episode, never seen (nor referred to) again; he is a pawn, unwittingly participating in a scheme far bigger than he could ever fathom. Lucky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role is minor, yes, but it does carry some level of significance. With each episode, Gun x Sword would burrow further and further into the concept of an honorable criminal, exploring the nuances of this idea through various individuals (each with their own unique moral code), before ultimately confronting it via its main antagonist (who is arguably the most complex \u00e2\u0080\u009chonorable criminal\u00e2\u0080\u009d of them all). However, this thematic exploration all begins with Lucky and his card games. Honestly, the fact that Gun x Sword created such an insignificant character and used him to establish the groundwork for one of its most essential concepts speaks volumes about the level of writing we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re dealing with here.\n\n*******\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult not to marvel at the scope of this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vision. Gun x Sword (GxS) is ambitious, an anime aiming to integrate a myriad of themes and concepts into a narrative that seamlessly transitions from episodic, small-scale events to a far larger plotline (what GxS accomplishes with the idea of an honorable criminal is but one of many feats its storytelling achieves). During this transition, it ceaselessly diversifies the intent of its individual vignettes, each episode (unique in its own right) serving as an experiment for GxS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall purpose. While one episode is a Pulp Fiction parody, another is a high-stakes mecha tournament. This is an anime that can dedicate one episode to elaborating on the dangers of childhood nostalgia and an entirely different episode to waxing poetic on the merits of bathing suits. It is this wondrously creative writing that highlights the adventures of Gun x Sword\u00e2\u0080\u0099s protagonists Wendy and Vahn.\n\nEstablished on the Earth-like planet known as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEndless Illusion\u00e2\u0080\u009d, GxS is an anime that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s partially defined by its scenic backgrounds, by its gorgeous fight scenes, and by its devastating plot twists but what guides all of this forward are the motives of this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s central characters. Wendy is an insecure yet assertive young girl, an individual whose arc is focused on retrieving her older brother Michael from the clutches of The Claw (GxS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main antagonist), alongside surviving and maturing in a world that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t favor her small stature. Vahn is the stereotypical anti-hero, a poor man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Spike Spiegel that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pursuing The Claw because he murdered his wife at their wedding three years before this show takes place (as a memento, Vahn still wears the tuxedo from that day).\n\nTogether, Wendy, Vahn and their motives are the foundation for Gun x Sword, and all that it aspires to do. They are also the nucleus of an anime that prioritizes its ambitions far too often for its own good.\n\nWith its wings stretched behind it and its chest puffed out in front of it, Gun x Sword is Icarus, grasping the heavens above but ignoring virtually everything outside of its line of sight. This show propels its narrative (and the multitude of ideas embedded within it) into increasingly innovative directions but, in the process, it mishandles and (at times) neglects more than a few impactful plot elements. Focused on the bigger picture, Gun x Sword doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t apply the same attention to the smaller pieces of the puzzle.\n\nThis show is one that attempts juggling several concepts at once but, though this pursuit is admirable, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always succeed. While it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s understandable that GxS struggles under this workload, the degree to which this show fumbles with some of its ideas is, at times, baffling. For starters, there is a certain subplot involving a watchdog and its two puppies that exudes the stench of a halfhearted effort. Gun x Sword tries positioning these characters as devices for an overarching message on the human condition but it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t dedicate enough time to properly develop this idea and the result is naturally less than ideal. Then, there are the unsettling implications contained within the dynamic between Wendy (who is in her early teens) and Vahn (who is in his mid-twenties) that Gun x Sword never bothers exploring.\n\nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect this show to present a detailed opinion on underaged relationships but, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to portray your protagonists with a considerable age difference as a couple (and, dear God, is GxS guilty of this), then a comment or two on how you feel about this topic shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be too much to ask for. Naturally, there are other concepts that GxS fails to flesh out in one way or another (of particular interest is episode 14\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tragically underdeveloped viewpoint of mass-produced machines) but, in the grand scheme of things, they (and the deficiencies I mentioned earlier) are inessential. When examined individually, that might not appear to be the case. However, in the context of all that Gun x Sword represents and accomplishes, their importance is downsized considerably. What this show forfeits on a conceptual level by botching several of the themes it tackles, it more than compensates by emphasizing its force of personality.\n\nGun x Sword has quite the theatrical flair. This show doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t merely advance its plot lines to thrilling peaks; it revels in those dramatic highs. GxS throws itself wholeheartedly into exploiting each and every twist and turn its story takes for maximum effect. The result is a show whose overdramatic approach is simply irresistible to watch. And for something like this, it requires a soundtrack that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worthy of its efforts. GxS needs a soundtrack that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just as gloriously over-the-top as it is, a soundtrack that not only complements the tone of this series but elevates its theatrics to new heights.\n\nLuckily, Kotaro Nakagawa, famed composer of the soundtracks for Code Geass and Planetes (among others), is here to make this possible.\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s his experience with creating uniquely cinematic scores that allows GxS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s music to flourish. Primarily reliant on a combination of orchestral and jazz, this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s score is highlighted by the intensity of its sound. Nakagawa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s saxophone riffs awaken with the fervor of a firework display while his violin solos roar with a Hans Zimmer-esque self-importance but GxS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s score really shines in his efforts with Hitomi Kuroishi. A frequent collaborator on Nakagawa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s projects (and a musician I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve long admired), Kuroishi provides her harp, her drums and (of course) her angelic voice to this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soundtrack with her songs \u00e2\u0080\u009cParadiso\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cLa Speranza\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nAs awe-inspiring as the songs created by Nakagawa and Kuroishi are, it is Gun x Sword\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opening theme that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s truly the pinnacle of its musical brilliance. Backed by a symphony of trumpets and drums, it is a series of climaxes, energetically transitioning from one to the next. It is also a marriage between flute solos and background vocals. Last but not least, it is an opportunity for Gun x Sword\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supporting cast to be properly introduced.\n\nIn the opening theme, they are nothing more than silhouettes. However, in the viewpoint of first impressions, they seem to be nothing more than plot devices; they appear to be mouthpieces masquerading as characters (and not very talented mouthpieces, at that). Every message GxS conveys through its supporting cast makes for an unappetizing watch. Shallow at its best and heavy-handed at its worst, this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s social commentary is one that not only offers nothing new to the issues it discusses but it also pushes to the forefront a rather limited perspective. When its characters state their opinions on topics like ageism, classism, and sexism, their efforts betray a lack of knowledge on the subject matter.\n\nAs more exposure is provided to the supporting cast, these individuals are allowed opportunities to deviate from their mouthpiece roles and to distinguish themselves. While this show falters in communicating social themes through its supporting cast, it shines in developing their personalities. With the benefit of a different approach in place, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apparent that these characters are more than tools for GxS to employ however it desires; they are people striving to preserve their beliefs and fulfill their ambitions. Enhanced by these intensely personal characteristics, the supporting cast is rendered human, which ultimately makes investing in their individual journeys far easier.\n\nThe supporting cast truly is a collection of fascinating characters, which consists of (but certainly isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t limited to) Ray Lundgren (an enigmatic loner with a scathingly cold demeanor), Michael Garrett (a deconstruction of the shonen protagonist), Joshua Lundgren (a mechanic whose inferiority complex is played for laughs), and Priscilla (a confident tomboy that compensates a lack of intelligence with her zeal). Each of them is solidified as characters through their willingness to defend their beliefs and ways of life. As a result, the fights that occur in GxS aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t merely exchanges of blows. They are philosophical conflicts, sprung to life by the determination of each combatant and their reliance on their principles. Not only does this cause the supporting cast to be all the more enjoyable but it also adds a layer of nuance to this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall theme of revenge.\n\nA hero falls victim to devastating circumstances, resulting in the deprivation of everything he/she ever cherished. However, instead of succumbing to sorrow, the hero uses their most vulnerable moment as the driving force to settle the score with the cause of their despair. Revenge is a concept that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s both exceptionally alluring... and exceptionally narrow.\n\nIn comparison to ideas such as love, power, and prosperity (which are broad and abstract concepts that can be defined however you wish), revenge is specific and concrete, which severely limits the extent to which you can explore it. To its credit, Gun x Sword provides a valiant effort. Through Ray Lundgren and Vahn, this show not only dissects the idea of revenge but how it consumes individuals, alongside those around them and (in the end) it questions the benefit that results from revenge. However, where GxS ultimately falters isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in its thematic exploration but in the conclusion it reaches after its analysis.\n\n(A useful aside: It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impossible to overstate how important revenge is to Gun x Sword as a whole. It isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t merely among the many themes this show builds upon. Revenge is THE theme of GxS, the concept that everything else revolves around. Vahn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pursuit of revenge allows him to encounter Lucky Roulette (and Wendy) in the town of Evergreen, which causes this series to move forward. Without the idea of revenge, none of what GxS accomplishes (and wants to accomplish) would be possible)\n\nRevenge for its own sake is not unique, nor is it entertaining. There must be a deeper meaning to the motive if you really want people to be invested in your character. For Ray, a man whose wife was murdered because she remained loyal to her principles, revenge is only part of what he desires. In pursuing his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s killer, Ray wants to uncover whether or not the choice she made was correct. For Vahn, however, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s different. You see, after all of the time Gun x Sword devotes to questioning the purpose behind Vahn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pursuit, the answer it reaches is the equivalent of a shoulder shrug.\n\nBy not providing any depth for Vahn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motive, this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s development of the idea of revenge is a half-finished effort. If this flawed thematic exploration were an isolated incident, it would be quite difficult (but not impossible) to properly appreciate everything else GxS has to offer. However, factoring in the other underdeveloped concepts that are scattered throughout this show, the various pieces of the puzzle that (by themselves) seem insignificant, results in something too devastating to overlook. Gun x Sword leans far more towards style than it does substance; this is an anime that amazes with the outlandish ideas it raises but underwhelms with how little it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s willing to develop them. It promotes itself as something of a thinking man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shonen/mecha but its efforts in justifying this title are inconsistent, to say the least.\n\nI admire Gun x Sword. No; it would be more accurate to say that I admire what Gun x Sword could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been. With its joyously overdramatic approach, its experimental narrative, and the overwhelming ambitions it aimed to fulfill, who can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t appreciate the heights this show wanted to reach? When it involves potential, few can compare to GxS. However, when it involves realizing and maximizing that same potential, this show ultimately falls short."}, {"id": 3096, "score": 49, "body": "Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody seems almost as perfunctory as anime gets, as if to be the self-appointed embodiment of \u00e2\u0080\u009canime today, 2018\u00e2\u0080\u009d, but with some sense of restraint, much to the relief of some. By that same token, it manages to actually somewhat succeed at being incredibly basic (temporarily), because sadly, it's hard to find a show that can pull this off. Giving the finger to SAO, Re:Zero, and Isekai wa Smartphone, this is Death March\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brief time in the limelight. \n\nI'm sure that at least some who are aware of my outlook on a variety of shows of Death March's ilk are recognizing me as daft for even glancing at this show's general direction. However, the intention goes far beyond having an excuse to malign another anime. Put it simply, I want to prove the existence of a hierarchy.\n\nEvery genre, and every category of entertainment has a relative and not entirely subjective hierarchy consisting of installments that are better than most, worse than the rest, or are somewhere within a grey area of sorts. Even the harem show has undisputedly better installments such as Ouran High School Host Club, and irrefutably awful ones as well, such as Isekai wa Smartphone. The school battle anime typically goes with the comparison of Chivalry of a Failed Knight to The Asterisk War for such a comparison. While some shows that are more commonly considered to be in the middle are treated like the worst of their kind, it wouldn't be fair to label them as such. Even genericism can be executed swimmingly or horrifyingly. As for where this show stands in the isekai totem pole...well, an important enemy from episode 1 somehow died offscreen in the beginning of episode 2; this anime isn't exactly the savior anyone here is asking for.\n\nSlamming aside, this show isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have bad. In fact at times it can be decent, even good. For example, the first 12 minutes are actually pretty great. We were shown a horrifyingly real depiction of the Japanese work industries, with people often staying for hours upon hours at their job, falling asleep there out of sheer exhaustion, not coming home for days at a time, and the workload being asinine. The directing by Shin Onima helps sell how dreary it all is, with incredibly harsh lights shining when the protagonist sits on a train to get to work in his sleepy state, and how silent everything is in the workplace in regards to background music until we transition into the primary setting of this anime. Hell, even when the surprisingly likable MC is transported to said game world setting (don't ask me how, this never makes sense no matter which anime pulls it, and most don't even explain themselves in some way), it still feels oppressive. When he first enters the game, we get to see Sato immediately become at least somewhat disillusioned with the idea of this being an ideal \u00e2\u0080\u009cdream\u00e2\u0080\u009d when he is attacked and writing with pain while bleeding, in a scene somewhat reminiscent of some of the better moments of Re:Zero\u00e2\u0080\u0099s early portions. \n\nFrom there, it becomes a bit more hit and miss. While some aspects of the game make no sense (why would need allow your character to learn language comprehension?), they did think about stuff like currency, tax, and the overall economics and societal rules in a simple and effective manner, unlike the convoluted and meaningless currency in say, Smartphone, that never gets brought up after the first instance. It somehow manages to be a pleasant watch at times, notably because of the main character, the constant music that blends in perfectly, and the occasionally pleasant misadventures Satou and his posse go through, and the surprisingly passable world-building. Sometimes, the show can feel dull and blas\u00c3\u00a9, needlessly so. It doesn't help that the show does sink into some of the more loathsome temptations of its maligned brethren on occasion. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s annoying to see such practices continue since we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come so used to the absolute bottom-tier dreck these kinds or anime shit out souleslly while removing anything they seemingly had in their LN counterpart (see Mahouka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main character as a known example of this). It does this further as it goes along too, as if the reviled temptation is increasingly heinous for them to resist. Due to this, the bare minimum of what should be considered acceptable can almost be seen as nigh-revolutionary. This really is like the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctriple-A game industry\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nA large part of why this series works is Satou, our main character. On the surface, he seems like the run-of-the-mill insert, especially based on his appearance. Admittedly his reactions would be rather typical. However, he certainly isn't an awkward buffoon who only has a spine when the chips are down like most of in contemporaries do, and a majority of the time, we actually see what he thinks about any given situation. It's actually rather amusing to hear him gush over every intricacy of his meals or react negatively to whatever bullshit someone gives him. Additionally, the main character often has to use his surroundings to adapt to new situations (with ease, but still, it's something) using strategies he comes up with in the fly with party members. The fact that we get to see actual strategies being employed when facing an enemy in say, a dungeon, is surprisingly not that common in MMORPG anime, if Sword Art Online has taught us anything. Him looking like Kirito in the early episodes of his show and being better at MMORPG culture and strategy than him makes him all the more glorious, especially when unlike nearly every other overpowered protagonist, he actually has a semblance of variety to his powers. To add on to how much of a cheeky fuck he is, when he wants to rename a female companion, he just translates their garbage name in Japanese, expecting no one to notice. The only real issue I have with him is that he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother leveling up his skills until the need for a specific skill becomes relevant for the first time. One could say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so that he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t become boring and absurdly overpowered, but if he can do this already, and if he is already at level 310 by the end of the first episode when by the time we are \u00e2\u0085\u0094 into the series, the highest leveled opponent has been level 50, then this excuse can no longer fly. That, and how he can get dull over time, though not by too much.\n\nThe main character can't carry such an annoyingly dull cast, however, as most of his posse feel less like dynamic characters, and more like largely distinct accessories for him. Obviously he doesn't feel this way about them, but as established, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s certainly less of an audience surrogate than many of his ilk. They're thankfully nowhere near as obnoxious as most female harem characters, as none of them quite fit into the tired archetypes of harem characters, and each character is distinct from one another, unlike Smartphone, where most of the women are lately the same character. Not to mention that while not every female Satou collects is in love with him, it increases every so often, threatening to turn this pseudo-harem into an actual harem with leftovers. Arisa can get grating sometimes with her bullshit, making her probably the worst of the lukewarm bunch (aside from that one demon in episodes 3 and 4, whose voice was a spell meant to poison the ears), side-characters included. A majority of the villains are borderline worthless husks meant to serve as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cstandard evil prick\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Understandably this takes place in a video game but the antagonists really are just the Light Novel adaptation standard when they didn't entirely have to be. At least the villain in the second arc has some pretty decent and interestingly foreshadowed motivations.\n\nEasily the worst part, however, would be the production values. Even outside of the nice directing moments present in episode 1, and how they purposely instead sunlight saturation in certain moments of episode 2 to accentuate the wonder Satou feels about this new world he is in, there isn't much flare to speak of. The character designs looks rather sharp, possibly too sharp, though improved over the original novel. Thankfully it isn't the LN standard but it's still not that pretty to look at. The action is not very well animated either and the magic spells aren't with any sense of flare like they would be in Konosuba or Knight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s & Magic. As mentioned earlier, there are some neat directing moments sprinkled throughout, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all they are: moments. Not all episodes even have those brief moments, and coupled together with terrible, sometimes even laughable action sequences, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s certainly little better than the rest of Death March\u00e2\u0080\u0099s borderline pitiful visual presentation. \n\nI'm more than willing to believe that the 2D aspects were studio Silver Link and that the rest is Connect, given their repertoire and how Connect has never done a solo project. I say this because the CGI bears massive simulators to another joint project of theirs: Chaos Dragon. Thankfully there is no frame rate slow-down, aside from the CGI already having bad frame rates as is, but the CGI is both disturbingly prevalent and disconcertingly awful, with most soldiers being reduced to CGI armor models that look putrid, and many creatures being reduced to unintentional abominations due to the same hideous 3D model quality. Regardless, this show looks terrible and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t move well. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a shame that somehow it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the production values that hold a light novel anime back more than anything else, as if this anime wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a bewildering rarity already.\n\nThe music is mixed as well, though it is conversely the best aspect of the show. The Opening, \"Slide Ride (\u00e3\u0082\u00b9\u00e3\u0083\u00a9\u00e3\u0082\u00a4\u00e3\u0083\u0089\u00e3\u0083\u00a9\u00e3\u0082\u00a4\u00e3\u0083\u0089)\" by Run Girls, Run!, is a real good contender for \u00e2\u0080\u009cmost generic-sounding anime OP\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and needless to say, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very pleasing to listen to. The Ending theme, \"Suki no Skill (\u00e3\u0082\u00b9\u00e3\u0082\u00ad\u00e3\u0083\u008e\u00e3\u0082\u00b9\u00e3\u0082\u00ad\u00e3\u0083\u00ab)\" by Wake Up, Girls! Isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much better, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another ending theme that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t noteworthy. The rest of the music is pretty decent, feeling like it truly belongs in a fantasy video game. This only applies when the characters are in the villages and not elsewhere. One minor jingle in particular even opts to make you feel like you've discovered or done something grand, and if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one thing video game scores are fantastic at, it's giving off a sense of grandeur. The track pool even expands in the second half when things try to get more serious and full of dread and tension. There are some nice emotional tracks too, like the one in the penultimate scene of episode 9, and the episode 10 ending track, which sadly cannot be named at the time of writing. Such a shame that the opening and ending themes that sandwich these tracks are what hold the audio component back.\n\nUltimately, in a world where perfunctory is revolutionary, you can forgive the disproportionate applause at least once, as even mediocrity of this kind, in such a location, can inspire hope for the future of Isekai, garbage visuals aside. There are some genuinely nice moments, visually, and emotionally, so to see it settle is annoying at times. At the very least, if something like Isekai wa Smartphone was up the alley, this is worth viewing too, that way you find an infinitely superior product with a trick or two up its nonexistent sleeves. For now at least, I can say Death March thankfully didn't live up to its title in terms of viewing experience, awful finale notwithstanding, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surprisingly high up on this totem pole. Not bad for a modern LN Isekai title. It may not be good, but, well, baby steps.\n\nAlso, the fact that people are treating this show like an endorsement of slavery is woefully disconcerting; please don't do what you tried going with Mahoutsukai no Yome."}, {"id": 3100, "score": 30, "body": "I wasn't planning to watch this anime, but I had read the manga a long time ago and really enjoyed it. For those unaware, the story is about an amnesiac ghost who wants to figure out how she died while falling in love with the boy who is trying to help her. I thought it would be an easy nostalgic watch.\n\nAnd it was... for one episode. The pilot is an anime original that introduces us to Yuuko, Kirie, Okonogi and Niiya as well as the overall tone of the anime in a way that was unique and refreshing for a ghost show- even if half of it was the same thing but with Yuuko's layer unmasked. If there's one reason to watch this show, it's this. \n\nBecause it's in the following episodes that I started seeing the issues with this show. Instead of rolling with the pilot that already introduced us to the main cast, we're treated to forty minutes of what are in fact flashbacks of the club members meeting each other. While this information is useful and necessary, it could've absolutely been made in one episode or cut entirely- I'm looking at you Okonogi.\n\nEpisodes 5-7 are full of fanservice, romance and characters being cute with a moderate focus on the actual plot. It was passable if you ignore Okonogi, who suddenly thinks this is a harem and keeps asking out Niiya, who accepts almost every time even when he knows Yuuko gets jealous. We're also introduced to Shadow Yuuko, or the other Yuuko, a hateful version of Yuuko. \n\nThe real pain starts at episode 9, where the spoilers begin. The only reason I wouldn't recommend you read them is to read the manga, which is about a thousand times better. ~!So Yuuko has forgotten Niiya due to his inconsideration and her own hate towards the other Yuuko. And instead of trying to help her, reforging the relationship they had, Niiya just... gives up. I'm serious. He says he's sad, he misses Yuuko, he _cries_, then a wild Okonogi appears and Yuuko is forgotten to go eat with her for what likes months on end. It gets so bad he can't even see Yuuko anymore. But then he falls on her boobs and she remembers.!~ \n\nEpisode 10 is where the score went from a likely 5 to a 3. Yuuko's past is finally revealed after Niiya convinces her that the other Yuuko is just another part of her and they accept her death together as the events from 60 years ago unravel. (This is the manga's version.)\n\nWait, no? That's not what happens? If you want to know: ~!What happens is that Niiya runs away from the other Yuuko while telling Yuuko that she needs to figure out her past and the other Yuuko shows it to an _unwilling_ Niiya instead to the willing Yuuko and Niiya. Then there's bullshit about Niiya having literally _absorbed_ Yuuko's past and now she can't see him. But then he kicks a doll and she can and she finally accepts the other Yuuko. (This is the anime's version.)!~\n\nWhy did they change that? At that point everyone watching had already figured out what the other Yuuko was and I was screaming at Niiya that what he'd wanted from the start was literally offering itself to him on a silver platter.\n\nBut this is far, far from the worst things the staff changed, and I was _mad_ when I realized what they were doing. If you thought Yuuko's death was tragic in the anime, you know nothing.\n\nIn the anime, they changed one of the cruelest twist in manga history and destroyed Yuuko's character for... nothing! There's nothing in the manga that would need censure! Why did they do it?. ~!So she goes to save a random ass kid and is sacrificed. She breaks her leg falling and just sits there dying until at the last moment she lets go of hatred as she dies.!~\n\nI guess they wanted to keep her pure and nice? But wouldn't that have made her pass away in peace and you know, not become a ghost? Because she was still alive. Am I supposed to believe that your emotions have a will of their own?\n\nHere is the manga version, highly recommend you go read it, even if it's just the ending.\n\n~!In the manga, Yuuko goes after her vanished _sister_ instead of some random kid. When she gets to the school, screaming at the elders to let her sister go, she sees that Yukariko is Akahito. \n\nThen her sister turns to her and says: \"Kanoe Yuuko is the sacrifice!\"\n\nThe elders break Yuuko's goddamn leg- no, it wasn't broken in the fall- and toss her into the darkness of the buried shrine room and Yukariko orders they close off the opening and stands there _as her sister screams her name, begging for her life as she's being buried alive._ \n\nYou think that's all? Months later, Yukariko returns after her dad killed himself over Yuuko's death and finds the comb Yuuko used to brush her hair one last time. Overcome by guilt and regret, she tears away the planks and finds Yuuko's rotting body. She weeps her sister's death until Yuuko's ghost shows up, warped by hate. She strangles Yukariko, who decides she deserves it and wants to be with her sister more than anything. But her loving words bring Yuuko back and she leaves. It's implied she severed her hateful self soon after that. Yukariko kept living in guilt, thinking it Yuuko's revenge. !~\n\nI went back to look at the dates and ok the manga finished a year after the anime but couldn't they have asked the author what they were going to do? Because this is so, so inferior to the manga and it pisses me off because you need to have read the manga to see. Everyone else just thinks this is sad as it is when in fact it's so much worse.\n\nAnd I am far from someone who rages every time an adaptation changes the littlest thing. But the changes need to mean something? Like when they use the movement of the elevator in episode 1. But this was 100% plot and there was nothing to change. \n\nSo... if you're interested in this, highly recommend the manga if only for the ending and look at the first episode if you really want, it's the best one.\n\nAbout the animation, it was alright. I didn't like how they let go of the roundness of author's style. But the use of black bars, the old Japanese artstyle and the colors switches, while a little out of place, brought back memories of Bakemonogatari. The sunsets were amazing and when there's horror it's pretty well done- in the first part at least.\n\nI didn't like Yuuko's voice actress tho. I felt like she was way miscasted and that the character would've gained more from a less high-pitched and cute voice. She's still a ghost, after all, and this is supposed to be horror. The romance was... okay, I guess, if you count fanservice as romance, but can you really cheer for these guys? Yuuko's already dead! Niiya's gonna grow old and she's going to stay at 15 years old in mind and body. And he's going to stop going to school one day. \n\nThe characters weren't particularly unique. Yuuko was 75% fanservice, Kirie is a tsundere, Okonogi's an idiot and Niiya's the male protagonist. The only interesting thing that was happening was the Kirie/Okonogi ship but that was dropped immediately after it started.\n\nI can't really think of anyone to recommend this too when the manga's so much better in everything.

Among such lists, you might sometimes see Gundam ZZ being thrown around, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very understandable as to both why one would give it such a label and as to why one would defend it as something that becomes good over time. Regardless, most fans who see it tend to agree that the first 20 or so episodes of ZZ are terrible, hindering what they consider to be an otherwise fine enough installment.\n\nGundam ZZ is a case of \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo little too late\u00e2\u0080\u009d. While the latter half on its own is a decently serviceable installment in terms of quality, with a few surprisingly good moments, the former half is probably the worst I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen of the franchise to date. It is genuinely terrible, insufferable even. It would take a lot for me to find the series remotely tolerable after 22 episodes of intense suffering on my end thanks to absolutely abysmal characterization, franchise betrayals, and many more grievances that utterly destroy this first half, and while the second half is fine enough, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfine enough\u00e2\u0080\u009d doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cut it when trying to salvage an otherwise 1/10 series, especially when after episode 36, the second half stops being \u00e2\u0080\u009cfine enough\u00e2\u0080\u009d and goes back to being horrible, as if turning over a new leaf was a ruse. This is Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ, the black sheep of Early Universal Century and the bastard successor to Zeta Gundam. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dive in, shall we?\n\nPart 1: Brutal downgrades of old characters and what ZZ does to Zeta\n\nIt's easy for some to look at the show and say \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe second half makes the show decent though the first half is bad\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and that only really works if the first half isn't insanely horrific and if the second half is really, really good. Neither is the case, and the first half of this show is either a doubt the absolute worst this franchise has to offer, even now when comparing it to Twilight Axis and SEED Destiny. The thing is, at least those don't go out of their way to piss all over their predecessors.\n\nSay what you will about Zeta Gundam, you cannot deny the growth some of the characters had over time. That makes it all the more infuriating when important characters such as Fa Yuiry and Yazan Gable get nerfed ridiculously, losing to and all around being completely outclassed complete newbies like Judau Ashta early into the show. Fa became a competent pilot at the end of Zeta Gundam and Yazan was one of the scariest, more formidable forces of that show too. To see them become bad pilots is aggravating and beyond nonsensical.\n\nHell, the very second episode starts off with a middle finger as well. Note that I said second episode since episode one is a weird recap of 0079 and Zeta with Char Aznable doing some Mobile Suit quiz for some reason. It has apparently been two weeks since the end of Zeta and the beginning of ZZ if what I was told was correct. Knowing that: how is Yazan still alive? To be honest, they didn't exactly make any fanfare of his supposed death in Zeta but there was no way he could've survived the attack he was faced with that destroyed his Hambrabi. Here he is, passed out in his escape pod, seemingly not having eaten any food or drank any water, which is impossible for a human to survive. Also, within this time, the Argama seriously couldn't find a single hospital or colony at all for Kamille to rest in? Oh, and instead of being reduced to a childlike state without memories of the series like at the finale of Zeta, he now can't talk and is barely even conscious enough to transfer his newtype powers to Judau. Way to be inconsistent right out the bat!\n\nHaman Karn was the most charismatic, commanding, intriguing, and intimidating character introduced in Zeta Gundam towards the later part of its run. She was as evil as she was cool and sexy. Here she does retain a lot of that, but she is far more vulnerable, particularly around Judau. Episode 27, in particular, made it much harder to take the character seriously as a badass threat. They do try again towards the final 7 episodes, and it does work, but even still, she won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be as much of a powerhouse on screen after episode 27. She doesn't have it the worst in terms of downgrades, however, and we already discussed Fa. The only major character left to discuss in terms of that is Captain Bright, but I'll save him for when I discuss the new characters, especially since the one responsible for his downgrade is only notable for that.\n\nThe downgrades aren't just in terms of the returning characters either: the visuals animation and especially the music took a hit as well. ZZ has far less of the impeccable shading often present in Zeta Gundam, though for a long (for the time) anime beginning weeks after another long one by the same studio, it still holds up well minus a few egregious errors like one particular clip with the Hyaku Shiki in episode 23. There is unfortunately some more reused footage than Zeta, which has very little, but most of it is for the transformation of the ZZ and whenever a Qubeley (or anything directly part of the Qubeley line) launches its funnels. The character designs are also slightly inferior, especially thanks to a certain character I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll cover. Even still, it's clear that the production values here are a bit lower than previously, as understandable as it is, especially when the new mobile suits introduced on the whole still look very good, especially the one introduced in episode 37.\n\nThe music however cannot be forgiven. In terms of the old tracks, they are rarely used effectively since 80% of the time, they do not remotely fit the scenes in ZZ, unlike in Zeta where they complimented nearly every action scene. The new OST is pretty mediocre on its own with fewer scenarios that could hope to compliment them in this show. Even worse is later down the line when those new tracks stop fitting most of the scenes present in the show altogether whereas some of the worked constantly in the first half of the show, as bad and repetitive as those tracks are. The OST is just as repetitive as before but now nothing works so it just becomes much harder to tolerate the repetition. If there is one improvement, however, it would be the OPs (\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnime Ja Nai: Yume wo Wasureta Furui Chikyuujin yo (\u00e3\u0082\u00a2\u00e3\u0083\u008b\u00e3\u0083\u00a1\u00e3\u0081\u0098\u00e3\u0082\u0083\u00e3\u0081\u00aa\u00e3\u0081\u0084-\u00e5\u00a4\u00a2\u00e3\u0082\u0092\u00e5\u00bf\u0098\u00e3\u0082\u008c\u00e3\u0081\u009f\u00e5\u008f\u00a4\u00e3\u0081\u0084\u00e5\u009c\u00b0\u00e7\u0090\u0083\u00e4\u00ba\u00ba\u00e3\u0082\u0088-)\" by Masato Arai\u00e2\u0080\u009d and #2: \"Silent Voice (\u00e3\u0082\u00b5\u00e3\u0082\u00a4\u00e3\u0083\u00ac\u00e3\u0083\u00b3\u00e3\u0083\u0088\u00e3\u0083\u00bb\u00e3\u0083\u00b4\u00e3\u0082\u00a9\u00e3\u0082\u00a4\u00e3\u0082\u00b9)\" by Jun Hiroe) and EDs (\"Jidai ga Naiteiru (\u00e6\u0099\u0082\u00e4\u00bb\u00a3\u00e3\u0081\u008c\u00e6\u00b3\u00a3\u00e3\u0081\u0084\u00e3\u0081\u00a6\u00e3\u0081\u0084\u00e3\u0082\u008b)\" by Masato Arai and \"Issenmannen Ginga (\u00e4\u00b8\u0080\u00e5\u008d\u0083\u00e4\u00b8\u0087\u00e5\u00b9\u00b4\u00e9\u008a\u0080\u00e6\u00b2\u00b3)\" by Jun Hiroe) with the OPs being decent if going on for too many episodes, and the EDs being just meh. That isn't remotely enough to make up for the brutally lackluster, ill-fitting, and repetitive OST.\n\nPart 2: Irritability of the humor, stupidity, and cast of the first 24 episodes\n\nExcluding the admittedly odd recap first episode, the series starts off...not half bad, actually. Episode 2 is a decent enough episode minus the bullshit I mentioned earlier. The humor that would characterize the rest of this anime was controlled and not horribly in our face just yet, especially when there was major consequence involved. Killing off even one of the minor Zeta characters (Saegusa) so early was risky though. We meet the new guys, and there is one hilarious reaction joke regarding Captain Bright connecting the dots about Judau. Episode 3 doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t start off half bad either, especially since the humor was still pretty funny. Then, something happened. Mashymre appeared. Then we get the bad attempts of humor that dwarf the series, repetitive as hell humor on top for that, and the fact that it becomes basically a Saturday morning cartoon. This is Universal Century Gundam. I get that Tomino wanted to make sure this installment at least started lighter than the constantly heavy and unhappy Zeta, but its like they went to the other extreme. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mainly due to the horrible new cast, which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to.\n\nThe sappy drama that occurs occasionally regarding Fa, or the MoonMoon people is just pathetic as well. To be fair, episodes 18 and 19, where Ple (or Puru) is introduced, are decent episodes with better action and less stupidity but episodes 20-22 ruined that. There are so many individual moments in the first 24 episodes that are so wrong that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d need to compile a list of them, not including the bits I mentioned earlier, assuming I was able to track down everything I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said over those episodes, such as retarded character decisions in episode 11 and 12, not using mobile suits that are perfectly functional and available for them (MK.II in episode 13), not shooting or attacking enemies that are in front of them because the writers want to keep their protagonists alive (episodes 16, 27, and 38 but there it was shooting an ally that was shooting an enemy), Shinta and Qum announcing their plan in front of a bitch they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to know heard their plans (episode 18), and so, so much more. Plus, the entirety of the MoonMoon arc and Cecilia arc (the first time the show tries to go back to the darker, more melodramatic tone of Zeta) is stupid. Oh yeah, this show has story arcs, and they're rather hit or miss. \n\nThe new cast is absolutely abysmal, and this will take quite a while to get through. The od cast got fucked and these new guys are among the worst new casts in the franchise. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start to the top for this first half only, with Judau Ashta. He starts out completely insufferable. Imagine Kamille Bidan but unjustifiable and more than willing to attack even those who aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t being assholes or otherwise very harsh to him (even resorting to attacking Fa when she slaps him for being a cunt to his sister in episode 6). He and his friends are total shitbags to each other, though around the time he stupidly gets Leena kidnapped by Glemy and soon after, meeting Ple, he actually becomes remotely tolerable and responsible. Still, the damage is insane, too much to be easily rectified. Beecha and Mondo start off as just the worst. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re cowardly, traitorous sellouts willing to actually kill Judau over some cash, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just supposed to be seen as troublemaker friends and not complete and utter scum. Needless to say, I hated them the most out of the entire group. Lino is basically this powerless, wimpy character and faint voice of reason, so he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basically just kinda there. Roux is the most tolerable (and attractive) of the bunch but is basically the lancer of the group...full of lancers...huh. Elle is kinda a bad character who really is just the amalgamation of many of literally every other member of the group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s traits so of course she sucks. Lastly, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Leina, Judau\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little sister who is basically a damsel in distress and a nag. Of course she sucks...\n\nThe antagonists don't fare much better, especially in the first half. We start off with Mashymre, who is a complete pathetic tool and cartoon of a character. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a stretch to say that in the first half especially, he is a one-dimensional Saturday morning villain who is all about chivalry for his lady, in the most repetitive gags in the franchise. It was funny seeing Judau call him pretentious though and I did grow to empathize him for one reason I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to. Glemy doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t start off that much better, just being kind of a typical nobleman character meant to teach Leina \u00e2\u0080\u009csome manners\u00e2\u0080\u009d and become a pathetic loser around Roux. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this fucking fatass named Guzin who is both a Saturday morning villain and an obnoxious scumbag, and that combo works horribly and I wish he was dead. We never see the fucker after the crew leaves Shangri-la anyway, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pathetic that Yazan had to work with him; how far the man has fallen\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\nHere we go. Rev up that harsh DOOM 2016 music and put it on full blast because here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where I get truly violent! Remember when I said I empathize with Mashymre? Well, he said a line about wishing death upon this character. CHARA SUNE!! FUCK CHARA SUNE!!!! This bitch, this whore, this harlot...his Jem and the Holograms reject BIMBO\u00e2\u0080\u00a6deserves all of my hate! Never have I met a character so insufferable and brutally inconsistent in my life, and she is definitely a contender for the worst character in Gundam history! She has no concrete personality beyond being an insufferable cunt whose sex appeal is flaunted to obnoxious degrees. I get why that is but not only does it never make any sense (apparently some cyber newtype bs and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to why all of that falls apart soon enough) but she flip-flops constantly with no real catalyst for it beyond Judau towards the end. The worst has to be her insufferable and wince-worthy behavior when piloting a mobile suit and I am glad she disappeared for a good 20 episodes after episode 21 because I could not stand her for any second she was on screen. Fuck you, Chara Sune, for single-handedly making most of the 2nd quarter of the show impossible to bear! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad she's dead! Plus, her voice was horrific and the acting was equally terrible; who hired her seiyuu and who was their seiyuu?\n\nThe only other character left is Emary and her only character trait for a large majority of this series is being super lovestruck over Captain Bright, who has a wife and kid, and he gets really awkward around her. This is all she serves in the narrative for most of the run of the show and it looks bad on such a good and prominent character like Bright. What happened to Bright, man? Not only this but he is decidedly less harsh and strict with the new guys than he was with Amuro or Kamille, despite them being way worse than those two, and it hasn't been long since he had been with Kamille. Another way of being less dark and heavy? Fuck off, ZZ, you take that back after 19 episodes anyway.\n\nPart 3: Quarter 3 and what it improved/did right\n\nThere is much debate as to where the show started getting consistently better. May say episode 19, some go 23, but to be perfectly honest, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say 28 was when the show started getting consistently good episodes. This means that while the third quarter is decent, it takes a good way into that quarter for consistently improved quality. For the sake of semantics, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll start at the episode where the Argama crew first land on Earth: episode 23, which is roughly the halfway mark.\n\n23-27 is sort of a mixed bag. 23 and 24 are decent episodes and show that these cretins can be a functional and tolerable unit, especially episode 23. 25-27 is why I don't cite 23 as the changing period and instead cite 28. 25 is a decent skirmish with a few slip-ups but 26 makes 25 look stupid since while in 25, the crew engage in their first desert battle against veteran soldiers of the one-year war and win without too much trouble, one girl in a Gelgoog in 26 gets the crew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s balls rocked. 27 is where I couldn't take Haman nearly as seriously anymore when Judau pulls some crazy newtype bs out of his ass and Haman pusses out of shooting him (she had a lot of opportunities too since she came with intent on shooting him). 28 was the first good episode since 23 since Leina \u00e2\u0080\u009cdies\u00e2\u0080\u009d (I'll touch on that bullshit later); not only do I not like her but it was a real interesting and dramatic moment for the cast at large, even if they do not progress much as characters beyond a few patched up melodrama bits and Judau becoming more responsible.\n\nThe Blue Corps and Dublin arcs are actually good. Around this time, even a few episodes earlier, ZZ became a conventionally enjoyable series, though not exceptional. The stories make actual sense for most part until episode 36, characters such as Kamille and Hayato return and are still engaging, and we actually see characters grow and see the main team actually have some semblance of teamwork, which some people pride this group on (despite them almost never having any remote semblance of teamwork or camaraderie at all throughout the show). They also develop Glemy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s darker more manipulative and ambitious side and even capitalized on his lovestruck loser side for better comedy, as well as using it against him. The action scenes were cooler too. What these arcs, in particular, did especially good is getting us to have a reason to care. We care about the Blue Corps and how Glemy gets sucked into the incident, as well as Kamille, Hayato, their situations, and the colony drop, off of which were some of the highlights of the Dubin arc, which, barring the final part of that 3 episode arc, was the best part of the show. If the show were more like this, it would be a decent, maybe even good show, since 9 of these 15 episodes were actually good. All of the antagonists I hated were gone for these sets of episodes and Glemy became a formidable and interesting villain, exploring more of the whole Ple stuff introduced short after Ple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s introduction in episode 18, even if little makes sense (I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll address all of the newtype and cyber newtype stuff that would become the biggest problem of the second half when I get to part 5, as that is where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at its worst). Killing Hayato after he ends up knowing what happened to Katz was an unfortunate move though.\n\nPle is one of the only decent characters of the show and while we see her in the first half and get to know that despite being this unfortunate cyber newtype, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a kid at heart, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s here where she becomes more prominent, though more annoying in the leary part of this quarter. Even many of the protagonists get sick of her shit, though it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not so easy to stay mad at her when she still has competence and is a kid, especially after Lina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeath\u00e2\u0080\u009d, where she has his arc about trying to fill the void Leina left after trying to usurp Leina for so long. Shame it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get a proper conclusion and everything this show had going for it that was established with these episodes gets fucked, especially since Ple dies in a bullshit way after Ple-Two becomes a thing and Mashymre comes back (admittedly cooler than before but still a bad, one-dimensional character) in episodes 36 and 37. \n\nPart 4: Before I knew it, the first half of quarter 4 betrayed me\n\nLeina lives...and the emotional impact of episode 28 dies. Just...why? How? Oh, and now she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a newtype even more powerful than Kamille since she can communicate from...somewhere on Earth whilst the crew she is communicating with is in space. Oh, and for some unknown reason, they made Beecha captain instead of Judau, the one man with more leadership qualities than the rest of the group. It's interesting that Beecha thinks that something is wrong with Judau in either a mental or emotional way and they probably would've been interesting if that were the case now that there is no one left to fill Judau\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cLeina\u00e2\u0080\u009d void even remotely, now that Puru is dead.\n\nFor some reason, Mashymre has a new crew with Illya and other people and they battle Judau and co.of course but the dumbest thing in episode 38 happens just like in 37 with the Leina stuff. This one Zeon guy has disobeyed an order but is still completing the objective and is not even a second away from shooting the bridge of the Nahel Argama, and his superior, Illya, kills him. It's obviously a retarded way by the writer(s) to keep the protagonists alive but believe me; it gets worse. Episodes 36-38 have has some dumb shit happen, some of which were especially bad but they weren't enough to make me rescind every positive thing I've ever said about the third quarter of ZZ, until I get to the Rasara arc. The Rasara arc (episodes 39-41) is hands down the worst piece of Gundam fiction I have ever encountered! Each episode in this arc is worse than the last and it feels like some of the worst of what the already abominable first half of this show provided, and barring what it does to Mondo, this arc is completely pointless. It's meaningless and all it adds to Mondo is sadness that only really has any relevance to anyone in episode 45, but I'll get to the laughable final 5 episodes later. For now, how about we rip this arc apart for betraying me so! \n\nSomehow, Haman disguises herself and is now in a refugee ship that her forces attack in an attempt to lure the Nahel Argama. How did they know they were coming? Don't say \u00e2\u0080\u009cHaman can sense Judau\u00e2\u0080\u009d since that's an automatic two-way street for the both of them and Judau can't sense Haman, even when he is touching her and she gives off her newtype vibes and speaks to him! This is episode 39 and it's pretty bad, but it's definitely the best episode in this arc. Oh, did I forget to mention that the MoonMoon tribe from the god-awful MoonMoon arc just randomly pop into the arc and stay with the crew for the remainder of it? Why?! No one liked the MoonMoon arc! Even worse, Sarasa of that arc notices Haman and bites her as having an evil suspicious aura, re no one questions/interrogates her! How stupid are these people?! Then episode 40 rolls around and we get introduced to the absolute worst character in the second half of ZZ: Stampa Halloi! He is just the worst: some fugly fatass generic dog of a man, and barring being a complete fucking coward, this is his only character trait! He is worse than Gemon! He is Chara Sune levels of bad! Thank fuck he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only here for two episodes, and hopefully, he died when Mondo stabbed his mobile suit! We also get introduced to some troublemaking punks that end up being a parallel to the protagonists in their own introduction, but nothing is done with it; they don't even stay once the arc is over, and once everyone meets Stamps and fight his goons, and Judau finally recognizes Haman from her voice, how do they escape? I'm serious. How? Because fuck it, that's why!\n\nThen episode 41 begins, and it is...unspeakable. Anyone who has made it this far knows that Mondo loves Rasara, so what is the right thing to do? Kill her off of course! I mean, there are interesting ways to do that to make him grow, but here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where things get fucky: she was getting a bit weak at the beginning, and when Stampa is chasing Mondo in a mobile suit, he dived down, and she dived down on top of him to protect him from harm; she somehow died almost immediately afterwards. Sure, rubble falls down around then, but none of that hits either of them! And then her body looks like it has taken a beating on the front, for no reason! As bizarre and stupid as Puru\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death was, at least it had a catalyst! This? No! Not one thing that could lead to her death here. It's not like she was fatally ill or anything, so how the fuck did she die?! Then an action scene begins and for anyone who could ever enter, their beam weapons were covered up entirely and not allowed to be pulled out, and it keeps that tradition during the fight scene...until Illya and Beecha use their beam sabers, contradicting all of that. Thankfully Mondo finally stabbed Stampa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mobile suit, possibly killing him...only for it to not explode. Fuck it, I'm done, this arc is over! It was an exercise in punishment, suffering, and the utmost betrayal, and every second of it was as bad, if not worse than every single insipid episode that came before! This arc and this show can rot in hell, and anything and everything good about the previous episodes has been utterly obliterated!\n\nPart 5: Glemy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revolt, the mishandling of the newtype concept, and the glorious retardation of the final 6 episodes\n\nThe final 6 episodes of ZZ are an exhibition of glory, both in terms of how epic they were and how monumentally imbecilic they were. These episodes are gloriously bad due to the brutally terrible foundation for these episodes and the fact that there are integral parts, scenes, and explanations missing here, mainly for two specific things that utterly decapitate these episodes: Newtypes and Glemy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revolt. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s do Glemy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revolt first since there are fewer things to talk about as to why this fails massively.\n\nWe do in fact see that Glemy had ambitions of usurping Haman to rule Neo Zeon. Problem is: we don't see how his rebellion starts. We don't see how he is able to convince a myriad of soldiers under his belt or otherwise, to go along with him instead of Haman. Given that this is the impetus for the conflict of the final 5 episodes, in particular, ignoring something so important to this part of the plot is quite a bad move. Hell, they could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve skipped the Rasara arc entirely to focus on expanding on this much-needed origin of rebellion, especially since there are only minor inklings of potential for this revolt prior to Glemy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next appearance which is to effectively begin it. This intertwines with the next thing that kills the rest of this show. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s finally time for the climax of this review; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s high time I talk about: the Newtype shenanigans.\n\nWhere do I begin? There is so, so much to cover here. How about starting with Chara, just to get the dead bitch out of the way. Oh yeah, she dies retardedly in the final episode while shouting her name triumphantly. Apparently, there is something wrong about her and how she is a cyber newtype to the point where this is used to explain all of her inconsistent behaviors throughout her appearance in episodes 10-21 and the final 6 episodes. Obviously, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fly since she has no concrete personality this cyber newtype stuff is supposed to deal with barring her being a demanding bitch...which she is no matter what unless she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smothering Judau in her bosom. A similar treatment is given to Mashymre after his departure around episode 12 and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know why. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see how he keeps getting roided, and we only ever see one newtype facility and that was for the purus that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll cover after this. Zeta bothered to show some of that shit, why not ZZ? He even has this happened between episodes of this section of the show offscreen. This is important and compromising information that we are missing out of. He overloads and commits the coolest act in this entire show and the most epic suicide in all of anime, if not all of fiction. The only thing I know to remotely rival this is the famous scene from Independence Day with the guy that crashed into the mothership. It's ineffective, sure, but he does it with such gusto the tits cool regardless, and literally, everyone takes notice.\n\nSpeaking of Ples, before I dive into this particular shitsow, how about I say that Ple-Two is a decent enough character who goes through the typical \u00e2\u0080\u009cchoose between brainwashing and freedom side while your head hurts\u00e2\u0080\u009d plot. Also, she is literally fucking impossible, her and the Ple army. Did they simply create Ple clones or something? We don't know. How come Haman knew nothing about any of this? No spies or mandatory reports? Somehow Ple (and eventually Judau) can channel newtype energy so powerful as to deflect beams entirely, and that literally makes no conceivable sense ever, and fuck episode 36 for including such faggoty retardation. Ple-Two controlling her mechs with her mind makes sense; RC control of them with her mind (aka doing it outside of the mech, like remote control with her mind) is a stretch, especially for giant mechs and those other shooting funnels being controlled all at once. \n\nIn general, they keep adding new, absolutely stupid bs to the newtype business and even among that, it's wildly inconsistent at times. Also, somehow Judau does the same bullshit Kamille did at the end of his series which was always baffling and stupid because the final few episodes of Zeta were also retarded but this is next level shit. The last two episodes are especially riddled with stupidity however and make for a laughable bad finale. They also add forced romantic stuff between Beecha and Elle (who had no inkling of it and when Beecha said he was trying to be nice to her, everyone in the audience should call bullshit when they were all jackasses, especially him, Luke when he and Mondo tried to actively get Judau killed in the first half) for no real reason other than trying to make us feel happy and go \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat a long way these guys have come\u00e2\u0080\u009d (though the second time they try that tactic, this time with the final episode with Judau and then saying one more goodbye before he faces off Haman was good). We don't how how Leina survived that incident in episode 28 of a mobile suit crashing and exploding into her shack where she was resting, setting the whole thing on fire (Sunrise\u00e2\u0080\u00a6) but apparently now she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s with Seila Mass...who just happens to be on Earth somewhere and we don't even know where. Also, Ple-Two dies in the final episode (or at least passes or and is never seen again but come on, that's most likely death) and no one gives a fuck. Haman dies in a retarded way as well, and Glemy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death scene makes no sense either both in terms of the Gundam that killed him and the fact that after Ple-Two rejected him to go with Judau, she jumps to save him as he disintegrates and his Mobile Armor blows up and she dies soon after (why?). Oh, and nothing is resolved about this war other than the two tyrants dying but that's apparently good enough for this anime...bleh!\n\nEpilogue\n\nSo that was Mobile Suit ZZ. A broken, stupid, largely insufferable mess of a series that took far too long to only temporarily become remotely decent, all the while downgrading everything positive about Zeta such as the visuals to some extent and especially the music. What a chaotic shitshow. The only reasons this isn't the worst in the franchise are that Twilight Axis exists now, almost \u00e2\u0085\u0095 of this series was good and some parts weren't all that terrible, but when over half of your series, especially in the first half, is a 0/10, then there really is little hope for salvation, since it not only compounds every issue Zeta (an infinitely better anime) had but had its own heap of issues to fill a space colony.\n\nTo be honest, I see little reason to watch this unless you really want to complete every Gundam anime out there, as it's among the worst-written of them all. This is also the longest anime I've completed that I personally detest. As bad as SEED Destiny and 00 Second Season are, I don't outright hate them like I do with this one. It is one of two in this franchise I actively despise thus far; ZZ is truly the most loathsome this franchise has ever been. Now, with all that said, I bid you adieu."}, {"id": 3108, "score": 49, "body": "*******************************************************************************************************************\n~~~img220(https://i.imgur.com/3IjKs1a.jpg)~~~\n*******************************************************************************************************************\nSendo sincero, isso foi uma das maiores decep\u00c3\u00a7\u00c3\u00b5es de 2018... ele possu\u00c3\u00ada um \u00c3\u00b3timo Hype, mas N chegou nem perto do que se esperava...\n~~~img220(https://i.imgur.com/kvdqcQ0.png)~~~\nUm Anime pode ter seus defeitos, isso \u00c3\u00a9 bastante normal.. mas quando eles s\u00c3\u00a3o extremos, \u00c3\u00a9 s\u00c3\u00b3 a for\u00c3\u00a7a de vontade q pode ser capaz de fazer com q o espectador finalize obra...\"3D Kanojo: Real Girl\" foi um grande desafio para mim, minha politica anti dropp foi posta em prova....\n># \"Or\u00c3\u00a1s... como voc\u00c3\u00aa pode dizer isso?!\"\n\nAbiguinho.... primeiramente os personagens est\u00c3\u00a3o mortos (expressividade):\n~~~img220(https://i.imgur.com/is1MSAF.jpg) img220(https://i.imgur.com/69GNLSK.jpg)~~~\nArisa Ishino (da esquerda) est\u00c3\u00a1 em uma pose de \"expressividade amorosa\" (apreciando um desenrolar amoroso), convenhamos, esse rosto est\u00c3\u00a1 muito expressivo, vemos a qualidade de express\u00c3\u00a3o dela (rs)...

A popular piece of media comes out and proves to be a hit, both critically, and financially. Some odd years later, a sequel is made that exists solely because the first one was popular, rather than because there was something to add. It gets panned, financial success or no. \n\nFLCL Progressive is yet another example of this tale. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what would happen if they tried to make FLCL in the current day -as of writing- without any of the charm or passion that went into the original. Love it or hate it, FLCL is a distinct piece of work, one filled with little references and neat, temporary art-style shake-ups to add flavor to an already eccentric and visually stunning take on the coming of age story. Progressive is milquetoast at the best of times and downright broken at the worst of times. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no flavor outside of moments that already take cues from its predecessor, and perhaps a few bits in the latter half. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have anything worth covering, let alone bringing to the table.\n\nIt would be one thing if, in spite of this, this sequel worked as a functioning tale with the audiovisual mastery that exemplifies the best of the current age. It would simply be an unnecessary addition, but a harmless one at best. However, we instead get a mess that decides to pander. Think about it. Why else does the main character wear headphones that have cat ears? Why else do we have a loli and a beach episode? Why else do they just randomly include smartphones without having anything be done with them? Why else does this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s equivalent to Haruko wear a sexy maid outfit? Simply because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hip with the current otaku crowd.\n\nThe real origins of Haruko and her Progressive counterpart, Jinyu, are not only stupid, but also somewhat contradictory to FLCL 1 and raise some questions the original was never equipped to answer. The things they try to add about the universe of the franchise are absurd and even inconsistent, even by the conventions of the franchise as well. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already aggravating that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all in service to a show that has nothing new or interesting to comment on in any meaningful way. The characters make it even worse. Hidomi is a nothing character. There is nothing consistent to her other than having a secret want to reset the world for particularly incongruous and asinine reasons. The show even claims she is going for a tsundere angle, as god awful as that observation is, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as inaccurate as a blind man shooting in the dark. Even Haruko largely just an adult brat rather than the quirky, ambitious, and amoral vixen from the original. Her counterpart, Jinyu, is bland like Hidomi, but at least she is the least obnoxious character of the entire cast. The male students in the show are also nothing characters with no chemistry, even though the main guy of that trio, Lide, acts infinitely more like an active protagonist than Hidomi ever does. The loli character also isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any better; she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as unremarkable as the rest. No one has any chemistry to speak of, adding insult to injury.\n\nOutside of the ending credits and the 5th episode, the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visuals are rather dull to look at. Production I.G honestly did a poor job outside of the hit and miss new character designs, as the more kinetic moments of action often feel either stilted or choppy. The show is never quite as fluid or graceful as its 18-year-old predecessor was. Even in the art style shift in the 5th episode that actually made Haruko look more similar to how she was in FLCL than in the episodes preceding it, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arguable if the more purposely rough visuals worked. The music is as much to my distaste and uninterest as ever, with several songs by The Pillows, both new and old, and largely forgettable background music outside of that, which is barely any more memorable than the original.\n\nIn essence, FLCL 2 is your typical underwhelming sequel. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen worse in this regard, even in terms of sequels to Gainax shows, but damning with faint praise doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t excuse how pointless, shallow, and lifeless this installment really is. Sadly, its existence also slightly nullifies some of the uniqueness of the original, so doing nothing substantial to help make up for that is arguably one of the biggest crimes this sequel could have committed under these circumstances. At least it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use that show as a crutch, but again, it does that anime and several of its fans no favors, either.

However, his plans are broken due to a \"pact\" forced unto him by the \"Wicked Eye\", otherwise known as Rikka Takanashi (another chunnibyou victim). The series explores the bizarre relationship between the eccentric girl and the boy running away from his past.\n\n~~~__Heavy Spoilers Ahead__~~~\n\nimg(https://i1.wp.com/thebiem.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/1362914511151.jpg?fit=780%2C488&ssl=1)\n\n# Story and Characters\n\nEvery single character in the series is flat, uninteresting, and exists mostly for comedy purposes. This is most notable in the supporting cast. Rikka is the only character that isn't entirely superficial and generic, which is sad considering how terrible her backstory was handled.\n\nAlongside our main couple there are other members of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cFar Eastern Magic Nap Society.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Isshikik is Yuuta's best friend and likes girls. Nibutani is kind of a tsundure but not really, since there is no actual relationship tension between her and Yuuta. Kumin is naive and likes to take naps. Lastly, Sanae Dekomori, she is rich and is Yuuta's servant. There are only small amounts of dialogue which gives us any kind of backstory or insight into these characters.\n\nLet's talk about our main protagonist, Yuuta. His only characteristic that differentiates him from any other generic rom-com is his earlier experience with chuunibyou. He used to act like he was some kind of warrior. Then there is nothing unique about him. He likes to help others, he is kind of awkward, he does decent at school, etc. \n\nOther characters appear throughout the series, including Yuuta's family and Rikka's as well. There is not much to mention about Yuuta's family. Rikka's family is a complicated situation, her sister receives plenty of screen-time but we know little about her. She is a hardworking chef that somewhat cares for her sister (but takes the first opportunity to leave her and work elsewhere). Also she is kind of a yandere. She was the most interesting one out of all the characters in my opinion, simply because it was unclear what her motivations were. I didn't knew if she really cared for Rikka or it was mostly out of a sense of duty. However, this might be an issue on my side and not on the show. Then we have Rikka's grandparents, they are just there to create drama. Rikka's parents are another problem. Her mother is a mystery to the audience, she abandoned her child but later comes back for an \"emotional moment\". It feels out of place and poorly explained, there is no reason for this to happen, and if there is, why should the audience care? \n\nLastly, we have Rikka's father, his death is the cause for the chuunibyou. The audience is supposed to sympathize with Rikka and why she is so weird, the way Yuuta does. However, this is executed horribly. First, the lack of self awareness in Rikka makes her a delusional character, not really a troubled one. Furthermore, the reveal is done at such a slow pace (it takes various episodes for any development to occur after Rikka becomes \"depressed\" is what I mean), that either you see it coming a mile away, or you are confused as to what is happening in the last 4 episodes of the show. Lastly, the flashbacks are done so poorly I never felt like the relationship between Rikka and her father was strong enough to cause her to change so much (we do not even see the face of his father). Maybe an episode long flashback like it was done in Darling in the Franxx (a show with many problems, but the flashback episode was well done at least) would have helped. You may argue that the reason for her chuunibyou is meeting \"Dark Flame Master\" and falling in love with him and not completely because of her father's death. But she only sees him for like five minutes.\n\nAlso might I mention the scene where Kumin (best girl) becomes the \"Wicked Eye\" was just absurd.\n\nFurthermore, the biggest problem with the series is its lack of a consistent message. Yuuta argues that Rikka's chuunibyou is very important for her personality and her mental health, as it relieves the pain of her father's death. Nibutani also explains how everyone has a little chuunibyou inside and it is unavoidable. However, nothing that happens in the show supports this idea (it doesn't matter if you agree with it or not). Rikka becomes friends with other classmates when she abandons her chuunibyou. Yuuta shows no signs of being worse off than when he was in middle school; he is responsible, friendly, and has no major flaws. Also, Nibutani drops out of the acting club because of the supposed \"chuunibyou\" in the rest of the members (she is also better off not acting like a weirdo, mainly because she is popular). Sanae is also fine after leaving behind her fantasies.\n\nAnother flaw that must not be overlooked, is the lack of character development in Sanae Dekomori. There are \"emotional\" scenes were she appears to be sad at Rikka not participating in their fantasies. However, she has no reason to be that way, unlike Rikka. This lack of motivation make these \"emotional\" scenes feel forced and fake.\n\nI still appreciate that the relationship between Rikka and Yuuta went somewhere and we were given closure, unlike most rom-coms.\n\nimg(https://d1m6vmmwsgiy3l.cloudfront.net/images/screenshots/screenshot_1_32503.jpg)\n\n# Animation and Sound\n\nThis series definitely has impressive visuals, sound editing, and cinematography. All of these aspects are obviously above average. There were some scenes that looked beautiful and every frame of animation was smooth and looked decent, I never felt like they were \"cutting corners\" in the animation department. My favorite scene was in the bridge were Sanae confronts Yuuta and RIkka (after RIkka abandoned her delusions) and there is a clash of mental states represented through lightning and colors. The scene were Nibutani takes a crying Sanae out to the hall was pretty impressive as well. The symbolism and imagery used to represent the horizon was pretty well done in my opinion.\n\nThe opening and ending were always nice to watch.\n\nThe voice acting was nothing impressive, but I didn't felt like I was bothered by the voices either. The music was forgettable and generic. However, the use of sound effects and visual gags was done expertly. I laughed (a lot) at the duck hunt gag were Rikka finds Yuuta's \"naughty\" magazines. \n\nimg(https://static.zerochan.net/Chuunibyo.Demo.Koi.ga.Shitai%21.full.1409366.jpg)\n\n# Conclusion\n\nLove, Chunibyo & Other Delusions is a generic rom-com with a solid first half and with impressive visuals, but is hurt by its lack of self-awareness (in Rikka mainly), absence of character development, nonsensical message, horrible ending, and terrible backstories. \n\nI really wanted to like this series. After finishing episode 6 I felt like this series would be one of my favorite, However, it failed to deliver any kind of compelling character drama and its comedy soon became stale. This coupled by its contradicting message regarding delusions, made for a show that felt like a pain to watch. It had a lot going for it: cute girls, funny character interactions, and a unique enough premise. But the creators were not able to develop it correctly and now it is just a show that sounded perfect in paper, but is forgettable (at best) in reality. \n\n_I know a lot of people enjoyed this show, and I am not here to take away your happiness. I am just here to express my opinions on a show. If anyone would like to discuss (respectfully) anything that I mentioned in my review or their own opinion on the show, feel free to mention me in a forum post._"}, {"id": 3120, "score": 33, "body": "Some things need to stand alone.\n\nSequels are a gamble, especially when the time gap between original and sequel grows and grows. They tend to be put under more scrutiny than their predecessors, as they not only have to deal with standing tall as installments in their own right, but they need to provide merit as a sequel to a product that never needed one. The trickiest prospect involved is the anniversary sequel, as that is where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re most likely to enact the gambit. Some projects of this nature can pay off in a way that respects the original and becomes its own product, perhaps even succeeding it in the process. However, not everyone can do a Turn A Gundam, and instead, some make Diebuster.\n\nPut it simply, it fails both ways. As a series, it features mediocre at best and largely uninteresting characters, half-assed power-up moments, and tons of convoluted and barely explained sci-fi superpower bullshit & worldbuilding. When the highlight in terms of memorable character moments was a rape attempt, you know you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve failed, and you abandon an important sci-fi element of the original in the process, you know you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve fucked up. As a sequel, it is almost insulting. The writers made a completely different type of show -a mediocre one at that- a sequel to Gunbuster. It would be like making Aldnoah.Zero the sequel to Macross. As such, everything about the already poorly-crafted and convoluted world-building (galaxy building?) is brimming with incompatibility. \n\nBuster machines are now biomechanical machines that can only be piloted by people with some hereditary superpower gene rather than robots that take skill for any able-bodied person in general to pilot. They each come with different powers including the ability to freeze space creatures in space with quantum temperatures, and controlling and turning other ships into creatures to use during battle via psychic powers or something akin to that. They have colonized entirely new planets with futuristic military technology, yet transportation technology and all things not inherently related to war against space creatures has yet to advance beyond 2004 -the year this OVA first aired- until the finale outright contradicts that. The finale also proves that it takes place during a specific portion of the original\u00e2\u0080\u0099s finale, as if to self-destruct while getting its idol caught in the explosion. Additionally, whereas Gunbuster used real, hard science for its science fiction, Diebuster uses pseudoscience superpower nonsense. This and more serve as only a taste of how incompatible (for lack of a better word) the world-building is, and why crafting a coherent world is always important. Otherwise, we get two pieces that just cannot fit.\n\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also the fact that the mere existence of the events in Die -even discounting the monumentally awful finale- ultimately sully the finale of the original Gunbuster, as not only did it end phenomenally, but it did so in a way in which no real sequel could be warranted. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even touching on the worldbuilding element; Gunbuster ended so conclusively that to continue would be to retroactively take back part of the point of the finale. This show really should have been its own thing. It would have been a mediocre at best show, but better a mediocre separate celebration installment than a show that accidentally knocks over its predecessor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grave, especially when said predecessor became one of the two foundational anime of its studio. However, it would probably require heavy rewrites towards the end in particular. After all, the more it goes on, the worse it gets, peaking in its concluding episodes in terms of sheer atrocity, as the show stops caring almost entirely and ends up outright ruining the ending of the original. \n\nTo cover the positive -read: superficial- aspects of this asteroid, the music is better than last time, and the visuals are still mostly well-crafted. Even with the awful mech designs excessive amounts of usually terrible CGI, the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visuals are worthwhile. The character designs are fine enough -particularly that of Nono- and the action animation is smooth, kinetic, and kept track of extremely well...as long as the characters aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t running. It may not hold up compared to the immaculately detailed and stylized predecessor of yore, but disregarding that leaves you with visuals that were on par with that best at the time, at least animation-wise. The sense of scale is quite large, to add on top of that. Lastly, the music is honestly a tad superior than the original, at least when it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remixing tracks. The OP and ED themes are ok and the background music is serviceable, though that is all I can praise.\n\nUltimately, the more this show goes on, the more horrible a sequel it becomes. As if it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be a bad enough show on its own, it just had to throw a classic series under the bus in a drunken attempt at paying homage and joining a franchise. Barring the prospect of bastardizing a returning cast, Diebuster commits every sin a sequel can commit -including ones I never thought were possible- and ends up shattering itself into pieces upon its obnoxious attempts at trying to send-up and one-up. On its own, it's a mediocre turned bad show too ambitious for its own good. As a sequel, it is so...so much worse. Way to go Gainax, producing the worst thing in your mainline repertoire to celebrate 20 years!"}, {"id": 3123, "score": 30, "body": "~~~__Context:__ ~~~I watched this on the SAVE Blu-ray published by Funimation, which also included the complete original series. I consider myself a mecha fan, and one of my all time favorite shows is Neon Genesis Evangelion. I am neutral on the use of CG in anime.\n~~~__Quick, Spoiler-Free Version:__~~~If you liked the original _Fafner_ series, this movie is sure to sate your appetite for more. However, it carries over all of the problems from the first run as well. The only people I can recommend this to are __DIEHARD FAFNER FANS.__\n~~~__Full Review (CONTAINING SPOILERS)__~~~I'm just going to start this review by saying this: I think watching Fafner, and furthermore this sequel movie, has been a complete waste of time. It is mind-boggling to me that a sequel series has been produced.\n\nI'll start with animation quality. CG is fine. CG combined with regular animation techniques, also fine. CG and regular animation that doesn't move- no good. It's kind of hard to talk about animation quality, when there isn't a lot of animation to begin with. It's not as bad as in the original series, but get ready for lots of people standing and talking, sitting and talking, and panning shots of still or barely moving landscapes. What is there is really pretty looking, but when it doesn't move, well, it just becomes too noticeable.\n\nWhat about the characters? Well, H&E shuffles the deck a little bit, and deals itself one of the worst hands ever. This time, Kazuki is left alone on main character duty, with Soshi gone and Maya somehow disappearing. She's not dead, she just only shows up for the fights and a couple other scenes, where she says very little and does even less, with Canon handled in much the same way. Kenji and Sakura, aside from one quite literally one touching scene, have no development or discern able ark. Koyo also returns, conviently in an invisible form, and in a particularly hilarious scene, gets ordered to take off- whereupon we get a shot of the empty cockpit. \n\nThe other Fafner pilots are the 'junior varsity' team, made up of cheerleader level characters from the original series. Doma, whose first name I cannot be arsed to remember because he only shows up for a gag episode in the first series (before doing nothing of note except getting Mamoru's Goubain mask), has no arc. Kenji tells him not to be reckless towards the beginning,  but at the end of the movie he...recklessly jumps in front of a super-powered Festum attack. Seri is the first to remark upon the fact that the Festum appear to be saying something when they die, also does not change. Akira and Rina, brother and sister, also return, although I swear on my life Akira was not in the original series. And they kind of have an arc! They are estranged from one another... because Akira doesn't accept the loss of their parents(?)... and at the end of the movie, they pilot a Fafner together. \n\nThere are two new characters of note, Miwa Hino and Misao Kurusu. Miwa is the baby that Yumiko was pregnant with, and surprise! She's got the power to communicate with Festum and is technically a core type(?) She is pretty much a McGuffin, who has to be taken from point A to point B so we have a little plot. Amazing. Misao Kurusu is a new Festum that has been created to more directly speak with the Humans? Even though the humans were already able to speak with them through people like Miwa and Tsubaki? He struggles with his desire to end the fighting, and his inability to do so. He is also somehow protecting Soshi, so that he can be revived at the end of the film. Yup, that's right, two more pointless characters who only exist because they couldn't be written in as things! The rest of the supporting cast also returns, but they do not do much of note either, just get sick and unhappy a little bit to increase tension.\n\nSo, if you've been keeping score so far, the story is in pretty bad shape with no characters to support it. Even Kazuki can't save it, as he did the original series. The plot essentially feels like a succession of events, rather than a progression. Human force drops a bomb on the Festum's Mir. Misao shows up on the island. Festum attack the island. Fafners defeat them. More Festum show up. Fafners defeat some more. The movie lacks a definitive 'final boss,' a clear picture of a final enemy, because having Mark Nicht show up again for no real reason feels cheap and uninteresting. More should have been done with the Human force angle, since the start of this movie is based on their actions. Instead, get ready for more bland action, so repetitive and chaotic it might as well not be happening at all.\n\nThe one saving grace of this movie is the music. This was big for the original series as well, and it is once again in full effect. Even when the dialogue, writing, or action is hitting the mark, the music is. A lot of times i found myself tuning out what was happening with the music instead. The OP, ED, and Insert themes are all nice as well, but the score is the real star of this show. [Seriously, give it a listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AePhbseXYM&list=PLketLmwD3ikyITrVXh34jvNmQPm3FzmAd) even if you don't watch the show or movie.\n\nIn closing, Fafner is a show I had a lot of hope coming into, but upon leaving I am filled with nothing but regret of my wasted time. I honestly don't know who the diehard Fafner fans are, but if you're out there, sorry I'm trashing your series so much, but maybe grow some taste eh?\n\n~~~__Final Scores:__~~~ Animation: 1/2\nStory: 0/2\nSound: 2/2\nCharacters: 0/2\nEnjoyment: 0/2\n__Total Score: 3/10__"}, {"id": 3125, "score": 40, "body": "The anime adaptation of Made in Abyss last year took everyone by surprise, coming from nowhere with a surprisingly original and dark story, amidst the usual myriad of cute girls and isekai anime you get every season, including a, uh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6horse girl. Judging from the anime, it's easy to be misled that the manga will be just as good, but Made in Abyss is one of those few examples where the adaptation improves on the source material.\n\nOf course, the story itself isn't the problem, since the anime is almost a panel by panel adaptation of the manga (and for me, the small changes were for the best). However, each medium has its own sets of rules and demands for storytelling: when adapting, you can never tell the same story twice. That's why so many adaptations suffer from constant comparisons to their source material: because they are way too concerned with just telling the story without first adapting it to a whole new medium. That's why The Tatami Galaxy would never have worked as your usual ~~school~~ college anime with a Groundhog Day twist: not even Morimi's delightfully fast-paced prose could have saved another Endless Eight. That's why Houseki no Kuni worked: because they didn't just mimic the manga's minimalist art, they added their own touches and cinematographic techniques. \n\nAnd finally, that's why Kinema Citrus' anime succeeds: because it takes a manga that is not so sure of what it wants to do, and turns it into an immersive and interesting adventure fantasy story. The manga is already pretty cinematic, so that moving pictures and a great, unique soundtrack managed to create a completely different feel to it, is quite the feat.\nThat's a bold statement, so if you are here already, before picking up your rakes and rifles, bear with me.\n\nFirst off, the arcs covered by the anime are not too bad. They are pretty much the same, with some short scenes added for a more fluid storytelling and a mostly filler episode that didn't add much to it except for dramatic tension, but wasn't bad. The problem with this is that the anime does a much better job at telling the story than the manga \u00e2\u0080\u0094 granted, most credits going to the fantastic soundtrack \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and so, until chapter 26, I was stuck with the same story that I thoroughly enjoyed in the anime, but that fell completely flat when I read it.\nTsukushi's art is impressive, both in its details and creativity, but it's not enough to carry the story alone like Blame!'s or Akira's art, and reading it didn't really add much to the experience of immersing myself in the adventure. Without the soundtrack, I realized, there wasn't much to drag me into that fantastic world which, suddenly, seemed not so fantastic anymore, and emptier. The abyss is constantly labeled by the characters to be extremely dangerous and threatening, yet, if you stop to put things on a balance for a sec, the most threatening stuff until now came less from what crawls in the abyss and more from psychotic humans living in its depths. The incident with the Tamaugachi does weigh for the abyss side, but just barely. Now, while complex worldbuilding in detriment of story is not ideal, it begs the question: what's the point of creating a whole new world, sectioned in several literal layers, to the extent of defining its fauna and flora, if you are gonna linger but briefly in each of them, and for the two layers that they remained longer, spend most of the time indoors? It's almost as if the author created the world first, but didn't think about the plot very thoroughly. It's the kind of masturbatory worldbuilding that does nothing in the matter of weaving a good story. Both the manga and the anime commit the sin of being rushed, but in the latter, it is at least less apparent.\nFor the characters\u00e2\u0080\u00a6well, they weren't cardboards, but they weren't very fleshed out either. Riko and Regu aren't terrible, but they feel more like _reasons_ for the plot to move along than _the reason why_ the plot moves. I might burn myself for saying this, but, while the relationship between Nanachi and Mitty was decently played out, I feel like it manipulates us a little to feel moved. Don't get me wrong, the anime did wonders of distilling the most brutal and sentimental aspects of those more gritty scenes...but, in the end, why did I care about those characters? It wasn't because they were well written, interesting characters, but because they were kids suddenly ripped from safety and thrown into a inhospitable, ruthless world. It's an old formula, and no matter how many times it is played out, it still works. No matter the hard times they face, those characters stay essentially the same, never seeming to be significantly changed in any way, which kinda nullifies their hardships; after a while, I stopped caring altogether: which is why what I'll deal with in the next paragraph does not work (I will talk a bit later about the other characters).\n\nNow, I know this horse has been more than beaten to death already, and maybe nothing I say will add much to the topic, but still, this is a review and I have to say it.\nYes, it's about _those_ scenes. The controversial stuff. Anyway, I will keep it short ~~(I failed).~~\nSome have argued that they add _depth_ and _realism_ to the story, since, you know, they are in _that_ age. As you might have _guessed_, I fundamentally disagree with that, not because it was creepy or anything (which it _was_ \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but I'm not delving into it), but because of the _way_ the author chose to present those themes.\nIf an author actually wanted to work with the early awakening of sexuality in a relevant and serious way, there's a handful of ways they could deal with that, but none of them involve turning it into a joke __everytime__ the subject matter is brought up, without ever making any significant impact on the story or characters. It would take one hell of a good writer to fool the whole audience and make that work. Which, by the way, didn't.\nBecause, honestly, I can't even begin to conjecture how anyone could rationally convince someone else that a __12yo girl__ being tied up in a bondage style as punishment added anything worthwhile to the story, and wasn't just a gag or ~~GOD FORBID~~ fanservice. If anything, it just works to show that the adults of that world are profoundly troubled and arguably insane, but not in a credible, interesting way, but just as a means to vent the author's own probable fetishs. And honestly, denying so is just being extremely naive, as the manga is filled with borderline fetishist scenes.\nIt's the old dilemma that comic books solved two decades ago after the dark decade that was the 90s, but still sneaks and finds its way into pop culture: that adding grittiness, blood, and sex makes something mature, or even deep. It doesn't. And while it didn't ruin the story, it certainly left a sour taste in my mouth, and made me not so thrilled anymore with it.\n\nAnd presently, the manga is already two arcs after what the anime covered. I overextended myself way too much already, so I will just make a quick comment on what was probably my biggest disappointment in the manga: Bondrewd. Yes, the bad guy who did bad things in a short cameo in the anime, but was enough for everyone to hate the guy's guts.\nWhen Ozen appeared on the anime, she immediately became my favorite thing from it. She has the same problem of not being a well fleshed character, but still, when everyone's unremarkable, someone with such a strong presence and odd demeanour catches my eye, and she is at least given some reasoning for acting the way she did.\nBondrewd, however, isn't given anything. He's the epitome of evil for the sake of being evil; someone so twisted by the so called madness those who linger for too long on the abyss acquire, in the guise of a mad doctor (and I swear I can almost picture him screaming ___I AM A VISIONARY MWAHAHAHA___ in an english or german accent), that instead of being terrifying and remarkable like Ozen, it turns him into just someone that just tries too hard to be unsettling and imposing, but in the end feels like a terrible James Bond villain. The author even tries to pull another ~!mitty, with a character that gets introduced and butchered into a car battery way too fast for me to care!~ to make us hate Bondrewd even more, but it's just not effective.\n\nBut who knows, maybe all of that will be, again, improved on the second season. There certainly is potential there, specially with the awesome battle scenes this section of the manga has, but well, let's wait and see. I don't have much to say about the present arc, but it's been mildly interesting, so I'll until the conclusion to formulate any opinion on it.\n"}, {"id": 3130, "score": 40, "body": "~~~__Context__~~~ I watched this anime on the SAVE Blu-ray published by Funimation, which also includes the movie Heaven & Earth. [I reviewed that here.](https://anilist.co/review/3123) I place most importance in a story-driven anime on the story; if this were a comedy anime the characters would take priority. I enjoy mecha anime, so the fact that this is a mecha anime does not mean I automatically hate it. Trust me, it's got enough problems otherwise.\n~~~__Short Version (Spoiler-free)__~~~Fafner is a barely-animated 2004 anime series that fails to offer anything worthwhile in its 26 episodes that separate it from many other better alternatives. For me, though, it is the first time a series has been carried by its music, which is amazing. I cannot think of anyone I would recommend this to other than __People Who Use Anime To Fill A Void In Their Boring Lives.__\n~~~__Long Version(CONTAINS SPOILERS!)__~~~\"Anime\" is the Japanese word for \"Animation.\" When something is referred to as \"anime,\" you of course probably first picture the visual aesthetic that is associated with the medium, but also think of the fact that it is animated, a series of moving images, whether hand drawn or computer generated. What I'm getting at is that it's hard to judge Fafner on animation quality, when so little of it is really animated.\n\nI don't want to harp too much on this, since it can likely be chalked up to lack of funding or a time crunch, poor management, etc., factors that lie outside of the artists control. But it just feels like there's no effort. There are hundreds of scenes where people just talk to one another, with nothing done to spruce it up. Just people, with about six frames between them, just talking. Some of the fights are entertaining, but the thing about the Festum- the alien enemies of the show- is that they all attack by flashing a purple light that makes the same blackish-purple CG circle appear on things, before erasing them... quite literally, as if someone just took an eraser to the picture they were looking at. \n\nSo, one thing that makes the story suffer at the start is the confusing first battle. See, there are a couple important characters who get killed in the first episode- who I did not know immediately had died because their deaths were not properly animated. In fact, I don't even know their names, even though one of them was a main character's father. So, as the story starts with quite a few people being killed, you strap in for the melodrama and get ready for characters to start getting offed. The best way for this story to work is with a lot of character development, using the looming alien threat as a backdrop for personal conflicts.\n\nNot quite. This story has three main characters, Kazuki Matabe, Soshi Minashiro, and Maya Tomi. The supporting cast is rather large, almost to a fault. Kazuki is the leading character, and his arc consists of him trying to figure out ways to understand the people around him, more specifically Soshi, his best friend, whose eye he cut out when they were children. Soshi has alien powers for reasons mostly left unexplained, which scared Kazuki as a child, and the story of them becoming friends again is probably the most compelling one in the whole show. Maya's story is also good, as she overcomes her fear of fighting and 'changing' or losing her sense of self, to become a hero and savior of her friends.\n\nThose friends- the other Fafner pilots- unfortunately take up more screen-time and have objectively worse arcs than the mains.Let's start with Shoko- she's an invalid whose only clearly defined traits are: she's sick, and *drumroll please* she's in love with Kazuki! One-sided-ly! So, when the show focuses on her for a couple episodes, you immediately think she's going to die. She does, and here is where I think the show best establishes its major theme: it's alright to fear change and loss, but these things are necessary for survival. \n\nDespite that being the only theme I could notice in the whole show, Mamoru's arc, rushed in towards the end of the show's run, seems to contradict everyone else's arc. Koyo and Sakura both refuse to change, and both suffer greatly as a result, tortured from the assimilation phenomenon which slowly kills the pilots as they operate Fafners. Mamoru, however, gives up his Goubain personality, expresses both verbally and in his actions a desire to protect his friends and to change, and just when he's become stronger and more self-actualized- he dies. This guy undergoes more development than 95% of the supporting cast, and his reward is death? Oh, are we going to play the nihilism card, Tow Ubukata, you f***ing hack?\n\nSpeaking of terrible writing, let's talk about what this show calls 'world-building' and 'story'. I should honestly add about 20 more quotation marks to each side of those words. Very little is of the 'science' of the technology the characters utilize is actually explained, which would be fine if it had any discernible rules. How can the Festum read minds? Why can they predict some attacks but not others? Why do the Fafners block the mind reading, and why has the technology not been implemented so their island can never be found? How did the humans develop a drug to implant the 'Festum factor' that allows them to be Fafner pilots? How did the Festum sterilize the Japanese? Why? And if that wasn't enough questions, let's look at some story elements that raise questions.\n\nShoko's grave gets defiled because she self destructs her Fafner. Why are there no consequences to this? How are there Neo U.N. spies on the island? Why do they not initiate a coup? Why does Dr. Bertrand not forcibly take over the island? Exactly how many Festum are there, and why do they not reinforce the North Pole more efficiently if it is the 'backbone' of their operations? Who is Tsubaki? Why do she and her older brother have alien powers? How do they 'teach' the Festum things? Why don't all assimilated humans teach them things? Wouldn't the 'war' end after they assimilated, like, one human? \n\nThe dialogue is terrible, which I think is a crime because there is way too much of it. Despite being a visual medium, so much of the show is devoted to just talking, which usually falls into one of two categories when it isn't main characters talking. The first is boring crap, fluff that seems to only exist to draw out screen time, such as romances and mini-arcs that are forgettable and add no value to the plot. The second are opaque, overly complicated messes of exposition and pseudo-science that just make absolutely no sense. For all I know, some of those questions I listed earlier may have been answered, but I could not tell you because this story feels like it was written to be as complex as possible, which is ironic when you consider the fact that most of the main characters spend their time trying to understand one another better. \n\nSo to sum up the story and characters together: Most of them are pointless. It all feels like wasted potential. There are so many scenes where I was supposed to feel happy or sad, but I didn't because the story just fails to make me feel attached to most of the characters or their fate.\n\nOne thing that did make me feel emotion consistently, however was the score. The music in this show is god-tier. Even while the writing fails to make you feel anything, the music will do the trick. Even the kicking opening and mellow closer are packed with more emotion than the actual show. As I stated in the short review of this show, what kept me invested was the score, and it's what kept me coming back other than the fact that I spent $20 on the BD.\n\nTo conclude, the only way I can recommend this anime is if you just have nothing else to watch. Trust me, you'll think of something better to do while you're watching this, like going to the DMV or filing your taxes. That's right, dealing with the f***ing bureaucratic nightmares presented by the American government is more enjoyable than watching this dumpster fire.\n~~~__Final Scores:__~~~Animation: 1/2\nStory:0/2 \nSound: 2/2\nCharacters: 1/2\nEnjoyment: 0/2\n__Total Score: 4/10__"}, {"id": 3135, "score": 1, "body": "Yeah it is pretty bad. There were some scenes I thought were kinda pretty but they were all superseded by the overwhelmingly cheap looking doughy animation. The ugly and aesthetically dissonant designs really took away from my enjoyment of the film as I wanted to gag at every new jumbled hodgepodge of a character design that appeared. Even the titular Darkside who is clearly supposed to be this cool suave guy looks absolutely disgusting with his vampire-like cape and cowboy boots complete with spurs. Imagine if Dracula looked exactly the same but was wearing cowboy boots, that's what Darkside looks like. The aesthetics of the films were not clearly defined and in my opinion I felt that Angel's Egg did something similar but better. \n\nI *think* the plot was supposed to be about a vigilante group that's fighting a dictatorship / corporate monopoly that owns 99% of the world but the film never actually explains a lot of crucial plot points. Moreover the entire time there's just this floating magical god guy that helps them out sometimes (Darkside)?? He just appears from a flying horse drawn carriage out of a hole in the ground and his motivations for being there are never ever explained. He's just there aiding the main characters at times but this doesn't seem to be his main objective? He \"heals\" the other characters somehow by reading their minds but again the reason for this is never explained either. There's some skinny brat who may or may not have magical powers that everyone respects for some reason. There were too many characters and all with no likeable or memorable defining characteristics to speak of. They also try to do this plot twist at the end but it made no sense. It was absolute mess from beginning to end and I regret wasting my time watching it. Bafflingly it felt like simultaneously way too much and not enough was accomplished over the course of the film and I felt completely apathetic towards what was going on.\n\nI can't say much for the music and sound design it was all so forgettable. \n\nOverall it was a poorly executed political allegory that tried to deal with the idea of \"what do we sacrifice in the name of peace?\" but it lacked focus. It was poor on all fronts and led to a very unsatisfying watch."}, {"id": 3144, "score": 0, "body": "I started watching this anime with one simple goal: to figure out if it's wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon.

0/100 for misleading title."}, {"id": 3145, "score": 13, "body": "Sword Art Online is a controversial anime, and while it is heavily flawed (especially the Alfeim arc), it has certain appeal and has plenty of entertainment value, as long as expectations are managed. Unfortunately, none of the positives from the first season of Sword Art Online transfer to the second season.\n\nWhere the first season of Sword Art Online failed, the second season manages to exacerbate the failures, and where the first season succeeded, the second season does not succeed. For the sake of brevity and simplicity, the season can be divided into three arcs, all of which are completely and utterly unrelated except for their title (more on that later); Death Gun, Excalibur, and Mother's Rosario. Death Gun as an arc is \"okay\" for those that enjoyed the first season, but the rest of the show lacks anything positive, entertaining, or interesting, unless the watcher is a very, very dedicated fan.\n\nThe Death Gun arc is by a unspeakably large margin the best part of the season, with a sense of urgency, danger and simple mystery that goes well with the first season. To put the arc into simple terms, a VRMMO game called Gun Gale Online has a problem, people are dying by a player's hand in the game. In real life. But no worries, this arc is ended with a grand total of __ three__ player deaths with an unsatisfying and predictable ending with Kirito basically forgetting the events two episodes later. Be that as it may, seeing Kirito be Kirito again is fun, even if it is quite bland, and we see plenty of character development for him as a person post the events of season one and the psychological issues that come with what happened. Sinon's character is also decent if cookie cutter, with a conflict and a goal of resolution. Does that resolution come? Partially, and she as a character is almost entirely forgotten the minute the arc ends. \n\nThe Excalibur arc has no place outside of a 2 OVA side story series. It can be summed up as such: A part of Alfeim has a nice shiny sword, here's some lore about the game, and here's some lazy fight scenes. Some nice feel-good scenes with Kirito, Asuna and Yui to transition into mother's rosario. Done. The entirety of the arc is insultingly simple and boring. Some nice art of the Alfeim landscape isn't enough to tame the boredom that is produced by any watcher other than the most die-hard fans of Sword Art Online as a franchise. \n\nMother's Rosario is based around Asuna (or a character that looks like Asuna with the same name, that is) making a friend followed by a needlessly depressing ending to the season. Add in some frustrating and angering exposition with Asuna's mother and the other inconsequential characters doing nothing on the sidelines. \n\nEach arc could potentially be completed in two episodes, maybe three, each. Instead, we are greeted with 24 episodes of almost entirely pointless story telling that contains shells of Sword Art Online characters. Elaborating on the point about the arcs being unrelated, that goes for the season and season one as well. For almost the entire season, it's almost like Kirito and Asuna don't even know each other, saying nothing about them supposedly being in love. Every other character is along for the ride of whatever poorly written short story has been shoved into the mouth of the viewer. The characters featured in Sword Art Online II are nothing more than drawings with the same names and appearances of the characters from season one. Any of the character and depth they had before is almost entirely missing spare for Kirito in the Death Gun arc. \n\nThis dry, flavorless cake is topped by a cherry of recycled music, perfectly average art, and a obvious and painful lack of love, effort, and soul put into the production of the anime. Sword Art Online II is an unfortunate victim to almost every single thing that can be done wrong in an anime, and short of helplessly obsessed fans of the first season, provides very little entertainment value past the lackluster at best first arc, because everything that follows is boring to the point of being inflammatory and frustrating.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCovering the dub:\n\nThe dub is just as bad as it was in the first season, with the same extreme over enthusiasm as the first season. Somehow though this season manages to be worse, especially accounting for the lack of emotion in the characters as a whole.

That latter part alone should have made me wary enough, but hey, call me an idiot.\nI should have known better than to fall for the \"hentai with a plot\" deception, but after seeing this thing everywhere, I had to take a look for myself.\n\nThe plot is very simple: a girl changes her appearances as a means to change her life. This one good decision led her to bad decision after another in order to get her into the most deviant and abhorrent sexual situations possible.\n...that's it. That's the whole manga. To sum it up, it was the narrative equivalent of throwing a dead dog into the story so people would feel sorry for it. This may sound harsh, but it really has nothing going for it other than sheer shock value. It clearly worked, considering how popular it got, but it takes little retrospection to see how terrible it was.\n\nSomehow, I've seen this manga being labeled as a \"coming of age\" countless times, even on the tags here \u00e2\u0080\u0094 only that, you know, coming of ages usually features growth, introspection and choices made by the main characters. The story wants you to believe it does that, but from the first page to the last, Saki never gets to be anything else than a vapid, empty character only meant for channeling sexual depravity, as if we didn't already have plenty of those around. The only kind of introspection she ever gets until the bitter end is things like _oh no I don't know what I'm doing_ or _I loooove sex_, which tells a lot about the choices her character is ever given: either if her actions are influenced by other people, drugs, or her unnatural craving for sex (always external factors, not once her own resolve), in the end it doesn't really matter: all of them are just excuses for her to get into more sex, and even if she is for a moment shown to be conscious that something's wrong, it doesn't really matter: she does it anyway.\n\nAlong the way, in those aforementioned facebook posts, somehow Saki started being called the \"female Punpun\" (as well comparisons with other characters, like Shinji and even Bojack Horseman). However, even Inio Asano was conscious enough that a whole story centred around a sad boy jacking off in his room wasn't enough for people to take it seriously. What made Punpun interesting was his sprawling cast of side characters, that introduced all kinds of nuances of morality and points of view into the story. Although Punpun ultimately kept his self-destructive and egocentric personality, he was never given a shortage of options and paths to take. Through all his life he was introduced to both evil and good, irresolute and more determined people, people that tried to help him and that only made him become worse. It was this diversity that made the story, the universe, and Punpun's character believable: nothing was ever only black or white, there was myriads of color that influenced its characters, and even though the story maintained a harsh look at reality which felt like punch after punch in the guts, it never subdued to shallow pessimism. This also reflects on the opinions people have about Punpun: some pity him, claiming he was a victim of odds, some consider him to be the absolute worst.\nHenshin, however, does not have that: every single character is depicted as despicable and egotistical, always leading Saki into a even more disgruntled spiral of helplessness even if it meant acting in completely unrealistic ways (like a mother who's so oblivious she immediately believes her husband's claims of being seduced by their own daughter without even considering listening to her side of things), which makes the story completely unbelievable and dumb. Even the one character who shows the least bit of kindness does so as just a way for the plot to spat harsh truths and making Saki even more miserable. It tries too hard to make us care about its main character by introducing her to gradually more and more screwed up situations, forcing the reader to evoke a sense of shallow pity, instead of making her an actually interesting character. It's even sadder to see people deeming her as a \"strong\" character, when she does nothing but be carried by the plot instead of carrying it, which is not a demonstration of strength, at all.\n\nAt first, I thought at least the art could be reedemable: the artist did a good job of distilling eroticism out of it by making the H-scenes seem coarse and raw \u00e2\u0080\u0094 only, it wasn't actually doing that. By taking a quick check at the artist's other works, it seems like this is his actual style: somewhat bloated bodies, exaggerated anatomy, and themes such as humiliation and borderline rape (coming to things like anthropomorphic sex roosters(?)). It even makes use of the ahegao face, which, as weird as it may be, has become a sprawling fetish as of late, so it's hard to defend that those scenes weren't intended for at least ___some___ kind of audience to enjoy. It's as if a well known lolicon H-artist suddenly decided to draw a very graphic manga to make a point about child abuse; for anyone aware of their background, it just sounds like plain and disgusting irony. It simply doesn't add up.\n\nOn trying to see how chaotic he could get from the simple premise of self-improvement, different from Asano, the author forgot the most important: to write a good story, that wasn't just self-deprecating onanism.\nIn the end, Henshin is just your average hentai doujinshi, only it's not really appealing unless you're into some really screwed up stuff, and it doesn't work as a story of any kind, so I got absolutely nothing out of it rather than disgust and a deep impression of lost time and that the people who revere it should find better, healthier hobbies."}, {"id": 3174, "score": 1, "body": "I didn't really know what I was bringing myself into but boy was I both suprised and shocked: however not in the way you'd expect. I knew instantly after watching this OVA that i absolutely needed to write a review to let everyone know about this masterpiece.\n\nStory 10/10\nI. LOVE. IT. The story is extraordinarily excecuted I might even say to perfection. Every single act has been so meticulously crafted to pull at your heart strings when needed, so much so it feels like you're about to die. Like literally die. Everyone is memorable and leave a huge impact on both the audience and the plot. When that blue haired girl got blasted to the face and the green haired girl went 'oh no' I. FELT. THAT. They kept her alive after the main character (talk about that later) has a significant development and kills like 1 person and then dies to save her. However, after being brought to the hospital after their best efforts (off screen) the doctor stares in dismay at the girl with her fucking head blown off and says 'it's too late for her'. The irony that they saved the main character but couldn't save her really shakes you off your feet as you were previously thinking that there's no way she's going to be cut off so early in the show but think again, bucko. There are even moments more shocking like when that big bad guy told 'innocent' small boy that they are the true earthlings. The plot twisted harder than a fat man trying to take the cap off his seventh mt. dew bottle and on a completely and utterly inspirational - kinda makes you think about life uno? Needless to say, I was surprised that it wasn't one of Shinkai's works\n\nCharacters 10/10\nLike I said, the mecha suit guy is probably one of the most recognised characters and blue haired girl will always be my best girl but ngl my favourite was probably the big bad guy cause he wasn't even in the wrong. Mecha suit guy too much of a fucking pussy and green haired girl didn't do shit for her friends except call reinforcements when they were overwhelmed. The character development really struck a chord with me as I really relate to having to be forced to wear the special anti-ancient armor gear by my dad (we haven't been on good terms ever since) and it really gives me a kick to see other people making the best of the very same situation. The other reviews don't really care to talk pick up about this but i'm surprised they didn't highlight the art of the dialogue. In order to not spoil to much but my favourite's have got to be when the doctor said 'She ain't making this one' and the ship guy when they were burning up and he said 'we're burning up'.\n\nArtistic design and Animation 10/10\n2005 this aired? Wow steins; gate must be based on a true story because they sure did send this gift from the future! Never seen more perfectly stitched frames and the character's idle actions sure do match with their on screen personas. Wait did you notice I said animation? Well if you are the same as me after spending hours watching countless reviews to fully unwrap the ending (which I am still struggling to decode the ambigious meaning/s ) you couldn't find the character's real names so you could find their adresses and send them fan mail :( well thats because (still in the third stage of disbelief) they were not actually real! It's completely computer sketched. Amazing right! Ah the wonders of the future. Each frame moves fluildy from one to next as if they were part of a continuum beyond the feeble physical realms of space and time. If you still cannot understand what I am hinting towards I shall say it clear: I'm lead to believe God himself has literally drawn every single frame.\n\nSound 10/10\nNot much to say about this one as I was too distracted by the plot but nevertheless smooth tranisitions between songs and sound effects were like the real thing. Beethoven really did a number on this.\n\nEnjoyment factor 10/10\nNeed something to watch with friends? Watch this\nNeed a good horror to scare you at wits end? Watch this\nNetflix and chill isn't working too well? Watch this\nTaking a massive shit and you think you wont be out for 19 minutes 35 seconds? Watch this!\nToo many options to enjoy it and will always bring a smile to your face.\nReplayability really isn't a problem\n\nSummary\nIt may be a motion picture, animation, japanese anime BUT I have NEVER seen something so perfect, so endearing than this short OVA.

I'll try to keep it concise. There will be spoilers up ahead.\n\nI've watched a lot of anime, and I tend to give them pretty high scores, mostly because I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to thing I enjoy. But this anime is easily the least enjoyable thing I've had the displeasure of watching in a very long time, with the exception of School Days.\n\nFor starters, if you're unfamiliar with the story, it's about Medaka Kurokami, a perfect and amazing girl with massive... charisma, and her objective is to solve the problems of the students of her academy with the help of the Student Council members, which she recruits as the series goes on.\n\nIn theory, the character of Medaka is meant to be a parody of Shonen heroes, being overpowered and having all sorts of nonsensical abilities (most of which aren't showcased in this season, but if you've seen the later parts of the manga, you'd know how absurdly broken Medaka gets). However, the problem with being a parody is that you can't just expect people to laugh about the concept of a joke character, when the \"joke\" is played completely straight.\nI hate comparisons like these, but I feel that it would make my point easier to understand. Take a look at Saitama from One Punch Man. Saitama takes the concept of an overpowered character in a universe full of characters below his league, and it uses that to show how dull and depressing it really is to be better than everyone.\nOn the other hand, Medaka Box does the absolute opposite of this. Medaka and everyone else in the show knows about how wonderful and perfect she is, with only a few unfortunate fools having the guts to defy her. Needless to say, those foes tend to get instantly humiliated. There is one occasion in which Medaka is the one to lose, but it's played so poorly that even a kid would be able to predict it, and it does not even have negative repercussions for Medaka in the long run.\n\nAnd when you take a look at the supporting cast, they're not any better at all. You have your underdog companion that's totally not head over heels for Miss Perfect; the \"funny\" loli that's always eating stuff or messing with underdog-kun; the other boy who is in love with Medaka, but doesn't actually bother hiding it; and the female character who starts off as a rival but then joins the team after getting kissed by Medaka (yes, it's as stupid as it sounds). Oh, and let's not forget the myriad of one-off characters that don't actually have any contribution to the plot other than to add filler!\nLastly, the main villain (whose name I didn't even bother to remember), is supposed to be menacing and strong enough to put an end to Medaka's reign, gets utterly humiliated after explaining his extremely boring and unmemorable motive. The worst part is that even after the overly-long speech about Medaka's \"ideals\", and the buildup for the villain's defeat, Medaka instantly forgives him and tells him to join the student council. I get that this is supposed to be \"funny\", but it just isn't. At all. It turns a somewhat valid antagonist into a zero.\n\nAfter the final battle is done, the last episode of the season is... a filler one about shogi (Japanese chess). And it was just as boring as it sounds.\n\nAnd even when considering all my gripes with the writing, I still can't find a reason to like this series.\nThe designs were decent and flowed well in motion, but in comparison to other Gainax works, it feels cheap and mediocre. It looks more like something you'd expect out of A-1 Pictures.\nNone of the designs really stood out, and some of them are so similar to each other that you can easily confuse the characters.\n\nThe sound design was not bad per se, but there's absolutely nothing memorable in it. The opening and endings were pretty generic and there's not even a sound effect that stuck with me.\n\nBut on the bright side, the show is pretty short, and the abundant fanservice is at least pleasant to the eye, as excessive as it may be at times.\n\nSo overall, I cannot recommend this series. It tries too hard to be a parody without actually being funny, and it lacks the self-awareness that could've saved that concept.\n\nPlease do yourself a favor and avoid watching this series at all costs."}, {"id": 3189, "score": 30, "body": "A long time ago, I found a bottle floating in the ocean off the coast of Santa Monica. It contained a lengthy research paper, allegedly belonging to a renowned pair of married scientists who had disappeared at sea years prior. I never told anyone about this paper\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I mean, after I read it, how could I? It spoke of concepts that frightened me, and the idea of handing it over to anyone in authority chilled me to the bone. I could never hand this thesis over to my own government, because I just knew someone would try to use the information contained within to develop weapons that could destroy the very fabric of existence as we knew it. See, this thesis spoke of alternate timelines\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I know, big shock right? The multiverse has been existing in the minds of scientists for years now, but here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the thing Never has the method for accessing those timelines been so perfectly realized.\n\nThe paper spoke of a unique world where everything\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And I mean everything, from the movement of the stars to the fate and decisions of every individual human\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Revolved around the whims of one perfect teenage boy, who thankfully was too apathetic to harness his true powers, with which he could easily mobilize an army of obsessive, sexually-frustrated moe girls. Out of all the millions of alternate versions of this universe, there were some where people believed his plight to be pinnacle of emotional depth and perfection in story-telling\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And in other realities, people claimed that his story was sick, pathetic wish fulfillment and tragedy porn. And that, in heavily simplified terms, is how you access these multiple realities\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 You create a universe so divisive that every single person who experiences it has a radically different experience with it, and accept that every single one of those opinions is somehow correct.\n\nThat world is called Clannad, and it is beautiful. I mean aesthetically, and in terms of animation? This show is gorgeous. Unsurprisingly, it was produced by Kyoto Animation, the patron saints of good looking anime, and as you may have expected from my only other Kyoto Animation review (Free), Clannad obviously had a lot of love and money poured into it   A wide range of motion and visual effects is used throughout the series, effortlessly switching between the mundane shots of people walking and talking together, to the fast paced actions shots of over-the-top fights breaking out on campus, to beautiful CGI that gets used sparingly and never looks out of place, and at no point is it ever apparent that the producers had to bother saving a single penny.\n\nWell, that turns out to have been a very good choice, because this series is based on a KEY visual novel, which means it carries with it a very distinct sort of design. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen the term \u00e2\u0080\u009cMoe-blob\u00e2\u0080\u009d used to describe this design, where male characters have reasonably realistic facial proportions but their female counterparts have giant, tumorous doe-eyed countenances, and it certainly applies here, as this is the kind of show that would look like walking garbage if it weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t produced with the budget of a small country. PA Works might have been a better fit, but comparison aside, Kyoto Animation knew exactly what they were doing with this title. Big eyes can easily look like dead eyes, but Kyo-Ani took full advantage of those giant peepers in order to channel an entire spectrum of emotions that breathe full, vibrant life into what would otherwise be unrealistic and unrelatable visual novel tropes.\n\nLike the animation, the music is diverse, had a lot of love and attention put into it, and can cover a wide variety of moods, and it works\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Most of the time? Okay, positives first, emotional highlights are very well tended to, and the music that plays during those \u00e2\u0080\u0098other world\u00e2\u0080\u0099 segments is hauntingly appropriate. The Insert song \u00e2\u0080\u009cDango Daikazoku\u00e2\u0080\u009d appears very prominently as an in-universe song that the cast is aware of, as well as the ending theme for the series. Where the soundtrack unfortunately falters is in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quieter, more mundane moments, where characters are just standing around talking. The music playing in support of these moments could best be described as generic, as it sounds like plenty of these tracks were ripped directly from the backgrounds in the game and played on loop. Honestly, there are times throughout the series where those tracks just wind up coming off as annoying, overpowering the dialogue rather than supplementing it.\n\nAnd as for the dub\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Oh boy. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re about to enter sticky territory with this one. Granted I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been in this territory before, but not under these circumstances, so bear with me. In fall of 2014, veteran ADR director Steven Foster quit his job with Sentai filmworks. In a very revealing interview, he later trashed many of the shows he had worked on, relating the intense fan hatred of his work to the fact that the work itself was unsalvageable. One of these shows was Clannad, which he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand and found entirely unrelatable, so he basically just covered his ass by casting people he knew he could trust to handle the roles. Ever since release, Clannad has been considered one of the worst english dubs of all time, the quintessential example of Mr. Foster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dubious talents, and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really get why.\n\nOkay, let me start off by saying I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think this dub is very good. There are tons of little hiccups in the dialogue, such as awkwardly worded lines like \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that retired charismatic musician\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know where the taking seriously even begins with you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d that would honestly sound right at home coming out of the mouths of Johnny and his best friend Mark, but in my opinion, Foster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s instincts were more or less spot-on when it came to casting this show. David Matranga is one of my favorite voice actors of all time, and while he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s limited to deep voiced characters, he can utilize a lot of humor and drama within that limit, which made him the perfect choice for the main character, a 17 year old delinquent with a troubled home life and a penchant for pulling pranks. Luci Christian turned up the kawaii-ness to play his gentle and sensitive love interest, and Greg Ayres was on fire in his typecast role as Sunohara, even if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll admit his character was changed from interesting to insufferable in the rewrites.\n\nI mentioned in my Angel Beats review that Emily Neves was a bit on the mediocre side, and that her co-stars were way out of her league. Was that too mean of me? Well, I hope this redeems me\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Following Angel Beats, she got really good, really fast. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s turned into a very subtle and natural sounding actor, which helped to save the otherwise questionable character of Kotomi, and of course, Hilary Haag was a natural choice to play the dippy Fuko. My only serious complaint is with the two twins Ryou and Kyou, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry, but as good as Shelley Callene-Black can be when handled properly, she sounds like a forty year old, and has no business playing a teenager\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Even a gruff one. Brittany Karbowski plays her more diminutive sister to a somewhat better degree, but it kills me to hear such a multitalented actor get stuffed into such a one note role. I kind of wish they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d cast her as both sisters, using different tones and speech patterns for each. But aside from that, I have no idea why the dub is so reviled, because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nowhere near as bad as Angel Beats was, and I see no problem in recommending both languages.\n\nAs for Steven Foster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other complaints? Well, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m personally of the opinion that an ADR director shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t call a project unsalvageable, even if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a terrible show in general. Master of Martial Hearts has to be one of the worst anythings I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen, but damn it if Funimation didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put all of their effort into dubbing that turkey. No anime is bad enough that dubbing it is a waste of time, and if you think it is, you should probably hand the responsibilities to somebody else, rather than slogging through a project you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to do. Having said that, I will very begrudgingly admit that his comments about this particular series aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t entirely unfounded.\n\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll start with the obvious one; He claims Clannad is difficult to understand. This is sadly true for a lot of people, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll freely confess that I was taking the supernatural elements of the series with a grain of salt until somebody sat down and explained them to me. In addition to the main story, which is somewhat confusing in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own right, there are two plot lines that can leave viewers scratching their heads. The first is the multiple universes, an idea that gets brought up in seemingly random fashion until you smack your head for overthinking it and write it off as an excuse to have different paths from the game adapted into OVA episodes. At least it makes more sense here than when Umineko tried to explain it. The other is a strange, haunting subplot about a lonely little girl building herself a sentient robot friend and bouncing existential questions off of him. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also magic tying emotions to the town, and once I had it explained to me it DID make some of the more questionable occurrences seem clearer, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have to be paying extra close attention during the sequel series to pick up on any of that for yourself, and none of it really adds any depth to the story, they just explain things a bit. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d go as far as to say there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no shame in just taking the supernatural material with a grain of salt.\n\nSo what about his other complaint, that he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t relate to the characters? Well, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like saying Peter Griffin would make a bad party guest. There is nothing realistic or believable about literally any of the characters in this show, the things they do, the things they say, or the way they relate to each other, and this can all be connected back to the fact that it was based on a visual novel. A visual novel, for people who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, is a text-heavy dating game where you pick the romantic option you like the most out of a handful of options, and perform tasks to raise their affection levels so you can pork them. Turning this format into a series is not an easy thing to do, I admit, but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t excuse any show from sucking at it.\n\nRemember how in Toradora, the main character started off without a single girl interested in him, and he eventually wormed his way into the hearts of three girls as they got to know him and understand his value? Well, out of Tomoya Okazaki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s options, there are two girls who already love him right from the get go, one who loves him but is in denial, and two who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t immediately love him but instantly trust and get along with him. To be fair, the writers took the extra effort to give him a personality, but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make up for him and Nagisa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parents being the only characters with any emotional depth. Sunohara\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entire purpose is to act like an obnoxious pervert just to make Tomoya seem more cool as a result(and he gets worse in season 2), and the female characters run the gamut from infantile pansies to obsessed harpies whose every goal in life revolves somehow around either winning Tomoya or giving him tasks to complete to win them.\n\nAnd that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basically how the plot of this anime unfolds\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 On the path to completing the main quest, for the main girl, Tomoya has to complete various tasks to satisfy the other minor arcs, for the other girls. Each accomplishment unlocks a new girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s challenge, which frustrates me to no end. According to Clannad, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t form or strengthen a relationship with somebody without doing elaborate chores for them. In order to get somebody to come out of their room, you have to weed their yard and plant a new flower garden for them. If you want to get someone elected student council president, you have to take them around and have them participate in a bunch of athletic club activities, which they couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t possibly do themselves. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t confess your feelings to a girl who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obviously showed signs of liking you since episode 3 until you take her by the hand and practically drag her through all the processes of starting and maintaining the club she kinda sorta wanted to join, and no, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not making any of that up.\n\nEssentially, Clannad\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 This oh so romantic classic\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Paints dating in such a way that perpetuates the classic toxic attitude of entitlement. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to worry about physical attraction, mutual respect, chemistry, or any of that complicated stuff\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 If you paid fifty dollars for dinner and she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put out, something must be broken in the game. From date rape to people simply getting pissed that you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t thank them for saying God Bless You, entitlement is an ugly thing, especially when you force yourself upon peoples\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lives in ways they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want or need. As Parker J. Palmer put in a recent column called The Gift of Presence, The Perils of Advice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe human soul doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be advised or fixed or saved. It simply wants to be witnessed \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to be seen, heard and companioned exactly as it is. When we make that kind of deep bow to the soul of a suffering person, our respect reinforces the soul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s healing resources, the only resources that can help the sufferer make it through.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo, why does Tomoya feel the need to meddle in every single thing? Why can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he just connect with people on an interpersonal level? Because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supposed to be able to insert yourself into this character, and if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the target audience for visual novels\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Lonely Japanese men who can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get laid because women refuse to marry early out of fear that the legal bondage of marriage will destroy their hopes of having a career\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Are presented with simple binary choices from women who are already openly accepting of the idea of polishing his knob, and will happily reward him for making all of their clearly and explicitly established dreams come true. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d just like to point out that I was diagnosed with Asperger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s syndrome at age 4. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m legitimately socially retarded, and this shit even sounds pathetic to me.\n\nThe reason I started this review off with a sarcastic plot synopsis is because I just didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to describe the plot accurately without jumping right into some of my negative comments. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of stuff that happens throughout the series, but since I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m only reviewing the first season in this post, the usable plot boils down to who Tomoya is going to pick, which is a very hard climax to relate to any of the melodrama that set it up, especially since the reward it was driving towards was something that could have been taken care of within a six episode ova. God forbid the series starred normal people, or the important love connection could have been made THAT early, cutting off the most obvious will-they-wont-they scenario since Love Hina right off at the pass.\n\nSo now that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gotten all of that off my chest, was there anything redeeming about this series? Yes, and quite a bit. Out of all the story arcs, with Tomoya leading hapless child-like girls around by the wrist while they thirst for his dick, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one arc featuring a much more believable child who DOESN\u00e2\u0080\u0099T have a wide-on for him. That girl is Fuko, and if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able to ignore the egregiously unfunny Suzohara/Tomoyo skits that happen throughout, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s by far the most compelling arc of this season. What she wants, where she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming from and what she has to go through is damn near tear-jerking, and it feeds into the main plot way more than the others. And aside from that, there are a lot of jokes that are objectively funny, and none of them involve the comic relief character, Sunohara. Hell, Tomoya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s practical jokes are the funniest content available, and his joke on Sunohara just happens to be the one that drags on for too long. Unfortunately, a handful of good jokes don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make up for a truckload of bad ones, so take what you can get, I guess?\n\nClannad is available from Sentai Filmworks. It can be purchased in affordable quarters if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not interested in the dub, but if you are, good luck, because after over five years, the sixty dollar price tag has only dropped to about 40 dollars as an occasional sale price. The set comes packaged with a special OVA episode replacing the main girl with one of the side girls, and it exists. A second season called After Story is also available, and while pricing is virtually the same, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be reviewing that very soon. A film is also available stateside, but true to Key\u00e2\u0080\u0099s roots, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only a cash-grab retelling of the series. There are tons of manga and game entries that are available in Japan, but as far as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m aware(correct me if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m wrong) none of them have been released stateside, as visual novels are not as familiar a thing to westerners as they are to Japan.\n\nHave you ever wondered why this anime is called Clannad, and what connection(if any) it has to the Irish band of the same name? Well, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a funny story behind that. Jun Maeda picked it because he mistakenly believed it was the gaelic word for family. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not, of course, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually a portmanteau of two different words essentially referring to an old Gaelic clan. Not only does this story never fail to impress other nerds at parties, but it also illustrates what sets Clannad apart from the other visual novel shows of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ilk\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The fact that it is so ungodly pretentious. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so easy to laugh at the \u00e2\u0080\u0098deeper\u00e2\u0080\u0099 subplots as soon as you hear the phrase \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe magic orbs are just dragon balls.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t agree with the people who claim that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the worst anime of all time, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather not have any physical contact with people who call it one of the best anime of all time, but I guess I can understand where both parties are coming from. Me, I think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s merit to this series, and that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth seeing based on it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s technical prowess and the obvious amount of ambition that went into it, but over-all, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this kind of emotionally manipulative, cliche-ridden, socially out-of-touch series that the word \u00e2\u0080\u0098overrated\u00e2\u0080\u0099 was invented for. I give Clannad a 3/10. "}, {"id": 3190, "score": 40, "body": "Once upon a time, Tomoya Okazaki had been depressed. The child of a single, alcoholic parent and a delinquent at school, there was nothing in the world for him to live for, and he knew it. That was before he met Nagisa Furukawa, a sweet, docile, anemic girl with a dream to live and no strength or will to see it through. With the help of a strange bevy of friends and romantic options, Tomoya was able to guide the girl through the hard times that came her way, pulling her over every obstacle and believing in her until that dream could be realized\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And once it was over, she had practically no choice but to pay him back by becoming his girlfriend.\n\nIn most anime, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where the story would end, but here, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not so simple\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Their relationship is only the beginning of a winding tale of fate that will affect the boundaries of reality itself. As they leave behind high school\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Along with their friends, Tomoya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s need to help people, and the hearts of half a dozen other girls\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And embark on their journey into adulthood and the real world. This means taking a bold, courageous leap into independence, responsibility, and consequences as they get jobs and learn to support each other. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re warned that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be trouble along the way, but nobody could possibly guess just how much heartbreak and tragedy is awaiting them\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Because surviving high school and becoming a couple may be the beginning, even marital bliss is far from the ending.\n\nLike it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s predecessor, Clannad Afterstory was produced by famed studio Kyoto Animation, the crown kings of the moe art style(A1 is the queen)\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And yet it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look quite the same. The over-all style of Kyoto Animation is well known to have changed drastically in the mid to late 2000s, and a lot of people blame the financial success of K-On! for this shift\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Their artwork used to be very solid and consistent even at it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most active moments, but following this change, faster on-screen motion looks a lot cheaper, as though they found a more affordable method of capturing motion without sacrificing speed or energy\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unfortunately highly noticeable, and it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look nearly as impressive as their work from the first half of the decade.\n\nBasically, it started to look Gainax-y. Honestly, though, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really think K-on! is to blame for this. Clannad Afterstory is their earliest work where I actually noticed this change, although it looks more prototypical compared to K-on. I mentioned in my last review how the artists were able to create life in the eyes of their female characters, and while their eyes don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look quite as dead as I implied a drop in the budget would make them, they do still have their iffier moments. This can make faster fluid movements can appear choppy or cheap looking at times\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably at it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worst when Akio is moving his arms to rap\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But thankfully, after the first eight episodes, bigger actions are few and far between, leaving a decent amount of money available for the rare CG effects and some of the better moments towards the end.\n\nThe music really hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t changed since my last review, so there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a whole lot I can say about it. Instead, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll talk about the opening and ending, both of which are apparently beloved. Despite the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s step down in animation quality, the opening looks a LOT better in Afterstory, despite their similarities. The song is Toki wo Kizamu Uta by Key veteran Lia, it not only sounds but also looks far more interesting than the generic, snooze worthy track that opened it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s predecessor. This opening begins rapturously, showcasing the supernatural lights and shots of the town on a far more visually arresting note. One thing I found odd is that even though the series has left behind it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s harem-y roots, it still announces the game\u00e2\u0080\u0099s romantic options in the opening. They had the good sense to get rid of Fuko, but that still leaves Kotomi, Tomoyo and Kyou, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve all been largely downgraded to supporting roles in what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supposed to be Tomoya and Nagisa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story.\n\nThe English dub has also greatly improved, with Steven Foster taking less and less of a role in the show before moving on from it completely. Clint Bickham is a decent writer who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very good at transforming Japanese idioms and turn of phrase into something more accessible to Western viewers without bastardizing it. Janice Williams takes over directorial duties, and while Foster was a producer on the dub, it was short-lived. The acting is just as strong as it was in the previous show, despite a few tweaks here and there. David Matranga is still carrying the series, and Luci Christian is still sweet and supportive. She gets more opportunities at range, but said opportunities are limited\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 She alters her approach hilariously when Nagisa gets drunk, and her vocal work during childbirth(Yeah, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be spoiling that here) are heartbreaking.\n\nShe plays her won child, which would be a great opportunity to show more of her abilities, if her child wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as bland and artificial as pepperoni pizza. Illich Gaurdiola returns as Yusuke Yoshino, who is now Tomoya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sempai at work, and while I enjoy him during his weirder moments\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Take the glorious baseball game for example\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The rest of his performance just sounds like one-note mumbling. The pitch sounds right for the sort of character he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s playing, but he sounds like he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be in the booth, and is just getting his lines out as quickly as possible so he can go home. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mention this in the last season\u00e2\u0080\u0099s review(although it applies there too), but Andrew Love and Kara Greenburg are the undisputed stars of the dub as Nagisa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parents, Akio and Sanae. Both characters are almost bipolar in nature, showing vastly different attitudes whether they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re acting calm and quiet or crazy and over-the-top, but either way, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a joy to listen to. It probably helps that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re playing the best characters in the show.\n\nNow, I should probably begin by saying that yes, Clannad Afterstory is better than Clannad, to the point where I wish they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d reversed the names and called the first one Clannad: Beforestory. Because let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s be honest, the first season didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have much of a story\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It featured a collection of small stories that were as interchangeable as the girls Tomoya was helping. The whole thing climaxed with a love confession, and while that may have been believable when you consider Tomoya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self-worth issues, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put up much of an argument for compelling stakes. Afterstory, on the other hand, drops the disjointed nature of the series and decides instead to buckle down and tell a solid, extensive story\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Nine episodes in. Yeah, apparently there were still a few mini-arcs to get through, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be honest, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a chore.\n\nThe first episode, which revolves around the entire cast being reunited for a baseball game, is awesome, even if the plot may have been lifted from Haruhi Suzumiya. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some great comedy in this episode, and it does an admirable job of reintroducing the last season\u00e2\u0080\u0099s characters to the audience, as well as establishing where Tomoya and Nagisa are in their relationship. The next two episodes quickly go downhill as Mei comes back to town to check on Sunohara, and these are some miserable damn episodes. Not only are they stupid and entirely pointless, but they take the somewhat unlikeable Sunohara and turn him into what can only be described as a reprehensibly selfish creature. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll spare you A LOT of the details, but ultimately, Tomoya pretends to be Mei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boyfriend to try to piss Sunohara off. He doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, and later on, he reveals that even though they blatantly claimed to be sleeping together, he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try to stop it \u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause it was you, Okazaki!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yeah, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re gonna trust a pedophile with your 12 year old sister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s virginity, it had better be Okazaki.\n\nThe following arc isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as bad, per se, but equally pointless, and deeply unintentionally funny. The woman who runs the dorm\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Whom in any other show would be too unimportant to have a story arc, but this is Clannad and filler is it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s art form\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And how a boy she fell in love with turned out to be a ghost, but she made a wish to turn him into her immortal pet cat. Yeah, just imagine the implications as she cleans out her one true love\u00e2\u0080\u0099s litter box. Then we get an arc for the quiet girl in the library who occasionally helps them with their problems, and while it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably the best of the three arcs, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still entirely lacking in purpose. As I said before, you could easily skip all of these episodes without losing anything in translation\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But whether you watch it or not, that won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change the fact that immediately afterwards, something amazing happens\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Clannad finally begins to feel like a real story.\n\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re counting the first season, plus OVAs, this is around episode 34, and the main character finally begins to develop. You heard me right. No longer does he just exist to surround himself with broken people, help fix them and occasionally give us something to feel sorry for him about, oh no\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 He grows, faces some real flaws, and learns some actual lessons. He moves out and into his own apartment, supports Nagisa while she repeats her final year of school, and gets a job, actually having to learn his new trade from the ground up. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s living with Nagisa all the while, pops the question to her, and goes through one of my favorite episodes as he tries to get her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s permission to make the engagement official. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not perfect, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clearly the best kind of writing the series has to offer. Which is a shame, because it all comes crashing down due to her pregnancy.\n\nWell, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back it up a bit. Tomoya would be a great character in an anime where the rest of the characters were even close to having as much depth as him. The way it is, with Tomoya having this tragic past, all of this emotional damage, and an entire cast of other characters hanging on his every word constantly reminding him(and us) how great he is, he honestly just feels Mary-Suish on an almost masturbatory level. He gets an idealized wife, because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s left of Nagisa after her play is over, leaving her as a straight up anti-character. Their marriage feels like a couple of kids playing house, which might be because they sleep in different beds and NEVER KISS. The moment when she announces her pregnancy(in the most infantile way possible) is probably the most shocking moment in the whole series. She gives birth, and their daughter is the perfectly idealized well-behaved child who will stay home alone and not get any trouble while her sole caregiver goes through a full-time workday. I mean, sure, she goes for walks on her own, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never addressed as a horribly irresponsible thing for Tomoya to allow.\n\nAnd speaking of Ushio, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s get to the one spoiler I have to talk about(It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the only one, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll avoid the others); Nagisa dies during childbirth, an act I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pretty sure she was written purely for. When this happens, Tomoya spirals into depression, and hands his daughter off to her grandparents\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Which we learn after a five year time skip. This is where my appreciation of Tomoya as a character comes crashing down like a plane with a teddy bear on it. Yes, I know it hurts to lose someone, but wallowing in self pity for five years? I once saw a movie where Kevin James failed to file some important financial paperwork for a year after his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death, and I called bullshit on that, too. If you have children, you have a responsibility to those children, and if you fail to even attempt to live up to that responsibility, I have no sympathy for you.\n\nWhich would be fine, if he were portrayed in an unsympathetic light from then on. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind horrible people in a story, as long as they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re recognized as being horrible. But the very idea that after five years, Akio never once stormed into Tomoya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apartment to kick the crap out of his selfish ass is completely out of character for him. Even his daughter, after a bonding trip that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full of more coincidences than the movie Rat Race, has no problem moving from her big house over the bakery into a smaller apartment to be with her stranger-daddy, even after undoubtedly forming parental bonds with her doting grandparents. Everyone treats poor Tomoya with an \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, you must have had it tough\u00e2\u0080\u009d slap on the back when he deserved a kick in the nuts, which destroyed his very real chances of earning my sympathy.\n\nSo what does this all lead up to? Well, harkening back to my last review, that depends. To half the viewers, it leads to one of the most heartbreaking and then uplifting tragedies of the anime medium. To the other half, it leads to emotionally manipulative tripe that barely deserves to lick their feet. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really speak to which of these opinions is right\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Oh wait, yes I can, because this is my review. The ending of Afterstory is terrible. We get a second tragedy, which I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spoil, and while it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perfectly set up by the internal logic of the series, the punch is soon pulled by a sudden happy ending that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so cheap, even people who explicitly understand the dream world logic call bullshit on it. Not only does it directly undermine the much-adored dark, tragic tones that everyone likes to sell it on, but it backtracks on some of the most important development that Tomoya went through in a way that can easily be compared to the Prince of Persia movie. Yeah, try washing THAT analogy out of your mouth.\n\nClannad Afterstory is available from Sentai Filmworks. Much like the first season, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s available in both DVD and Bluray formats, for between the prices of forty-five and sixty dollars. Each season comes with OVA episodes, and there are three of them in this one\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 A story that allegedly takes place right before the beginning of season 1, and two episodes dedicated to the Kyou and Ryou story arc. There are also undubbed DVDs that are somewhat cheaper. Several manga and live action spin-offs have been created, but none of them are officially available in the States, although there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a petition to translate and import the first visual novel.\n\nEarlier, I said that Afterstory was better than the original Clannad, a statement I still stand by. What I probably should have specified is that better does not equal good, and in this case, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more a drop in the bucket than a noticeable mark in quality. Really, it was only able to pull itself above it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s predecessor by dropping the harem elements and developing it;s main character, both of which it did way too late, and not very well. A good rule of thumb to keep in mind while writing a tragedy is that you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make the audience like a character just by having bad things happen to them. Rather, write them to be interesting beforehand, so that we get to like them before those things happen. The only character we get to know on an intimate level is Tomoya, and we get to know everybody else through their relationships to him\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Thus, when somebody dies, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel as though WE\u00e2\u0080\u0099VE lost someone important, but instead we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expected to feel it through him. Nobody else gets a lover, or an interesting job, or anything else in the future, just Tomoya, and while he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good character by Clannad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s low standards, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just not good enough to get THAT invested in. I give Clannad Afterstory a 4/10.  "}, {"id": 3191, "score": 0, "body": "\n*Contains some spoilers\n\nVery few mythical creatures have dominated our imaginations the way dragons have. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve existed in our culture farther back than vampires, werewolves, and zombies combined. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re practically an ancient idea at this point, having been an important element of both western and eastern folklore, and while there may be significant differences\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 One side of the pond sees them as four legged, giant beasts guarding hordes of gold and battling silver-clad knights over the rights to their most recently stolen princess, while the other side sees them as more serpent-like with sweet facial hair\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The general idea has always been that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re giant scaly beasts who may or may not be able to breathe fire. But what if our folk lore is wrong? What if dragons look nothing like what popular fiction such as Skyrim, fantasy novels and Disney have told us? What if that festive five man dragon costume you saw in that Chinese festival was based on lies? What if dragons are real, and looked nothing like what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been told?\n\nTrue dragons\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The ones that really exist in our world\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Actually look like starfish after several generations of sucking down experimental radiation, to the point that they look more like Star Trek spaceships than bottom-dwelling sea creatures. Their purpose may be unclear, but their children, however, are a bit easier to understand. While they look like Patrick Star has sex with a bunch of different Kirby villains and aborted each resulting baby, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a much more common presence than their giant parents. They like to pair themselves with troubled human youths for unclear purposes and to unclear ends, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one thing that is clear\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Whether you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a cheerful Daddy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s girl, a terminally depressed beauty queen, a bullied genius, a sociopathic misanthrope or an emotionally stunted playboy, having one of these \u00e2\u0080\u0098Dragon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s children\u00e2\u0080\u0099 attach themselves to you is more of a curse than a blessing, and your life is about to get a lot more complicated.\n\nShadow Star Narutaru was produced by Planet, an animation studio with so few credits to their name that wikipedia doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even have a page for them. Anime News Network does, however, which is how I was able to find out that the biggest credit to their name is The Galaxy Railways, and the worst credit to their name\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 According to people I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve spoken to\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Is Moe-Tan, which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard nothing but glowering reviews for. They also did an obscure children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Panda show and the lesser of the two Mermaid Forest adaptations. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d call a promising resume, but leaving all that behind, how does Narutaru look? Like ass. It looks like ass. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard people call it \u00e2\u0080\u0098passable,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 which may have been true in the eighties, but this is a 2003 release, and the animation just barely more competent than 1960\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Spiderman. They do their best to cover for this with their editing and framing work, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a futile effort at best.\n\nWhen a character is moving, the minimum amount of movement is used. If they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re moving their arm, then that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only part that moves. If their movement is finished, their faces freeze in whatever expression they were using at the time. Items moving across the screen like dragon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s children and airplanes move about as naturally as if someone was clicking on them and dragging them from one point to another. There are far too many close-ups during action scenes to keep up with what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on, and whenever the series amps up it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s violence, the visual direction seems less interested in making the show look good and more concerned with being as safe for a wide TV broadcast as it possibly can be through any means necessary. Hell, when a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being forced to drink a glass filled with water and worms(it happens), we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not even allowed to see the worms in the glass. We see her drink it, then later she pukes(offscreen, of course,) and we finally get to see the worms wriggling on a pile of puke that looks exactly like plain old water. Considering how dark and disturbing this show gets, the fact that they were able to edit and frame everything safely enough to air on a channel called \u00e2\u0080\u009cKids Station\u00e2\u0080\u009d is perhaps the most fucked up thing about it.\n\nThe music\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Honestly? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty good. The sound design in general is very impressive, as sounds that would be commonplace in the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suburban setting are used in just the right ways to add tension and suspense to the story. The soundtrack is perhaps the best thing about the series, as it blends the menial tone of children living their day-to-day lives with the far harsher tone of supernatural horror even better than Higurashi ever did. The ending theme is somewhat generic, but what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to draw specific attention to is the opening, Nichiyoubi No Taiyou by The Neutral. The song itself is upbeat and catchy with an addictive vocal style, the kind of song I could easily find myself listening to standalone, regardless of whether or not I understood the lyrics. The video that accompanies it is another highlight of how well the music combines it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s genres, with pretty much the entire video being dominated by childish crayon drawings that simplify and sometimes even straight up misrepresent not only some of the more horrific events in the story, but the implications made by it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s premise. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pretty great soundtrack, to say the least.\n\nAs for the English dub, it could easily pass for an alternative method of prisoner of war torture. That may be a bit hyperbolic, I admit, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very little defense you can make for this dubbing effort. Yeah, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of expected coming from Central Park Media, a dubbing company who uses the critically reviled MD Geist as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proud mascot. But even they can be said to have outdone themselves on this project, which features about 90 percent no-name talent. I never thought I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say this about ANY dub, but has anyone shared with you that Youtube video called \u00e2\u0080\u009cTHE GREATEST GREATEST GREATEST ANIME DUB EVER? The one that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full of relatively safe clips taken from a hentai called Sextra Credit? The acting in Narutaru is about on par with THAT. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s NOT hyperbole. The main actor Kelly Ray has been in a handful of low-rent early 2000\u00e2\u0080\u0099s titles, most notably Alien Nine, and while she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more or less listenable when she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speaking in a low register, whenever she raises her voice for any reason, it becomes the most ear-stabbingly ugly vocal performance I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever heard.\n\nAbout seven of the confirmed cast members have only ever appeared in this particular title, which is either a testament to how few actors had any interest in the material, or some pretty suggestive circumstantial evidence that a lot of the bigger names used aliases in order to keep the series off of their resumes. These one-miss-wonders aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t limited to just side characters, either\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The second biggest character in the series, Akira Sakura, is a ridiculously introverted girl who hates herself and shakes more than Plue from Rave Master.  She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s played by one time actress Renee Gloger, and while I can say this pretty much across the board, one time was enough. At least two of the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s villains, Akinori and Sudo, are supposed to be played as dangerous sociopaths, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re played with all the charisma and personality of a bread sandwich. They each spout their own brand of nihilistic babbling which, without the bulk of the manga\u00e2\u0080\u0099s material to back them up, just comes off as pretentious slosh. The other main character, Hiroko, is played by Flora Stanburg, who mumbles most of her lines and seems to have left the proper emotions at the door outside the booth.\n\nContinuing the trend of fuck-ups I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never encountered before, there are several moments where the dialogue between two characters just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t add up\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Like one was blissfully unaware of the fact that the other was going to adlib. I can think of three or four examples off the top of my head, but the one that jumps most clearly to mind is when Shiina enters Akira\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house for the first time. Akira\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father asks her if she knows his daughter, and Shiina responds by saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cI haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just met her, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my friend!\u00e2\u0080\u009d There are other examples, but let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s instead look at a possible positive. At one point, the dub managed to get it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands on two of the voice acting giants of the late nineties and early aughts\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Veronica Taylor, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better known as Ash Ketchum, and Lisa Ortiz, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best known as Lina Inverse. They were among the best of their time, they put on genuinely good performances, and with their talents, they actually manage to make the formerly terrible dub\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Worse.\n\nLet me explain. While they may have done a few uncredited stock roles, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a decent chance Lisa Ortiz plays two roles, one of which is under the pseudonym Renee Goldstein, they only feature in credited roles for ONE EPISODE. Episode ten. Instead of lifting the over-all dub to a better place, it makes it even more painful when you realize that Central Park Media had access to these celebrated actors, but only used them for one episode, giving their main roles to people who are to acting what virgins are to sex. They COULD have had Lisa Ortiz play Shiina while Veronica Taylor played Akira, and the over-all product would have been so, so much easier to sit through. For an entirely accurate comparison, imagine you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gone to hell and are doomed to eat nothing but dog shit for the rest of your life. you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d eventually get used to your new culinary situation, right? Now imagine that after about fifty years, they start giving you chicken parmesan. A week later, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back to dog shit, only now it tastes just as bad as it did at the start, because you now know what you COULD have been eating all along. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what Taylor and Ortiz do to this dub. I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen this show in Japanese, but do yourself a favor and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go anywhere near the dub.\n\nSo\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 This is going to be a different kind of review. I was nice about the sound and music, because I do believe they were both nice, but aside from the sound design, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t foresee myself having anything nice to say about this title. For this reason, and also because I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to accidentily lead someone to watch the series by telling them it exists, this is not a title that I ever wanted to return to. But in order to grow as a reviewer, I have to talk about the best and the worst that anime has to offer\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Even if that means turning around and standing face to face with an anime that traumatized me from watching anime for the entire month following my completion of it. I will have a lot to talk about with this title, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be spoilers from here on out. I would normally never try to spoil your viewing experience of any anime by telling you how it ends, but most of the important talking points with this anime are spoilers, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also okay because I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want you to watch this title anyway, so a spoiler here and there can only serve my purposes in the long run.\n\nFor starters, one of the worst things an anime can do, in my opinion, is to have a \u00e2\u0080\u0098read the manga\u00e2\u0080\u0099 type ending. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand any anime that forgoes the basic convention of having a conclusion in order to force you to migrate over to the written format just to find out what happens. There are very few anime I ever forgive for this, Berserk being one of the rare exceptions, but it is generally a very fast way to earn my ire. Well, Shadow Star Narutaru might as well be called \u00e2\u0080\u0098Read the Manga; the Anime.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 A twelve volume manga was compressed into a 13 episode series, and to say it shows would be putting it nicely. The first story arc takes place between episodes 1-9, and it focuses on the two main characters obtaining their Dragon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Children, exploring their nature, and facing off against enemies around their age who have their own Draconic companions, one of which is an angelic looking being who goes unnamed in the anime\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Although in the manga, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s named Vagina Dentata. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not kidding. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re welcome for that.\n\nAnyway, they battle the first member of this gang, and he dies at the hands of Shiina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dragon Hoshimaru, upon which the other villains come to town looking for him\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And also looking for Akira, to get her to join them. I think. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure if anyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motivation is made clear. They fight out in a field, as the Japanese military gets involved, and while the multi-episode scuffle is probably the best material in the story, they all go their separate ways once the military is defeated. Then we have an episode where the main villain takes Shiina and Akira fishing, spouts some more nihilistic BS relating fishing to the manipulation of people, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some relationship stuff that goes nowhere, and then\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re gone. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it for them. The villains are written out of the series even more abruptly than they appeared in it, leaving a ton of questions unanswered. Who were they? What drove them to take such actions? Why was one of them naked? Why do Dragon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s children only pair up with preteens? What would happen if they found out their friend was dead? The storyline is dropped cold, and from what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard from people who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve read the manga, this arc could have been told much more coherently if it had all 13 episodes to itself, but no, it just gets cut off and dropped unceremoniously so we can jump to the next story arc, which lasts only one episode and features a twist conclusion that even M Knight Shyamalan would find laughable.\n\nNow, up until this point, this anime has been really, really bad. The writing has been choppy, character motivations are still up in the air, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a constant assault on our eyes and ears, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re no closer to knowing anything about the Dragon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Children and why they\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Literally anything. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not unwatchable. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not repulsive. Not yet. You can still get engaged with all the intrigue and mysterious characters, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not hard to turn off your brain and enjoy the action scenes. But then something happens that takes what should have been yet another awful anime and turns it into something special. Something I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had difficulty talking about publicly until a few weeks ago. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like if you were feeling excited that you were about to watch a brand new episode of My Little Pony; Friendship is magic, only to see the episode title come up and read as \u00e2\u0080\u009cCupcakes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yeah, you can tell yourself that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a coincidence, and that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably just going to be an innocent episode, but a part of you knows that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken their mining of the Brony community for ideas a little too far, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re about to do something so Grimdark that they never should have even considered it. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about THAT kind of bad.\n\nIn the final story arc, one of Shiina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friends is going through a tough dilemma. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being bullied by four girls in her class who want her to lower her grades\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The reason is never mentioned, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just going to fill in the blanks and say they want to lower the class average so they can look better without having to do any extra studying\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And the whole worm thing happens. Her grades drop to a 97, and her father starts bullying her about not hanging out with Shiina anymore. But the peak of the whole damn series comes when the four girls corner her, pin her down, and rape her with a test tube. Please read that sentence a few times, because it needs to be emphasized, and I only feel like saying it once. A boy shows up to interrupt them, so they leave, and since the foreign object is hollow and made of glass, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to give this boy some credit for helping the girl to not become One Guy One Jar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s big sister. She goes home and catches her father burning her bridges with Shiina, and the straws break the camel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back. Turns out she has a Dragon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Child that kills her parents and brutally murders three of the girls, just barely sparing the only repentant one and, by the way, raping the ring leader to death.\n\nNow, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talk about child psychology for a bit. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never studied it, but according to the people I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve spoken to who had any knowledge whatsoever to offer, 11 year old girls do not rape each other. I know, big shock, right? Even the few people who called it plausible did so by comparing rape to confirmed cases of murder and slut shaming\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 NOT THE SAME AS RAPE. Kids can do some nasty things, but the idea of them sexually torturing each other\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Especially when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s four like-minded girls going after another\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incredibly freaking unlikely. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s far more likely is that the person writing of this scenario is a repressed pedophile with an imagination sadistic enough that not even Freddy Krueger would touch his dreams. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve looked into some of the manga that Mohiro Kitoh has written, and I can say with some confidence that he hates children even more than the creator of Bioshock must have. At least three of them heavily feature children in adult situations and a bunch of horrific deaths. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not hard to watch that final story arc and think that the whole test tube scene was concocted just so the artist could justify tearing apart four middle school aged girls with a self-insert demon monster.\n\nAnd as I alluded before, the people adapting this lovely manga did the best they could to keep the horrific, deplorable acts just off screen and out of frame, but still making damn sure the audience knows what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on, so they could honor the artist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vision without having to sacrifice a younger audience. Christ, even if it was deemed safe enough to air on \u00e2\u0080\u009cKids Station,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the final three episodes of this show are pure nightmare fuel. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m thirty, and even I had bad dreams after watching it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Both times! How sleazy can you get? Never mind how this must have effected die-hard fans of the manga, who probably WANTED to see the sick, bloody content materialized on screen. It was probably for their sake that the first story arc was rushed and cut off so abruptly, with entire scenes and arcs from the manga cut out. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get me wrong, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t WANT to see an eleven year old girl get force-fed worms and raped with a monster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talon while her half-decapitated brother/lover lies behind the bed, until finally she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s torn apart from the inside, I would NEVER want to see that, but if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to show it on screen, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the point of having it happen at all? People who came for the shocking content are going to be disappointed either way, so focus instead on the impressionable little minds tuning into Kids\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Station!  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re clearly not comfortable with your own material, so find a new ending(might as well at this point).\n\nShadow Star Narutaru was available stateside from Central Park Media, but has yet to be rescued, and is currently out of print. The DVDs are available relatively cheaply online, or you can buy the four disks together as a set. The original manga is available stateside from Dark Horse, and while I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d normally be apprehensive to recommend something that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been heavily censored, it was probably for the best with this series. The story is apparently a lot longer and more complete, although there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allegedly a lot more rape in it. Enter at your own risk.\n\nWhen I got into reviewing anime, I figured I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have people knocking down my door with requests. And I wanted it to happen. Requests keep you on your toes, so you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to choose every single anime you review for yourself. If I had a lot of requests, then I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have exhausted my personal reserves to the point that Shadow Star Naturaru would become a viable option for the November lineup. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve received a grand total of five requests in the past three years, and four of them were from people I know in real life. If I had more requests, then I might never have had any reason to go back into the trenches to rewatch this piece of shit. But since it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s number DID come up, I might as well say that Shadow Star Narutaru is the worst anime I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen. The story is badly executed and incomplete, the plot and premise are nonsensical, there are several questions unanswered and loose ends untied, and even when it does manage to tell a complete story arc from beginning to end(or close to it), the material is deplorably tasteless. It sounds nice as long as nobody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talking, but it still looks like ass from every angle. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, in good conscience, recommend this to anyone. I give Shadow Star Narutaru a -10/10.\n\nBut, since that's not possible here, let's go for a 0 instead."}, {"id": 3193, "score": 40, "body": "Once upon a time, there was a middle schooler named Misaki. He was a beloved student, as smart as he was affable, and he had the unanimous favor of both his student body and the teaching staff. He died tragically in a house fire that took not only his life, but that of his parents and siblings, too. Distraught by this loss, his entire class adopted a ritual of pretending that he was still in the room with them. They left his desk empty, gave him handouts, and even arranged for his posthumous graduation. But little did they know that by refusing to acknowledge their classmate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s untimely demise, they were creating an opportunity for HIM to ignore his fate as well.\n\nEvery year following this event, Misaki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ghost stayed in that classroom as a student\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But his lingering spirit brought a tragic curse upon the residents of class 3. If the number of seats in the classroom matched the number of students, then Misaki would have nowhere to sit, and thus, a string of tragic deaths would occur among the people who were connected to that class\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Both students, teachers and their relatives alike. The only way to stop this curse was to alienate one student, pretending they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist so that Misaki wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel left out\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And if they could hold this ritual down for one month, the deaths would not occur for the rest of the year. Everything was going fine until one year, one transfer student was absent from the first day of school, and wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t able to hear about these rules, and unfortunately for him, the first and second rule of Death Class is \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo not talk about Death Class.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Will his curious questions draw the class closer and closer to their assured doom, or can they find some way to stop it in time to survive the school year and put it all behind them?\n\nWith Another, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re once again returning to the realm of PA Works, a company that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s produced many impressive looking, high budget shows over the years. Another doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to have that budget advantage, however, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very staticky, text-heavy show all around. About seventy five percent of the time, movement on screen is minimal, using fixed camera angles and talking heads for what should have been embarrassing lengths of time. The other twenty five percent of the time, the animation will show off a dramatic increase of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s frame rate in order to carry the more action heavy moments, especially with it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bevy of gruesome death scenes. For such a wide clash in animation style, the difference is surprisingly hard to notice, as the aesthetic of the series remains consistent throughout. Chances are, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be too distracted by the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gorgeous visual direction to notice just how inexpensive the animation really is, which is what ultimately saves it from looking like a cheap show.\n\nAnother adopts a dark, gothic aesthetic, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pulled off very well. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the most evident in one character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house, which is dimly lit and full of creepy looking ball joint dolls, but that one setting is small potatoes compared to the over-all atmosphere of the series which is gloomy, foreboding and full of realistic gritty details. The character designs as well are grounded and simple, covering all the essential tropes while still never being over-the-top enough to distract from the heavy, somber mood. Even the beach episode, while full of contextual fan service, never manages to betray the feeling of imminent danger surrounding the characters at all times.\n\nThe music is also very true to this mood. Kow Otani is a legend, famous for his work on the Godzilla films and, more relevant to Another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tone, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also highly celebrated for creating the soundtrack to the video game Shadow of the Colossus. The music matches perfectly with every beat of the story, showing off it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blend of cute high school melodrama and harsh, heart-pounding horror to a frightening degree. The perfect example of this is the track \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Story of Yomiyama,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which inserts intense dramatic stings into a soothing yet still really creepy piano tune, and the two intermingle more and more throughout the track, sounding downright sinister by the one minute mark, and it creates the image of people running for their lives away from a terrifying monster who wants them for dinner and won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take no for an answer. You won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find this kind of feeling from all of the music tracks heard throughout the series, but the feelings they do express are flawless across the board. There are few things lonelier than Mei Misaki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character theme, and the opening theme, Kyoumu Densen by Ali Project, is a nigh-unskippable fast-paced goth rock piece, with vocals that match hauntingly well with the orchestration.\n\nWhen I heard that the dub for this show was being both written and directed by the same person, I was initially worried that it might have gone to Steven Foster, the notorious ruiner of material, butcher of teen dialogue, and possible space alien learning human speech patterns piece by piece to further his conquest of the planet. Thankfully, the dub went instead to Chris Ayres. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not familiar with his behind-camera work, but if Another is any indication of his abilities, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m looking forward to seeing more from him. Overall, the performances in this dub are very grounded and naturalistic, with no real standouts to speak of\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Although in a dub like this one, uniformity is a good thing.\n\nThere are a few performances of note, though. Monica Rial, who plays the character Mei Misaki, the student who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been chosen to be ignored by the class, brings a sense of bitterness to the character that was sorely lacking in the Japanese, as well as a condescending air when talking to odd man out Koichi. Jessica Boone plays a pig-tailed tsundere girl named Izumi, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been tasked with the title of Head of Countermeasures, which is a creative spin on the class rep title that a character like her would typically get. She gives the character strength, as well as a patience that has very clear limits. Blake Shepherd, who I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve bashed in the past, is used surprisingly well as the soft voiced Yuya.\n\nThe actors are directed extremely well by Ayres, who knows exactly when to get subtlety from them, and when to unleash the reigns and let them scream in blood curdling terror. Every single voice crack is on point, every scream is terrifying, and the noises the unlucky students make as they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re dying are skin-crawlingly realistic. His interpretation of the script is faithful to the original, while still altering the wordings and turn of phrase just enough to be accessible to an English speaking audience without even once betraying the intention of any of it.\n\nI first watched Another way back in the fall of 2013, after being intrigued to pick it up by the smattering of clips that it inspired in both versions of AMV Hell 6. The basic plot and several death scenes were already spoiled for me beforehand through word-of-mouth and the aforementioned AMV Hell clips, but I was still finding myself mildly entertained by the material. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t great, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t giving me feels, but I was enjoying the dark tone and trying to figure out the mystery. But then the ending happened\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The ending that people like to laud as being one of the greatest they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen. Even people who didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like the show still claim the final two episodes made the entire experience worth it for them.\n\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some pretty heavy praise, which is why I was all the more disappointed by my own reaction to it. If nothing else, I can safely admit that the ending of Another affected me in a way that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think any other Anime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ending has affected me before\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It actually made me feel uncomfortable. Honestly, throughout those two episodes, there were times where I felt sick to my stomach, and I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sure why. It couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be the violence\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Oh no, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen and loved shows far more bloody than this, so what was it? In the two years that have followed since then, and especially after watching it a second time for the sake of this review, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pretty sure I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve finally pinned down what it was that kept me from enjoying this bloody, bloody spectacle.\n\nBefore I get into that, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talk about the characters. The two leads are Koichi, the boy who missed the rules, and Misaki, the excluded girl. I hated them both, and they were the only two characters in the show that I actively wanted to see get killed. Koichi, the boy we spend the majority of the series with, is one of those boring and bland main characters who exists as a blank slate for the viewer to project themselves onto, so that you can explore the story right alongside with them. Honestly, the only thing I can remember about him is that his father lives in India. His role in the story is to ask a lot of questions and make situations worse, so he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basically Mindy from Animaniacs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIgnore that girl, she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy? Why? Why? Why?\u00e2\u0080\u009d And I get that, because nobody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allowed to tell him, and being left out of something sucks, but for God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake, have an arc! Get a hobby!\n\nMisaki is where the series gets it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s iconic look, contrived though it may be. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the eyepatch girl, which is a tried and true trope, and she is owned entirely by her darker color palette. She speaks in stilted, overly formal slow speech and seems to have a serious phobia of contractions. As far as her speech goes, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basically a poor man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Rei Ayanami, right down to the fact that she literally lives in a house full of dolls that she probably adopted her personality from. She even has a doll\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye in place of her missing eye. I kind of like characters like that, so I really wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind her so much if the series wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t such a troll about how they used her. Her darker edges, while somewhat iconic, have absolutely nothing to do with the plot or story of the series, so she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seriously like that just for flavor, and nothing else.\n\nAnd then there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the ghost\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yes, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m considering him a character, deal with it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s level of power and influence is just plain laughable. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s omnipotent, can monitor and kill you at any time, in any way, and for any reason as long as you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re within the city limits, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still not sure what his motives are. I just started picturing him as some stereotypical Looney Toons style mob boss, flipping a quarter while chewing a toothpick and daring anybody who he can control to oppose him or his best friend Murphy. He has the Yuki Nagato-level ability to alter not only peoples\u00e2\u0080\u0099 memories, but public records as well, which begs the question of why he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just force people to think he exists, which he totally could. But then again, for someone with so much power, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s somehow unable to notice a student leaving a tape full of clues behind in the classroom for years.\n\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only one character I did like, who I actually wanted to see survive\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 A strong, selfless character with convictions that I really admired, and whom I wanted to learn more about\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll let you find out for yourselves whether or not they lived, but aside from those four, there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much of a cast to speak of. The class is made up of walking character designs, some more likeable than others, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all more or less dispensable, so let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talk about what kind of story Another is.\n\nIn the strictest literary terms, Another is a tragedy. You might not think that at first, since it shares the same basic idea as the Final Destination films, which were definitely horror comedies, but it is. Another wants you to take it super-seriously, despite how ridiculous and goofy it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s many death scenes are. To it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s credit, Another is a master of tone, and it places it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s horror exactly where it belongs; on the faces of its surviving characters. Their sense of edginess and unease are only ever interrupted by their terrified reactions to the gruesome demises around them, which goes a long way in making up for the lunacy of watching a girl fall down the stairs and land throat-first onto the pointy end of her umbrella. Yes, Another is very firmly a tragedy, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of the problem.\n\nI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make this observation myself\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I learned it from the work of another reviewer, who also learned it from someone else\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But in order for a tragedy to truly work, it has to be earned. A tragic ending can only be earned when it feels inevitable, as if the characters it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening to have done everything in their power to prevent it, but were unable to because of one damning flaw in either themselves or their world that made their efforts futile. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basically like going to a casino, making millions of dollars at Black Jack, and then losing it all because you just couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t handle not doing one more hand. In Another, I just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel that at all.\n\nFor starters, in order to take this story seriously, you would first have to believe that a school with a yearly student body count wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be closed down and subsequently demolished to make way for a new building. Would this work? Maybe, maybe not, but the idea of people still sending their kids to a school like that and them willingly going there just infuriates me. But what makes me even more angry is the supernatural power that Mei Misaki possesses, and how easily it could have ended the calamity on multiple occasions\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But she refuses to use it in the early episodes because she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to get made fun of, and she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put it to good use until the last ten minutes of the final episode for spoiler reasons that are complete BS. She could have saved eight peoples\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lives just by speaking up at the right time. She killed them by not speaking up, and the narrative makes no attempt to even acknowledge it. The only thing that was inevitable about this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tragic ending is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to try and be vague about this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 That the ghost trolled everybody by breaking it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own rules.\n\nI know I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been talking a lot about the ending, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where the majority of my serious problems with this series lie, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult to talk about why it made me feel so turned off without giving away some spoilers. Instead of saying more about what it did wrong, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to tell you the two things I wish it had done right, both of which could have secured a much higher rating from me.\n\nThe perfect ending to this series, for me at least, would have seen the entire class\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Plus their vulnerable family members\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Forming a united front and charging the school at night with intent to burn it down. The school would have defended itself through it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Murphy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law magic, and a lot of them would have died, but the ones who survived would have succeeded in their task, rendering the school unusable and ending the curse forever. The somewhat less perfect ending would have seen a handful of characters confronting the extra classmate, getting them to remember that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re dead, and speaking to the class\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ghost through them, reasoning with him, learning about him, and ultimately convincing him to move on to the spirit world, ending the curse forever ala Paranorman.\n\nIf you hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t noticed, what with me being so subtle about it, the one thing those two ideas have in common is that, in both cases, the curse is ended permanently. This is important for three reasons; First of all, it gives all the meaningless deaths in the series purpose, as at least it would mean they accomplished in exchange for their sacrifice. Secondly, ending the curse during this particular year would have made said year special compared to every other of the 26 years that the curse had been active, thus justifying that year being the focal point of the series in the first place. And finally, for the simple reason that it would have given the series a much needed sense of closure.\n\nWell, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like the series, but why did it make me feel so sick and uncomfortable? Well, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very specific reason for that, and it has to do with what I believe to be the intention of the series. Another feels, to me, like somebody with pent up rage issues putting a lot of people into one house in The Sims, putting the carpets too close to the fireplace and removing all the doors. It feels like the writer is a lonely person\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Probably in middle school\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Who decided to write a story where he could insert himself as a powerful supernatural being who can strike fear and obedience into the hearts of all his fellow students who make fun of him, ignore him and have social lives that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t involve him. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my biggest problem with Another: Not that it fails in a literary sense, which it does, but because it feels like someones sick revenge fantasy that they published and printed for the world to see. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to see that, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know why anybody else would.\n\nAnother is available from Sentai Filmworks in both DVD and Blu-Ray formats, both of which can currently be found on Amazon for around thirty dollars apiece. You can also find it on Crunchyroll, but they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t currently offer the English Dub. There are two light novels and a manga that are both available stateside from Yen Press, and a live action film that is still unfortunately not. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an OVA episode called Another: The Other, Inga that acts as a prequel to the series. Weird title aside, this is probably the best episode of the entire show, and while it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intended to be watched after the series, I strongly recommend watching it beforehand, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a much better introduction to the power, circumstances, and personal tragedy behind Mei, the posterchild for the series, which helps to clear up any confusion caused by its insistence on using her as a red herring. It can be found on pretty much any release of the series.\n\nAnother is currently considered the greatest horror anime of all time by numerous sources, such as Rightstuf magazine and Watchmojo, but to say that I disagree is a huge understatement. Rather than a dark horror story or a cheesy slasher film, it feels more like watching a PETA documentary on slaughterhouses. Yes, seeing horses on a conveyer belt getting stabbed in the head upsets me, but not because I care about any of them individually\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pissed off at the people behind it for butchering them so heartlessly and mechanically for the sake of human consumption. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give the series high marks for it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beautiful presentation and for holding my interest as long as it did, but what started out as a mildly entertaining ride ended just on a giant trollface that taunted me for daring to take the mystery and the fates of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character designs seriously. I give Another a 4/10.  "}, {"id": 3208, "score": 30, "body": "Can we all just agree that dreams are fucking weird? They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re one of the least understood aspects of human life, and everybody but Mike Pence has them. Their are tons of theories about what their purpose is, what they mean, and why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re always naked in them, but to this day, nobody can pinpoint what these bizarre movies we get to watch while we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re recharging even are. Sometimes they have purpose\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Back when I was in a bad relationship where I felt trapped and with no control over my life, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d constantly dream that I was stuck on a labyrinthian waterslide that I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t escape from. But they can be completely nonsensical, too. Maybe you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re fighting in a war with flamethrowers, but they suddenly turn into waterguns. Maybe you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re running from a spider that can fit through any crack. Maybe you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re beating up pedophiles, taunting serial killers, throwing horses at witches, fighting demons in the wild west, meeting people you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see anymore, running from a golden car like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a metaphor for Satan, or hell, maybe you get into a car crash but wind up in your living room, with your family ominously telling you \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s waiting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor little Nemo, dreams aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite like that. Every single one of his dreams is a lucid one, and he can use them to escape to big fantastical worlds, all by riding on his bed like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a magic carpet. One day, after seeing a parade and wanting desperately to go to the circus, Nemo drifts off and is invited to the world of Slumberland, a country governed by a kind, jovial king and his prickly little daughter, and inhabited by a whole host of wild and zany characters. Nemo is declared the King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heir, and entrusted with protecting it from harm, but it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t long at all before one of these inhabitants, a chain-smoking green minstrel named Flip, tempts him into letting Slumberland get taken over by a terrifying sea of darkness, which leaves it in shambles and takes the King away to a faraway land. With the order of a whole world now at stake, there is only one chance at saving it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Joined by Flip, the princess, a wacky professor and his talking squirrel sidekick, Nemo must brave the horrors of Nightmareland to make everything right again!\n\n\nIf I were to show you Little Nemo directly, there are two reactions I expect from you almost immediately. The first would be disbelief at the fact that Nemo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a clownfish(although his world is populated by Clowns), and incredulity at the fact that it really doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look like an anime. It is, I assure you\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It was produced by Japan and released in Japan three years before it was released in the States, although I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say roughly a quarter of the people credited to making it are American, including both of the screenwriters. The production was a mess of almost legendary proportions, with huge names from both sides of the ocean coming into the project and then leaving it just as quickly, leaving influence behind but rarely ever any guidance on how to implement it. Even Hayao Miyazaki himself was attached at one point, which is probably why the movie opens with a sequence of Nemo flying through the city on his bed. It was ultimately produced by TMS, a company that made Akira and animated several american cartoons.\n\nAnd speaking of American cartoons, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly what this movie was based on. Little Nemo was originally a newspaper comic that ran in the early 1900\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, which doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sound like something an anime would ever be based on, and yet lo and behold, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we have here. Visually, this is exactly what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d think of if I was told that an anime was being designed to look like an American product. First of all, being that this WAS a product of TMS, the animation budget was high, so there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of fluid animation and graceful character movement, sometimes almost to a fault. It is very lively, and it makes the movie feel really energetic, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a certain feeling of over-indulgence to it, like what the Nostalgia Critic might call movement porn. It never stops moving, which can almost feel exhausting at points. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of those cases where something was new at the time, and had never really been attempted to such a degree, so of course it was impressive at the time for what it achieved, but looking back, it could have been done better.\n\nFor example, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a scene where the cast engages in a dance at the palace, and Professor Genius starts doing a weird dance(I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be surprised if The Duke of Wesselton wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t at least partially inspired by this), and then the king joins in, and for this strangely surreal moment, it looks like the two are moving in sync, probably through some sort of rotoscoping, despite being at least a foot apart in height. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a really creepy bit of Uncanny valley. Oh, and speaking of Uncanny valley, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also the facial animations, which I actually kind of had trouble watching. Characters were so far removed from your typical anime style that it honestly looks like something Chuck Jones would have animated while shit-face drunk, and this is reflected in the character designs. Most of the characters look all right, if a bit generic, but the animation doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always work in their favor. Princess Camille, for example? Whenever she lets her shoulders slump, she looks more arrow than human. She looks like the love child of Bob Belcher and Marzipan from the Homestarrunner cartoons. At least the demons look cool, I guess.\n\nWhen it comes to the music, I was actually kind of expecting the American and Japanese releases to have different soundtracks, but surprisingly, they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Even though this movie was originally released in Japan, the OST was comprised of English language songs. On Wikipedia, the music is credited to a few American sounding names, including the Sherman Brothers, who are absolute legends in the field of family film musical scores. The film\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main theme, which is simply named Little Nemo after the Japanese title of the movie, is beautiful. I love it. It works great in the film, carrying the kind of epic whimsy that can only be found in nineties children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movies, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just as strong when listened to on it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own. Melissa Manchester has an amazing voice, which I really shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to tell anyone who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s familiar with her work, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a testament to her strength as an artist that she can carry the Sherman Brothers occasionally awkward and flowery lyrics without ever sounding hokey or condescending.\n\nUnfortunately, this mark of inspiration doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really carry over to the rest of the soundtrack, which sounds about as standard for a generic children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movie soundtrack that you can get, with some of the songs being directly attached to scenes that were clearly added to the film just to pad out the run time. This is no more clear than with the song Etiquette, which I think was supposed to be funny, but just winds up coming off as annoying. Melissa Manchester is nowhere to be found on this track, but she might not have been able to save it anyway, because she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t able to carry her majesty from Little Nemo over to the song Slumberland, which is just kind of boring over-all. Songs like Fun and Laughter, The Boomps Song and Princess of Slumberland are safe, saccharine and forgettable, which is sadly par for the course with this soundtrack. The instrumental tracks are okay, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not the kind of thing that could ever set the world on fire, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing about them that really justifies going out of your way to find them.\n\nThe English dub is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also okay. There are a ton of really popular names credited to this film, including a pre-Simpsons Nancy Cartwright and a post-Vampire Hunter D Michael McConnohie. Actually, there area ton of voice actors attached to this project whose resumes would surprise you, as even beyond famous names like Tress Macneille, Jennifer Darling, Sherry Lynn and the late June Foray, there are names that may have flown under your radar like Ren\u00c3\u00a9 Auberjonois and Gabriel Damon, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sad to say this, almost none of them brought their A-game to this project. There are a few exceptions, like Laura Mooney in the role of the Princess, who was the only cast member who CLEARLY wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trying; Bernard Erhard, who put his heart and soul into making King Morpheus the most likeable guy in the world, and strangely enough Mickey Rooney, who was obviously having a blast playing the mischievous and duplicitous Flip. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a great dub, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s passable enough, which is good, because western releases don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t include a Japanese language sub track.\n\nSo, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an interesting little bit of trivia for you guys: this was the first anime I ever watched. It predates my experiences with Pokemon and Dragonball by nearly a decade, even. When I was little, like really little, my Dad would often rent movies on VHS and bring them home for my brother and me to watch. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d go to the grocery store\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Wegmans, in my area\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Rent some random movie with a G rating and bring it home for us. For those of you who are confused by those last two sentences, ask your parents. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d bring home Disney movies, Don Bluth movies, straight-to-video shitfests(I saw Once Upon a Forest at least three times), and on one occasion, Little Nemo. Now, as a kid, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the greatest attention span, but I always found myself getting absorbed in stories. I watched movies mostly attentively, and shamed people who didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t(To this day, I get really annoyed by people who play on their phones during a movie), and as soon as I learned to read, I could go hours without putting a book or comic down.\n\nThere are some exceptions to this rule, however, and Little Nemo is one of them. My memory\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not great, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pretty sure I only saw it once, and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really pay attention to it. Even only a year later, all I could remember about it was the Princess Camille stuff, because even Little Naru loved him some princesses. I only really wound up thinking about it a few times in the years that followed, like one time when I was reading up on the history of newspaper comics, or when Finding Nemo came out, or when I found out it was an anime, or when The Nostalgia Critic and The Mysterious Mr. Enter did some really good videos on it, \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But I never really started thinking about it seriously until I started reviewing anime, and I knew I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have to hit it again eventually. Well, almost five years in, that time has finally come. I bought the movie online, let it sit on my coffee table for a few months(don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t judge me) and finally, I popped it in and watched it for the first time in over twenty years, and let me tell you, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a reason it bored me as a kid.\n\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot to unpack here, so to stay focused, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to go too far into any of the behind the scenes stuff. Production of this film was famously a nightmare, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apparently one of Hayao Miyazaki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worst professional experiences, it was a huge bomb when it was released, and the production company, TMS, who were riding high after the success of Akira at the time, were so badly damaged by it that they haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been the same since. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t personally know any more about any of this than I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been told, I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly done any research into it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not really the kind of thing I do here\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lack of success isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really a surprise to me, and if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen it yourself, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take a lot of run time to pick up on the fact that it was never going to be anybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favorite film for any reason but childhood nostalgia. The only thing I can really talk about here is my personal experience watching the movie, and if it helps, my thoughts as to why it flopped as hard as it did.\n\nFirst of all, the main character\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The titular Nemo\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Is a special kind of bland. He has no personality to speak of, he has no interests or goals outside of visiting the circus and doing whatever the plot tells him to do, and if I had to guess, his companion, a little sentient flying squirrel with flight goggles on his head, was added to the story to make him more interesting in the new medium(it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work. also, how weird is it that they had June Foray in the cast, the voice of rocky, but she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t play his arguable rip-off?)). He just goes with the flow while spouting off lazy little boy one-liners like Yippee! Gee Whiz! and Wowwee! He doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even immediately grasp that a princess is a girl, a conversation which\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 to be fair\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Was even dumber in the NES game. The worst thing about him isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t how boring or bland he is, however\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how little agency he has in the story. for the bulk of the movie, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just following orders, going along with whatever the other characters want him to do, and when Flip pressures him to go back on some of these orders, he folds like origami.\n\nThe first real choice he makes is to try and undo that mistake\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 about twenty minutes after making it. He gains some agency in the third act, where he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading the charge to the Nightmare castle to rescue everybody, but even then, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to get invested because you never feel that he has any connection to any of it. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only known any of these people for less than a day, the whole world is just shallow eye candy with nothing substantial to offer, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry, but a king who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s willing to hand a key to what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basically the doors of hell to a child he just met fifteen minutes ago was asking for his kingdom to get taken over. In stories like these, the hero has to have a personal reason to save the world he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wandered into, but with Nemo, he just feels like our excuse to explore a bunch of Candyland backgrounds in a barely story-driven animation demo, and the moments of actual story feel either distractingly stupid or gratingly annoying. When Nemo is being tossed around by spastic tutors trying to educate him on proper behavior, I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care if he woke up, got up to use the bathroom, and then went back to bed and dreamed about running from monster tornadoes. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be just as engaged.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest problem is that we KNOW he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just having a dream, and that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no more to it than that. Right in the beginning of the movie, we see most of the characters from Slumberland walking down the street in a parade, which is how he came to dream about them. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not real. None of this is real. This wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be such a big deal if the dream-like aspects were the whole point, and it was just supposed to be a trippy experiences, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a story and plot involved, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost no urgency behind any of it. If he fails, nothing is lost. If he succeeds, nothing is gained. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no interesting subtext, no metaphor to speak of, no commentary, just the classic artwork and imagination of Windsor McKay being shown off in a story that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do any of it justice. I mean, the only thing that does any work moving the plot forward is the character of Flip, but his motivation in the story is so completely bankrupt that he almost feels like the personification of the audience screaming \u00e2\u0080\u009cGet on with it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even manage to be dream-like. Like I said before, dreams are weird. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have plots, they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t contain full stories. Little Nemo is too conventional of a story to even grasp the surrealism that any good dream-based narrative should, at the very least, be able to pull off. Remember in Nichijou, when characters are put in bizarre situations like having to eat noodles off of a shoot before they hit the ground? Or having to buy a snowman off of the shelf before it melts, and they do so with actual sincerity, like they believe these tasks to be important? That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how dreams work. Remember Alice in Wonderland, or the old Nightmare Ned computer game? That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how dreams work. Okay, the Nightmare Ned TV series had consistent stories, but at least they had the benefit of being smart and well written. You wanna show me a dream with a solid narrative? Make a movie where someone has to deal with a cult of people who brainwash each other into mutilating the bone structure of their faces, or getting stuck in a pizza place that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a metaphor for purgatory.\n\nThe actual story is bad enough, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost no creativity to the visuals, and while I get that the whole movie is based on a preexisting work, and they had established content to work with, but that shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have limited them so harshly. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an adaptation, but the concept surrounding it was just ripe for updates. They could have unleashed their imaginations upon the world, using McKay\u00e2\u0080\u0099s imagination as a pretty solid foundation for interpretation, but everything just feels so lazy and uninspired. The Slumberland sets basically went from Candyland to the ocean to a dark and dreary underworld, and a King of nightmares(or something) who just looked like Chernabog on a juice cleanse. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the best you got? Give me a demonic three headed goat or something(can you tell I crowd-sourced some weird dream ideas for this review?)! I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been this disappointed since the villain in Insidious turned out to be Darth Maul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s edge-lord little cousin! There are so many ways this movie could have been great, but sadly, they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take any of them.\n\nLittle Nemo, which has the additional subtitle of Adventures of Slumberland over here, is way out of print, but the Easternstar DVD is still really easy to find online for cheap. The original comic is also easy to find online, but it ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cheap, and the books they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re contained in tend to be gigantic, and can be a pain to display because of it. The entire Little Nemo franchise is in the public domain, so if you want to use it for yourself, you can do so without issue.\n\nWhen I reviewed Spirited Away, I went into detail on my revised feelings towards children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s media, and that a movie doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily have to be critically good for kids to watch it. The only exception is when a movie teaches a bad message or could potentially provide a negative influence, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing like that in Little Nemo, so do I recommend showing it to your kids? I guess so, but I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t honestly see them asking to see it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fairly obscure movie, and if it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t develop a huge cult following after getting put out on DVD early this decade, then I doubt it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll happen anytime soon. If you have fond childhood memories of it and want to show it to your kids for that reason, go ahead, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no guarantee they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll like it. I certainly didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. That aside, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pretty firmly forgotten movie, and while I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love to see someone else take a shot at adapting McKay\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opus\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 come on Disney, this shit has your name all over it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 This is one nostalgic movie you can leave right in your memories where it belongs. I give Little Nemo a 3/10. "}, {"id": 3214, "score": 20, "body": "-Some spoilers.\n\nLike your average high school boy, Ryosuke Kaga can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop thinking perverted thoughts. Unlike the average high school boy, he won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shut up about it, and cares little for anything other than breasts, butts, breasts, napes, breasts, panties, breasts, and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Um\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Underarms. It makes more sense when he says it.  Yes, they may have debunked the theory that men think about sex every seven seconds, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only because nobody studied this kid.\n\nAnyway, on his way home from school, he sees a beautiful red-haired girl standing all alone in the rain outside of his house. Not content to just stare at her wet, transparent shirt, he offers her his umbrella, and invites her in for a change and a shower. No sooner are they indoors and alone then she begins to hold him close\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And just when he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s getting ready to ditch his V-card, she winds up penetrating him\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 through the heart with a giant sword.\n\nAs it turns out, her name is Lisara, and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a grim reaper\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 You know, those things that were cool until Soul Eater\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And in order to complete her mission on earth, she needed to form a contract with somebody who had inexplicably high amounts of life energy. Which Ryosuke apparently has in spades. Once a contract is made, she draws her power directly from the one thing that makes her new partner love his life so much. Unfortunately for her, she finds out that Ryosuke drives his passion from his perversion, so she can only be at full power when he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s popping a woody\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Which works out perfectly, because without that power, she gets her ass kicked faster than Lina Inverse on her period, losing her clothes in the process.\n\nAt first glance, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d think this was the perfect set-up for an ecchi fanservice series\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, yes and no. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to the meat of this review in a few paragraphs, but for the moment, I must give credit where credit is due.\n\nSo I Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Play H\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll simply be calling H from now on\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Was produced by a company called feel, and while I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love to say some smart-sounding words about their track record and production history, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never actually heard of this company before. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done in-between animation on a few shows I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen, but up until now, the only show they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve directly produced and animated that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve actually seen was Corpse Princess\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Which I only remember dropping out of boredom.\n\nI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say anything about feel, but whatever their eternally lower-cased history may be, this show is drop dead gorgeous. The occasional CG is breathtaking, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taking the form of a simple escalator or the teleportation field around a reaper. This is CG rendering that even Sword Art Online would be gasping at, even if the color scheme does kind of become an eyesore in the final few episodes. The backgrounds are exquisitely detailed, expertly framed, and they will absolutely dazzle you with their use of lighting and shading.\n\nThe animation for the characters is much simpler, but not bad by any means\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Their designs are very standard, a little on the bland side, and nowhere near as realistic as the aesthetic would have you believe, but their movement is still quite a bit more fluid than what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d find in most shows of a similar ilk. Key frames and speedlines are rare, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re used fairly well for what they are.\n\nSo, when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about ecchi titles, the bar is consistently a low one\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Titty showcases aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t typically known for having good writing, original ideas, or any value outside of the perverse. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entirely possible for ecchi shows to be enjoyable outside of the skin content that they offer\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Strike Witches is a prime example of this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But actual depth and creativity are rare elements indeed. So why am I bringing this up, while talking about a show that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basically just Bleach meets Girls Bravo, with an older version of Shana in the lead role? Because, believe it or not, So I Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Play H came dangerously close to impressing me.\n\nWith the plot being set up the way it is, H had a potentially brilliant subversion right in the palm of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand. With Ryosuke being a hopeless pervert who values women solely for their bodies, and who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s depth of character only reaches the level of \u00e2\u0080\u0098I like different poses,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and Lisara drawing her energy from that pervert power, the only thing this show had to do to have me eating out of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand was to not have anybody fall in love with him. If he was simply used as an object, as Lisara proclaimed in episode 1, then it would have been a very clever play on his habit of objectifying women. I can take the plot at face value\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Trust me, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot worse ideas out there\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And it makes sense that, under this arrangement she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d eventually get used to being naked around him. From there, she should have grown to see him as a necessary annoyance\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 A being less than a man, who she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel remotely threatened by, like a little kid, or a brainless dog. In fact, the entire harem could have seen him this way, adding a surprising edge of feminism to the heaping helping of boobs that the show throws at us.\n\nAnd as far as the romantic aspect of H goes, this change would have also helped Ryosuke become a much better character\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 He could have been emasculated by their treatment of him, faced his immature flaws, and forced himself to develop and grow in order to win more than just Lisara\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even begin to describe how refreshing a dynamic this would be, and I certainly can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t express how much good will I would have had for this title. But alas, this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t how things went\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Lisara\u00e2\u0080\u0099s promise to use him as a power source was nothing more than the same old cliched Tsundere bullshit that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve grown accustomed to.\n\nEvery girl in the harem falls madly in love with this skeezwad, and he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t start to show monogamous interest in anybody until the third quarter of the series, and it comes from pretty much out of nowhere, proving to the viewer that male perversion can only be overcome if a woman is willing to accept and tolerate it. Yeah, just love that womanizing douchebag, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll only have eyes for you eventually. I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really expecting any better than that, but it would have been nice.\n\nThen again, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like that message will ever reach the ears of anybody whom it could damage\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for the life of me imagine anybody enjoying this show without a bottle of lotion sitting beside them, and any negative message it sends will fly right over the heads of THAT market.\n\nOh, and speaking of all the girls falling in love with him, the funniest thing about H by far is how little it understands human emotion\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yeah, I know, big surprise, no harem characters are realistic. But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about a whole other level here. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not uncommon for harem girls to fall in love with the main character for no reason whatsoever, but this has to be the first anime I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen where one of the girls doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t start to show an interest in him until another girl suggests it. Yep\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 No exaggeration there. One of them says \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe both like Ryosuke,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and in so many words, the other one says \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do? Oh yeah, I do!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And the laziest love interest in the series was born.\n\nDo I even have to mention that it gets worse than that? There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a reveal halfway through that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably one of the most bewildering anime moments I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in a long time. Ryosuke skypes his mother for spoiler reasons, and a girl in the room asks her for some information regarding his bloodline. She says, in so many words, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, by the way, I lied about your father being dead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it. No hesitation, no reluctance, she just drops what should have been a ton of bricks on him out of nowhere and with not nearly enough prodding to suddenly break sixteen years of silence. And his reaction? Mild surprise at best. She gives him a quick explanation, and the subject gets dropped faster than the beat at a Skrillex concert. And no, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a spoiler worthy of a warning\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I wanted it to be, as I was pretty damn sure the villain would turn out to be his father in a mask, but it never gets brought up again. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even more bafflingly stupid than Ryosuke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mental dictionary.\n\nWhich reminds me\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Remember that plot I mentioned earlier? The one I begrudgingly decided to take at face value? Yeah, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about as consistent as an everlasting gobstopper. According to the back of the DVD cover, Ryosuke can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be perverted after Lisara\u00e2\u0080\u0099s used him for power, so he wants to help her so she can leave and his life can return to normal. Yeah, at no point in the show is that ever true. First of all, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the reason he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s helping her\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing it because she says he only has 3 months to live, and he wants her to save him. Second of all, he never stops being perverted\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Although even when she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s buck naked right in front of him, he has to (I wish I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember this) memorize all of the dirty words in a dictionary, so he can call any dirty word to his mind when needed. Because it takes obsessive studying to come up with the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cBath.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd third of all, his childhood friend makes a contract with Lisara\u00e2\u0080\u0099s childhood friend, and her passion for life comes from her love of Ryosuke\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Spoiler, yes, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll figure that out long before it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revealed. And get this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The exploitation of her life force NEVER causes her to stop being in love with him. I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a problem, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you? That is, aside from the problem of her being in love with a skeezwad.\n\nAnd oh, I know what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stupid, and shamelessly puts flesh on parade despite some gaping plot holes, inhuman behavior, and elements that make absolutely no sense. Hell, Strike Witches was a booby show, and the logic revolving around the panties makes for an incomprehensible plot hole, and you love Strike Witches!.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yeah, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re right. Strike Witches was a stupid, idiotic mess with copious amounts of bare boobs. But you know what it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t? Pretentious. Strike Witches was a blast from start to finish because it never tried to be anything deeper than action-packed cheesecake. But that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough for H.\n\nSee, the story gets serious in the second half\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, at least it tries, but all it ends up doing is making even less sense\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And it tries it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand at some real drama. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll spare you most of it, including Ryosuke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s uncanny transformation into a perfect gentleman the moment he gets a legitimate chance to pork somebody\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And talk about the villain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motive, which is going to be a difficult thing to do without giving away any spoilers.\n\nTo put it in ambiguous terms, the villain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motivation is driven by a disturbingly real threat to the very existence of life on this planet\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a threat that nobody is talking about yet, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even more controversial than climate change, and the people who try to take a stand against it are demonized for their efforts. This is quite possibly the first time I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen a fictional story try to tackle this issue, but as I learned before, I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expecting too much. Ryosuke and his harem are conflicted over this issue, which seems to be far too great a necessary evil to face\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And I swear to god, the solution this story comes up with is one of the most contrived fictional solutions I have ever heard for anything. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s steeped entirely in ignorance of human nature and whimsical sci-fi fantasy, which makes H feel all the more shallow and stupid for it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like listening to a ten year old say that Israel and Palestine should just hug it out, or seeing Superman solve the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s problems by sending all the nukes into space. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a cute idea, but for the love of god, please don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t write a freaking story bout it!\n\nIf I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t already made this clear, H is incompetent down to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lowest possible level. The jokes are bad, none of the characters are likeable, the nudity is too constant and over-saturated to remain sexy for longer than the space of a single episode, and the music is made up of cookie-cutter dating sim tunes. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s childish and stupid down to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very core, and while it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s offensive to women in some very creative ways, the only thing that keeps it from becoming completely morally repulsive is the fact that the harem in question doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t include any incestuous or lolicon characters. Hell, the one harem girl who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still in junior high is also the only girl in the entire show who never does any unobscured nudity, because yeah, THAT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to save it at this point. The only reason I can see anybody watching this is because of the boobs\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enough for you, then congratulations, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re eternally 14.\n\nSo I Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Play H is available on DVD and Blu-ray from Sentai Filmworks. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fairly inexpensive on most sites, with Amazon copies selling from 26 to 35 dollars, but if you were lucky enough, Rightstuf.com had it for 17.99 or 23.99, depending on your preferred format. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no dub as of yet, but knowing Sentai, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re probably just waiting tentatively to see if this title is popular enough to justify spending money on a dub. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a shame they have the rights to it, because a show like this really belongs in the hands of Funimation. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the few titles I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d actually LIKE to see Jamie Marchi write the script for.\n\nThe DVD doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t include the final thirteenth OVA episode, and while that omission may be a completionist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nightmare, I really think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better to just pretend that episode doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist. Why? Well, remember all those female characters that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already seen naked in every possible form of undress, and from every possible angle that won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t violate Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decency laws? Well, the final episode is a swimsuit competition! Yeah, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly what this show needed! No, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to learn more about the villain, or the whereabouts of Ryosuke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dad, or the societal results of this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s idiotic conclusion\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I wanna see my fetishes catered to even harder and more gratuitously than before, in an episode that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even a tenth as well animated as the series that preceded it.\n\nSo, as worthless as this show is, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really call it the bottom of the barrel. The animation, quite frankly, is too beautiful for that. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s close. And keep in mind, the ecchi genre dwells in a barrel that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s every bit as deep as the Mariana trench, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bottom is littered with even more despicable 1/10(or below) titles like Dears, Eiken, Love Love, Popotan, and Master of Martial Hearts. H is floating just a few feet above those titles, and about a dozen feet below School Days. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a place any anime wants to be\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Trust me, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really cold and dark down there, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where this title belongs, and I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wait to post this review and instantly go about the task of forgetting about it. I give So I Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Play H a 2/10."}, {"id": 3217, "score": 30, "body": "Hello there! Welcome to the world of adaptations! My name is Naru! This world is inhabited by creatures called Pokemon, who live in harmony with the humans who capture and train them! For some people, Pokemon are pets. Others use them for fights. For others, Pokemon are used for scientific testing, stored in suspended animation in large glass tubes while individuals far less ethically inclined than myself attempt to use them to perfect the art of cloning. This may not include you, an innocent and unassuming ten year old of indeterminate gender\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Seriously, what are you, a boy or a girl? Anyway, one particular scientist wanted nothing more than to use cloning to bring back his deceased daughter\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Because it worked so well for Shou Tucker\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 So they went on an expedition, found a fossil of the ancient Pokemon Mew, and while the artificial soul they created for little Amber may have faded away, after several failed experiments(which now exist in the wild as Dittos), they eventually succeeded in combining Mew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s DNA with that of a human\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to create a new Pokemon, the creatively named Mewtwo.\n\nBut the ability to think elaborately and ponder one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own existence apparently does not bode well for the young lab subject, who doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take his imprisonment and subjugation lying down. He blows the place up, kills everyone, and after some ill-advised soul searching with the leader of Team Rocket, he decides to strike out on his own and prove to the world that cloned Pokemon are not only superior to real Pokemon, but that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re completely independent of their human captors! He does this by taking over an island close to a popular port, building a base, and perfecting the cloning technology that was used to create three friends he can no longer remember the existence of. He employs a Dragonite that he met\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 somehow\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 to send out fliers advertising an event for only the best and brightest pokemon trainers in the immediate area to attend! He creates a massive storm to separate the real challengers from the\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not beat around the bush, corpses\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But by mistake, he also winds up bringing in Ash Ketchum, a trainer from Pallet Town, and his friends along for the ride! Will their main-characterness get in the way of his perfect evil plan, or will Mewtwo become the real reason Ash never turns 11?\n\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen the original Pokemon series, it would be fair to say that it was a low quality affair at best, and animation was one of the many things that you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really call it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strong suit. It was passable enough during battle scenes and the few repeated animations, such as Ash\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trademarked hat turn, but for the most part, the production company Team Ota kept costs low, relying on the lacking standards of child viewers to keep the project simple and inexpensive\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Or, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m assuming they did, but they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have that the rights to that excuse when they made Berserk. Yup, the Pokemon people animated Berserk. At it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worst, the series was embarrassing to look at, particularly in the early years. Most of the budget clearly went to visual effects, like the lighting effects of Pokemon being captured, Pokemon evolving, and certain intense battle scenes. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t badly directed or anything, as it was more than serviceable enough for young viewers, speedlines and other tricks are used more or less effectively, and the motion that occurred on screen was never wasted. There were a few too many dialogue-heavy staticky scenes, and I can tell you from a recent rewatch that the animators did get noticeably lazy in the middle of the Kanto arc, but it was fine for what it was.\n\nHaving said that, this movie was exactly what the anime analogue of a long-running anime should be\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 A giant step up in budget and quality control. The movie goes to a lot of really dark places, so appropriately enough, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a darker palette at play, and a far more frequent use of shadows than even the spookiest of episodes. There are a few moments that look to have had as low a budget as the series, particularly with one of the earlier scenes of Ash, Misty and Brock stopping for a lunch break, but when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s called for, the animation can get surprisingly fluid at times. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also quite a few shots incorporating CG, and yeah, they stick out like a sore thumb, but since the movie came out in 1999, we can give it a pass on that. It exercises a much better balance between the two styles than many of the newer movies, which use CG to such lavish degree that the standard animation has to suffer to compensate. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so effective over-all that with help from the soundtrack, certain scenes can feel unbelievably harrowing or at some points even creepy. For example, in the scene where Ash and his friends first arrive on New Island(yeah, they call it that), and are greeted by Mewtwo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assistant, the atmosphere is so warying that you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know WHAT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about to happen.\n\nAnd speaking of the music\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bit bipolar. There are two sides to it, the soundtrack and the score, and they clash even more than the fighting Pokemon do. The score, for what it is, is great. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not your typical collection of Pokemon background instrumentals, albeit scaled up to better portray the higher stakes and more epic nature of the story. Even when listened to out of context, these tunes convey very clear emotion, so I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I should have to tell you how effective it all is in context, whether you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hearing it in the movie in real time or on it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own terms on the extremely rare Score CD, and you have the actual events of the movie to pair it to. Quite a few of the tunes have an almost Danny Elfman-like quality to them, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean in the bouncy Springfield-like kind of way\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more like what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d hear from him in a Tim Burton project, with that sense of mystery and wonder guiding you through an otherwise bland and formulaic story. Some of my personal favorite tunes involve Birth of Mewtwo, which I believe only plays during the often-excluded origin story of the title character, the exciting track Freeing Charizard, and the bell-chorus/greek choir combo in Three on Three.\n\nThe Soundtrack, on the other hand\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Woof. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to start by saying that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not QUITE as dated as the soundtrack to the Digimon movie, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mostly because the songs that actually got crowbarred into the movie are all from no-name artists who might as well have died in the nineties, for all the world would ever care. Seriously, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve met modern day Hanson followers who have no idea who M2M ever was. Well, maybe that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not entirely true, I mean, Christina Aguilera and one of the Spice girls made it into the closing credits, which had four different songs jammed so tightly together that they actually kinda wound up bleeding into each other. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll admit that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a fan of the Billy Crawford version of the first Pokemon theme song, so sue me, it sounds awesome, and it was a fitting choice for the first real Pokemon battle Ash has in the movie, but it goes downhill from there. Artists like Brittney Spears and N\u00e2\u0080\u0099SYNC were lucky to get away with their dignity intact, somehow escaping with their least known songs being listed as \u00e2\u0080\u009cInspired by\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the CD(Yeah, right, Soda Pop was based on the Dept. Store health drink, gimme a break), but perhaps nobody comes out as badly as Blessid Union of Souls, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s track \u00e2\u0080\u009cBrother my Brother\u00e2\u0080\u009d has become synonymous with the film\u00e2\u0080\u0099s absolute worst moment.\n\nAnd yes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the American Pokemon release, done by 4Kids, so what are you really expecting me to say about the dub? I mean, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give it this, as bad as it was, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s considered The Glory Days now, especially when compared to the newer dubbing efforts. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bad, but then again, it was always bad, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no real difference between this dub and the TV series dub. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still lame jokes and obvious rewrites, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still lines of dialogue that misidentify various Pokemon, such as calling Pidgeot Pidgeotto and Scyther Alakazam\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 No, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not making that up\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But for a show that always ignored it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own logic, these screw-ups are hardly anything new. The original cast is still present, with voice acting legends Veronica Taylor, Rachel Lillis and Eric Stuart voicing at least half a dozen roles together, and of course Ikue Ohtani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still voicing Pikachu. Phillip Bartlett does an awesome job as Mewtwo, having also played the character in Pokemon Live, although he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t appear to have any other anime roles to his name. So yeah, the writing and translating is your typical Pokemon fare(save for a dumb Viking joke that not even the series would stoop to), and the acting\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also predictably decent. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult to find the original sub track, but trust me, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth the hunt.\n\nWhen I was younger, the fact that there was a Pokemon movie coming out was a huge deal. The series and games had been huge for years, the card game was so lucrative that it drew accusations of basically being a form of childhood gambling, it was an even bigger trend than Pokemon Go is now, and I can personally attest that it was a major part of my childhood. Fuck childhood, it bled into my teen years, and I was straight up obsessed. It took over my life to such an extreme degree, and yet I never saw the first movie in theaters. Nope. I waited for it to come out on DVD, at which point I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even buy it, I rented it. Why was this the case? How could such a forgiving, loyal pokefreak like myself give up the chance to see his favorite cartoon, western , eastern or otherwise on the big screen, and then not even bother securing a cpy for himself? I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. I seriously don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. I have no recollection whatsoever about what it was that made me turn my nose up at the idea of seeing this movie in theaters. Did my parents refuse to pay theater costs to see something we could see for free on TV? No, because we saw the second movie in theaters.\n\nAlso, both movies gave out promo cards, and I distinctly remember having very low standards, so\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 What the Psyduck? I can only imagine that it was one of two things\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Either I thought the trailers looked lame, which is entirely possible when you consider how I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve spent most of my life taking trailers way too seriously, so I could have just looked at 4Kids\u00e2\u0080\u0099 advertisement campaign and said \u00e2\u0080\u0098no thank you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 More likely, or perhaps even in conjunction with that issue, I might have gotten pissed off about how the title was a blatant rip-off of Empire Strikes Back. Like, \u00e2\u0080\u0098if this movie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as lazy as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s title, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want any part of it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Either way, I eventually did watch it on DVD, rental of course, and to my great shock, yeah, I had no urge whatsoever to purchase it. I know it has a lot of nostalgic value to a lot of people, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good damn reason that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tied with 4Ever for lowest critical score on Rottentomatoes. Honestly, I think the first time I ever purchased a physical copy of it might have been the one I bought this week for reviewing purposes. Keep in mind, this came out around the time that I thought Tim Burton created the superior Planet of the Apes movie.\n\nFirst of all, out of all the reviewers who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve torn this movie to shreds(and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been quite a few), I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen anybody call attention to just how badly executed the story is. Right off the bat, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re told everything there is to know about the titular character and primary antagonist, Mewtwo. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re told about his creation, his life with Giovanni, and depending what version you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re even shown a part of his past that he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember. This was a terrible idea, because not only does it ruin the possible mystery of his character, it takes focus and screen time away from the actual main characters, who are introduced in what can only be described as the third(or fourth) intro portion of the first act. Had Mewtwo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past been kept shrouded in mystery for the first half of the movie, and fed to us in snippets as each fact became relevant(IE, his history with Giovanni could have been glimpsed when Team Rocket heard their bosses name on a computer), it would have improved the film tenfold. Of course, going back to that example, his history with Giovanni was entirely pointless, aside from the connection it made to the series.\n\nAnd speaking of the first act, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d also like to call attention to the fact that this movie doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even bother trying to follow the basic three-act structure. Any movie, regardless of audience, is supposed to have a distinctive beginning, middle, and end, with occasional artistic diversions made for the sake of deliberately changing the norm and challenging the viewer. There are directors who specialize in this, such as Quentin Tarrantino and Christopher Nolan, but even when it comes to their non-linear story-telling styles, the final product can still be broken down into three distinct acts. This is one of the major reasons you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t approach screenwriting with the mindset of\u00e2\u0080\u009dThis happens, then this happens, then this happens, then this happens,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what about seventy percent of this movie amounts to. The first thirty percent, which I GUESS you could call the first act, is just a long string of introductions to various elements of the story, only the fourth of which has anything to do with the actual protagonist. Not only is the villain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s backstory AND motus operandi revealed first, giving it a feel of heavier important, but Ash and Friends also take a back seat to an entire sequence who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only purpose, as I mentioned before, is to connect the film to the series. Who are we supposed to be rooting for, again?\n\nThe second and third acts, if you can even call them that, bleed together into one long scene that takes place more or less in real time. I guess you could kind of separate the storm sequence and the introduction of the three other trainers who were able to make it to the island as a second act, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a brief one that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t leave much of an impression until Mewtwo once again hijacks the movie for the extended third act. Honestly, though, the single biggest flaw in the movie is just how hypocritical and non-sensical Mewtwo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plans really are, and if the film had been paced and structured better, we wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have had so much time in between his appearances to THINK about how little sense it all makes. Smarter execution could have amplified the emotional weight of his story, especially if the two major tear-jerking moments of the film had been juxtaposed against each other, with one happening in real time and the other happening afterwards as a flashback, making the conclusion of Mewtwo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character arc\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Because trust me, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only character in this stupid movie who HAS an arc\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 More effective on a more emotional level. Instead, the tragedy that ends this conflict just feels like a ridiculous ass-pull.\n\nAnd yeah, I hear what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re saying\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the first pokemon movie, obviously there were going to be some flaws. The writers likely weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t used to translating the pacing and structure of a TV episode into the higher demand of a full length movie, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll admit, that does play a huge factor in why this movie just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel right. Their approach would improve greatly with future movies, even if said projects went downhill in many other areas, but this first movie is structured like an episode of the show\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 You do a brief introduction of where everyone is, usually with the assistance of a narrator, and then the plot is revealed, which takes up the rest of the episode. Or, in this case, the movie. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t an entirely negative change, as the extended run time allows certain scenes to run way longer than the limits of TV would normally allow, making several action set pieces feel more intense, like Ash and friends struggling to survive the storm and reach new island, or an entire room full of Pokemon trying to either fight or flee from a hoard of Mewtwo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flying Pokeballs, which can somehow capture other Pokeballs.\n\nSo yes, the idea of this movie being an extended episode of the series can be sort of a double edged sword, at least in these respects. But even having said that, the argument falls flat when you look at just how stupid this movie is, and how many obvious mistakes it makes. Sure, the series was never what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d call well-written, but most of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dumbest aspects come from the characters themselves being fucking idiots, from Team Rocket\u00e2\u0080\u0099s frequent failures to our heroes not being able to recognize them, to Ash\u00e2\u0080\u0099s constant failures to capture almost any Pokemon he had the opportunity to catch. Oh, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wanna trade your Tauros? You have fucking thirty of them! And go back to pick up Pidgeot! Sorry, irrelevant, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been sitting on those rants for a while. Anywho, the mistakes made in the movie are a lot more obvious and in some cases just impossible to explain. Some of them are even more inexplicable than the questions of how Mewtwo, a freaking Pokemon, was able to build or acquire a massively technologically advanced base without anyone noticing, how he has the ability to brainwash people and why doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he just use this power to tell all the people in the world to stop being dicks, and so on and so forth. Seriously, imagine him mind-controlling Giovanni like that.\n\nBack in the late nineties, the only thing more exciting to Pokemon fans than the upcoming movie was the soon-to-be released second generation of Pocket monsters. The movie, brilliantly enough, decided to capitalize on this by teasing us with three new critters, not including Togepi. The first two appeared in Pikachu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vacation, an OVA that aired before the movie, but the one that was reserved for the movie was Donphan, which you would think means he would be a big deal\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But no, he gets beaten faster than CM Punk in UFC. Great representation, there. After this, we go to the docks, where trainers want to brave the storm Mewtwo created to answer their invitations, and we get this strange, unnamed woman saying that the storm is some prophecy called The Winds of Water. This is of course not connected to anything, or ever referenced again. The main cast take a freaking canoe to cross the ocean in a storm that a giant ferry isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fit for, which is probably the only mistake that feels like it would happen in the show, and then the ending has the balls to tell us that fighting is wrong, and that pokemon aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t meant to fight each other, in a movie based on a franchise that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s based entirely around the art of strategic combat. This is the textbook definition of having your cake and eating it too, and yeah, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a reason this is literally EVERYBODY\u00e2\u0080\u0099S biggest complaint about the film. I my opinion, though, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not even it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worst problem.\n\nPokemon: The first movie is available stateside in a few different formats, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s any way to buy a region 1 version of the original Japanese release, or even if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a version with the original Birth of Mewtwo scene attached to it. The old DVD releases have slightly more features than the better looking recent releases, and they can be found for much cheaper on Ebay than on amazon. It can also be found in a few different three-pack formats, included with the second and third movies, for an okay price. There are a ton of other entries in the franchise, including way too many seasons of the show, and over a dozen other movies, which I may or may not visit in the future.\n\nWhen I bring up my issues with this movie in the company of other people, the most common defenses it gets aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the ones I mentioned earlier. The first one is the nostalgia argument, which\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Okay, yeah, I kinda get that one. I liked Space Jam as much as the next child. You grew up with it, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to you, so you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re forgiving of it. This actually leads into the other defense, that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a movie for kids. One day, little viewers who watch it now are going to have the same nostalgic reaction to it. Well, if all you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for is something bright and colorful to keep your kids quiet for an hour and a half, this movie is fine. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s innocent and inoffensive, and the fact that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moral is confused and hypocritical shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t damage them seriously. But if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for, you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be reading a review right now. The fact of the matter is that there ARE really good movies out there for children, movies that teach and enlighten while they entertain, and that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deserve to be lumped together with movies like this one just because they both reach the low standard of \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt exists, and nothing offensive happens.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This movie may check those two boxes, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a soulless, lazy cash-grab that does nothing important for the franchise other than set up the far superior Mewtwo Returns, and even THAT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just my opinion. Aside from that, it really doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do anything to justify it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own existence or continued relevance. I give Pokemon: The First Movie a 3/10.  "}, {"id": 3223, "score": 40, "body": "~~~We all love telling tales of the past,\nBe they epic, romantic or scary\nStories of people long since dead\nthough levels of truth may vary\n\nFor such is the tale of Sachiko,\nand the tragedy of Heavenly Host\nA school long lost \u00e2\u0080\u0098tween heaven and hell\neach student and teacher a ghost.\n\nA simple chant will bind you as friends,\nSo why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you give it a try?\nBut make one mistake and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all it takes\nTo suffer and surely to die.\n\nWhen wandering these decrepit halls\nBe brave, be clever and true\nFor many a soul has been trapped here\nAnd the next one might be you.~~~\n\nSorry about that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m no poet, and that was probably terrible, but I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t resist. For a proper plot summary, Corpse Party is the story of seven high school students, their teacher and a little girl who get together one night to tell a juicy urban legend that one of them heard online\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 One that comes not only with thrills, chills and intrigue, but with a cute little charm that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supposed to link all of them as friends forever. But suddenly, and with no explanation, the charm backfires, and sucks them screaming and horrified into a twisted, disturbing world that wastes no time in splitting them up and running them through the meat grinder\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Almost literally in a few cases.\n\nIn order to escape from this world that Silent Hill has screaming nightmares about, the dwindling students will have to solve the mystery behind the Heavenly Host massacre, examining the blurry lines between the truth of what happened and the story that became public knowledge. And if that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem hard enough, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to do this while avoiding the demons and ghosts who want nothing more than to spread their eternal suffering to others. With the odds stacked against them, and no horrors being spared on their behalf, can any of these forsaken friends overcome their fate and live to see the real world? Or are their tortured souls doomed to hell for eternity?\n\nThe Corpse Party OVA was produced by a studio called Asread, a small time production company that originated as an off-shoot of Studio Xebec. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve released a surprisingly small amount of titles, ranging from the misogynistic Shuffle to the plot-hole pin-cushion known as Future Diary. By all means, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d expect them to shaft a four episode OVA that nobody wanted to see with as little effort and money and possible\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 In other words, this anime should look like ass.\n\nIn spite of this, I was pleasantly surprised by the over-all look of this OVA. Okay, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no visual wonder\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The budget was clearly a small one, and this fact is betrayed to the viewer in several scenes, most notably of which occurs right at the very beginning when the nine are saying their chant. For most of the series, however, the visuals are executed nicely, teasing your eye with suspicious framing and backgrounds full of gritty, unsettling details. Everything in Heavenly Host looks appropriately ancient, with the corpses scattered throughout the building in varying states of decay, and mold and grime covering every inch of the building\u00e2\u0080\u0099s walls.\n\nThe character designs, while somewhat distinctive, are disappointingly generic. You could argue that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a point to this, as there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no real main character in this series(the protagonist from the game has been brought down to everyone else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s level), and everybody looks like they could be a secondary or stock character in any other show. You could make this excuse, and there is some logic behind it, but it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make the cast look any less dull or any more memorable. The animation shines through in some scenes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Where there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suspense or gut-wrenching horror to portray, the animation becomes solid enough to make up for the over-all cheapness. The visual effects of the ghosts alone justifies the unevenly allocated budget. The music is just as spooky as it needs to be, and while there are no real stand-out tracks, it does it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job well enough to amp up the tension and shock whenever needed.\n\nBefore we go any further, I should probably mention that this OVA was based on a video game series that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s developed a strong cult following since it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s release back in 1996, despite not getting a sequel until 2008. The series then took off, spawning countless new games and manga adaptations, as well as an eleven minute OVA that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s completely worthless and the four episode OVA that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m discussing today. Having said that, adapting video games into the visual medium is a notoriously hard thing to do, so how did this iteration of the story hold up?\n\nWell, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always held onto the belief that an adaptation doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to be accurate\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It can change as much as it likes, as long as it manages to put forth a good stand-alone story. The problem with applying that belief to Corpse Party is that, as far as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen from the handful of let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s play videos that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen, this anime only tells a fraction of the story. Most video game movies will find ways to work around the gameplay aspect of their source material or just omit it completely, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of a necessity in terms of keeping the story from getting repetitive\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of story and character development in Corpse Party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gameplay, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sorely missing from the OVA.\n\nThe first episode is executed decently enough, as it goes through the prologue and then spends the rest of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time focusing on two specific characters. They interact with each other and explore the haunted school for a bit, allowing the horror to set in with a very effective slow burn, leading to the first of many shocking death scenes. However, the pacing issues become immediately apparent when the second episode starts, and the story suddenly shifts to cover the rest of the characters and their situations, as well as expositing about many of the rules and properties of Heavenly Host.\n\nI haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t played the game, which is why I can say with complete sincerity that you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to have any behind-the-controls experience to know that tons of material was left behind for the sake of adaptation. This is most apparent from one particular scene where two characters figure out what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to do to put the ghost children to rest. We switch focus to other characters, and by the time we get back to these two, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already completed the bulk of the task. The entire anime is like this, jumping from important plot point to important plot point, throwing away almost all of the mood and complexity of the source material to get through the story as quickly as possible.\n\nThe mystery element of the story, which gave the game it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s celebrated sense of intrigue, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t slowly revealed as each piece is discovered\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Which I do believe they could have accomplished with an extra episode and a clever rewrite. Instead, the entire backstory is dumped on you through exposition towards the end, and it grinds the story to a halt faster than the third act of the first Silent Hill movie. It tells the backstory completely\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Or at least I think it does\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And they do kind of manage to tell it organically through the characters and their discoveries, and while I have to give them some credit for that, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop the sequence from feeling like I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m reading it out of a text book, and it spoils any feeling of immersion it may have had because of this.\n\nThe characters also suffer, and not just in the literal sense. With all of their development and background information glossed over, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re simplified down to the barest of possible tropes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got the class rep, the gropy lesbian, the genki girl, the obsessive fanboy, the blonde punk, the overly-attached idealized loli, the blank slate protagonist, etc. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very difficult to become attached to any of these characters, which causes their occasional demises to lose a lot of the emotional impact that they should have had. There are so many details I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hear until after the fact that would have made so much more sense had I heard them in the show. Apparently, two of the female character were competitively in love with the male protagonist. Apparently, one of them was his childhood friend. Apparently, this whole ritual was performed to strengthen this group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friendship because one of them was about to move away. I should have known these things!\n\nHell, as little as I know of the game, maybe some of the obvious plot holes make more sense in it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stated that when you die in Heavenly Host, your existence is completely erased from the real world, which makes no sense, because the entire reason they tried this ritual is because of the blog entries of a girl who was already killed and trapped there. Her blog should have never existed, right? And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to throw out any serious spoilers, but what was up with that twist at the end? What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the logic behind that one? Is any of this explained in the actual game?\n\nNow after all that bitching, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re probably expecting me to say that this show is awful, and that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a poorly executed gore fest that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deserve any of your time or attention. And in some ways, I guess that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 So why do I like this show so much? Why do I derive so much guilty pleasure out of what is so obviously a trainwreck? To explain what Corpse Party does right, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to have to compare it to another horror anime that I reviewed last week, Another.\n\nThese two shows have very similar plots. They both take place in haunted schools where a bunch of unfortunate students are being ruthlessly killed off by a curse. The differences, however, are vast. The ghost in Another feels more like a sadistic mob boss than a vengeful spirit, while in Corpse Party, the ghosts are far more firmly defined and straightforward. In Another, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to ignore the many ways that the curse could have possibly been broken, while in Corpse Party, the situation really does feel hopeless. In Another, one of the characters has a power that she refuses to take advantage of until at least eight more people have died, but in Corpse Party, you can tell the characters are doing whatever they can to get home. Also, unlike Another, Corpse Party doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try too hard to look spookier than it is by arbitrarily making one of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s characters obsessed with Gothic things.\n\nIn Another, the body count seems to have an ulterior motive running contrary to the established tone of the series. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a huge body count, but none of the deaths feel scary, as they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re either plot related, included for spectacle, or\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really talk about this in my review of the series, but a lot of the female deaths are sexually suggestive in nature, as most of the girls are killed through penetration, strangulation, and one of them lands in a sexual position after falling from a window. It feels more like a sexually repressed revenge fantasy, with the ghost serving as a self-insert character, rather than a genuine horror title.\n\nCorpse Party doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have that problem. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult to get attached to the characters, so their deaths aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to break your heart, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still framed and executed in terrifying ways, feeling exactly as horrifying and nauseating as they were meant to. Even if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care whether or not the characters live, you still feel the pain and terror that they feel. The deaths aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t played over-the-top for spectacle, neither are they sexualized, save for one or two incidental panty shots. Yes, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stabbings and strangulation, but the way they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re presented is so gruesome and gritty that even the most hardcore gore-porn addicts wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be aroused by them. In this way, Corpse Party succeeds in the most basic of ways\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s genuinely scary. The pacing, while bad, still allows for suspense, which makes the inevitable splatters all the more crushing, even though it feels kind of cathartic to see so many annoying archetypes killed. Either way, no death ever feels hollow or pointless to the narrative.\n\nBut I think the main reason I like it so much is because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the perfect Japanese equivalent of a slasher film. The vast majority of those kinds of movies aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t good by any means, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still so fun, gory and cheesy with no pretensions of being anything more that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a blast to watch on a dark and stormy night, whether you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re alone or with friends. At only two hours long, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t waste any time between scares, making it the absolute best anime to watch on Halloween. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always loved gory horror films that are perfectly fine with people seeing them for exactly what they are, and Corpse Party makes me nostalgic for the days when I was a teenager, watching grindhouse horror movies at my friends houses while my over-protective parents didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know about it. I get that it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have that value with most viewers, but it has it with me, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what counts.\n\nCorpse Party: Tortured Souls is available from Section23 Films, via Sentai Filmworks.   The manga is available stateside from Yen Press, and the visual novels are available on both PS Vita and Nintendo 3DS.  An eleven minute prequel called Extra Footage is not available stateside, but it's terrible, so you're not missing anything.  I haven't seen the live action movie, but it's probably no better.  It is available on DVD and bluray, though.\n\nWhen I originally wrote this review a few years ago, Corpse Party was nowhere near available in the US, and in all honesty, that scarcity actually worked in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favor, making it feel even more like a back-alley bootleg of a show that you weren't supposed to be watching. That appeal was limited, however, and now it's gone.  Even if it wasn't, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t justify giving it credit just on the merit of my own guilty pleasure\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a train wreck, frankly, and while the many things it does wrong do prevent me from giving it any kind of firm recommendation, the few things it does right are important enough to save it from being completely unwatchable. I give Corpse Party: Tortured Souls a 4/10. "}, {"id": 3225, "score": 30, "body": "Space\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It was once considered by the people of Earth to be the final frontier.

As we entered this conflict, forced into the struggle for galactic dominance, we were dubbed the iron tribe. But with the regal albinos of the Silver tribe and the larvae-looking Bronze tribe teaming up against us, we were faced with the inevitability of not just defeat\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But extinction.\n\nThat is, until one fateful day when Dhianeilla, the princess of the human race, and the crew of her space ship The Argonaut stumbled across a half-destroyed planet, inhabited predominately by terrestrial squids. Living amongst the squids, they found a childlike young man; Savage in appearance yet kind of heart, his name was Age, and he alone possessed the ability to defend us against the worst that our enemies could dish out. But will this curious young savior be enough? Is he strong enough to bring about an end to this horrible war? Is he heroic enough to do so with as little bloodshed as possible? Or will he fail, dooming us to obscurity? One thing is certain: Without Age, this frontier truly will be our final one.\n\nStudio Xebec is a name that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve often heard spoken in painful, frustrated tones by many different reviewers. And hey, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to add my name to that list. If animation studios were being sold in the supermarket, Xebec would be the store-brand option\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m talking Great Value levels of cheapness. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the same company that produced Love Hina and the first Negima series, and the 2D animation in Heroic Age is a slight improvement over those works, with much better use of coloring, but as far as basic animation goes, this is pretty much the same stiff, lifeless crap that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve become used to seeing from them.\n\nHaving said that, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still going to give credit where credit is due. The animation looks awful whenever characters are on screen, or with any shots that take place on land or inside the space ships, but when we leave those setting and venture out into open space, the switch in visual quality is like night-and-day. The 3D animation in Heroic Age is nothing short of beautiful. This series came out in 2007, so the CG looks a little dated, but it still holds up really well. The spaceships themselves look awesome at all times, but what\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll really catch your eye is the expansive outer-space backgrounds, which are full of life and color\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Although when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sharing screen time with the 2D characters, the styles really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mesh well together.\n\nAs far as the character designs go, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very little inspiration or originality here. The silver tribe\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The primary antagonists of the series\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Are emotionless, so of course they all have long white hair. Yeah, if you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen an anime where the villain had long white hair, then you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t watch much anime. There are several characters who appear to have had their aesthetic lifted directly out of Leiji Matsumoto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sketchbook, and thinking back, the only designs that really stand out are that of Age and a few less humanoid aliens, such as the bronze tribe and his squid friends.\n\nOddly enough, the one aspect of the character design that stands out in my memory is the sheer number of baffling choices that the creators made in regard to the female characters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 uniforms. On the low end of the scale, you have several members of Dhianeila\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crew\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Including the princess herself\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Who are wearing uniforms so skin-tight that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d swear they were painted on. I actually kind of wish that were the case, because otherwise, those poor girls are experiencing the most uncomfortable wedgies in human history. That, and somehow the suits indent enough to show off their belly buttons. On the high end of the scale, there are a few high-ranking female characters whose outfits were designed to have gaping, cleavage-baring holes in the front, and I would LOVE to hear the practical applications of this dress-code choice. I highly doubt they did that for the sake of sexiness or fan-service, because with Xebec\u00e2\u0080\u0099s art quality, one poor character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cleavage looks more like ass-cheeks than anything else in most shots.\n\nThe music is your standard sci-fi fantasy fare\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen any anime like this, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard soundtracks exactly like this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6  But the English dub, on the other hand, is much more unique. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard quite a few bad dubs from Funimation before. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard them release dubs that were written poorly, directed poorly, or cast poorly. But through it all, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always felt that they were at least trying. No, phoned-in dubs were always more of an ADV thing than a Funimation thing. Heroic Age is the first dub I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard from them where it sounds like most of the people involved just didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care.\n\nIn a cast full of late-2000s Funimation regulars, there are several actors who didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to reach very far into their bags of stock voices to find the right one for their respective characters. Monica Rial plays her usual squeaky-cheerful voice, aged up slightly for the dual roles of the twins Mail and Tail. Luci Christian raises her voice ever so slightly for the role of Dhianeila\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal attendant Aneasha, and Greg Ayres does his usual Greg Ayres thing for the meek Mehitak. Think Negi Springfield, but without the accent. Colleen Clinikenbeard plays another deep-voiced tough woman, Christopher Sabat plays what he likes to call a \u00e2\u0080\u0098coffee break role,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and so on and so forth.\n\nVic Mignona plays a scheming antagonist, which is fun to listen to, but he barely gets any lines. The only actors who seem to have brought any genuine effort to the table are Cherami Leigh, who plays the tortured Lekty, a member of the Silver Tribe who slowly learns affection and emotion with the help of a fellow Nodos who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been tasked with protecting her\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Cherami put out a compelling amount of pain through this character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s development\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And Brina Palencia, who gracefully dances the line between adorable mascot and helpful navigator in her role as the ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AI system, Bee No Bee.\n\nAnd then you have the two main voice actors. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even know where to begin with this one. J Michael Tatum plays the titular character, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably the only time I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever heard him attempt to do a high-pitched, wistful voice. Thank God for that. Every single line he utters sounds like he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s making fun of Johnny Yong Bosch. Tatum generally has a very pleasant, soothing voice, and his performance as Age is proof that he should stick to that voice as often as possible.\n\nAnd yet, his female co-star is still worse. Caitlin Glass plays the role of Princess Dhianeila, and I am sorry to say this about any character voiced by her, but she will put you right the hell to sleep. She gives monotone a new meaning with her soft-voiced, droning delivery. She sounds like a lazy LOTR-style opening narration, which makes it even more grating to the attention span when she doles out exposition about long-winded prophecies or soliloquies about Age\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feelings.\n\nTogether, these two voice actors turn the series into a boring, dull slog that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s often a chore to watch. They have absolutely no chemistry, which is insane because\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stress this enough\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the voice actors for Isaac and Miria in Baccano. Yeah, these two one-note windbags are directly linked to the most electrifying and entertaining couple in anime history. This is the only thing that ever surprised me about this series. The Japanese actors for both characters are far superior, able to hit the same basic tones while showing so much more personality in the process.\n\nThe show had a whole slew of people working on the adaptive writing, and yes, it feels it. There were several different writers and ADR directors taking turns like a revolving door, and out of the three script writers attached to the project, two of them were actually good. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always known Monica Rial to be a talented writer, and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always been able to adapt material in such a way that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accessible without losing it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intent or meaning. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m new to Brandon Potter, but he did a decent job as well.\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when we talk about the third writer\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 J Michael Tatum\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 That we run into some serious problems. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a generally well-liked actor, and rightfully so\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But when it comes to scripting a dub, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s become notorious for over-writing. My least favorite kind of writers are the ones who think they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re better than the material, and take every possible opportunity to make themselves look like the cleverest person in the room, which Tatum does by replacing subtle and in-character dialogue with over-used cliches, purple prose, and bizarrely out-of-place idioms that make a mockery of the text while, in some cases, changing the intent of it all together.\n\nHere, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give you an example from episode sixteen. At one point, one of Age\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enemies is defeated, and brought onto the Argonaut. When confronting Age, he expresses reluctance to the idea of fighting him again, and is relieved when he hears that they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to. This makes sense in character, because this guy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always been pacifistic throughout the story, and the idea of engaging in an all out brawl with Age in the middle of a populated spaceship will cause countless casualties. But in the dub, Tatun changes his line to \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to hurt me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Down-grading it from a sentiment of compassion to a sentiment of selfish cowardice. And yes, there are worse examples in here. Definitely stick to the subtitles on this one.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been putting off reviewing this series for a few years now\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 No exaggeration there, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m dead serious\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And in that time, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always been floating over my head as something I would have to tackle eventually. But there were two problems. The first one was that I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be able to watch it all the way through a second time. And the second was that, as many problems as I have with it, I had no idea how I was going to present my biggest problems with this series. So now that the time has finally come, I think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to start with the problem that I like to bring up whenever someone asks me why I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like this series\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talk about the title character.\n\nAge is a kind-hearted, childish savage who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not human by birth. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the last surviving remnants of a tyrannical race of warriors that were almost completely wiped out by a more powerful force. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s picked up by a crew consisting of mostly humans, and a lot of quirky hijinks ensue as a result of their many differences. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eventually revealed that he has the ability to transform into a giant, ferocious monster with it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own name that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unique to his, and he has to fight the other few remnants of his species if he wants to protect the human race from extinction. In other words, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Goku. Yup. Just Goku. He doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the personality, depth, or charm of Goku, but when you get right down to it, he was ripped wholesale out of the DBZ universe.\n\nNow, is unoriginality a bad thing? Not necessarily. Bleach ripped it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s initial premise straight out of Yuyu Hakusho, and I actually like the first three seasons of Bleach MORE than it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s predecessor. But then you have my next problem\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Heroic Age is really stupid. This show knows about as much about outer space physics as I did in elementary school. There are plenty of rules you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re allowed to break in science fiction\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Sound and color don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist in space, but very few Sci-fis care about that. Heroic Age breaks the rules you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re allowed to break, as well as the ones you aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Not only do many of the characters move through open space as though they were swimming under-water, but in episode two, we see the main character digging a hole through the hull of the Argonaut in order to attack the villains waiting outside.\n\nHey, do you remember Jason X, the Friday the 13th movie where Jason Voorhies kills a bunch of people in outer space? Pretty cool, huh? One of the characters was killed when Jason broke a hole in the hull from outside, and she was sucked through that hole. That was the dumbest movie in an entire franchise of dumb movies, but even THAT story knew that when you compromise the hull of a space ship, shit goes terribly wrong. Also, I get that Age and the other Nodos can breathe in space, but an inhuman biology doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t explain outer space wind blowing through their hair. Someone had to animate that.\n\nBut much like unoriginality, stupidity is not a deal breaker. There are plenty of shows that were awesome, despite having the IQ of mayonnaise, but they usually offer up some redeeming qualities to make up for it. Gurren Lagann is stupid, but it has so much energy and confidence that you just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but believe in it. Knights of Sidonia is incredibly stupid\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Probably even more so than Age, now that I think about it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so creative and sincere that it honestly just comes off as fun and adorable. Heroic Age doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have anything like that. In fact, rather than making up for it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stupidity, it compounds that problem with it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s insistence on looking smarter and deeper than it actually is.\n\nAt the start of this review, I gave a heavily simplified(and not 100% accurate) plot summary of this series. What I left out was all the over-complicated pulp. Heroic Age goes up it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own ass to establish a long-winded and often self-contradictory lore about the many tribes vying for control of the universe, which never serves as anything other than an explanation for the setting. There are scattered references to Greek mythology, namely to the five ages of man, but these references are in name alone, and the tribes named after them have little to nothing to do with the ages they correspond to. The only reason Age is a descendant of the Heroic Age is because the creators wanted to emphasize how heroic HE was, never mind the fact that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also comparing a brutal race of murderers to one of the most noble ages of the five. The tribes could just have easily been named after different ice cream brands, with the show being called Haagen-Daas Age, and it would have had just as much depth to it.\n\nBut is pretending to have depth or meaning a deal breaker? Not on it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry, \u00e2\u0080\u0098stupid\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and \u00e2\u0080\u0098pretentious\u00e2\u0080\u0099 are not good bed-fellows. This show would have been a lot easier to watch if it had dropped all attempts at undeserved profundity, and had just told the simple story that I mentioned earlier\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Only it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, because of this series\u00e2\u0080\u0099 final, and biggest, problem. Heroic Age, at it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core, is just very badly written.\n\nThere are a ton of characters floating around in it, but Age is the only one who even gets the slightest hint of a backstory, and not one of them have any complex motivations. The two main characters\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Age and Dhianeilla\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 have no personality outside of the fact that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re good people who are always right about everything, and everyone else just exists to support or oppose them. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen this show twice, and I cannot describe a single one of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s characters with anything more than a two-sentence explanation of what they are and who they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re connected to.\n\nAnd it apparently isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel invested in any of the characters\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even enjoy the action of these epic space battles because of how muddled and poorly edited these multi-episode set pieces are. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll notice quickly that during these long battles, there is a LOT going on, at many different locations, involving many different characters, often at different times. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get a few seconds of Age fighting his brethren, followed by a cut to Princess Expositia explaining to us what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going through, followed by a cut to the political squabble involving her scheming brothers, to a cut to the other Nodos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 loitering around and discussing their lot in life, to a conversation someone had with Age earlier, and by the time they finally cut back to Age\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fight in current time, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve all but forgotten what he was doing there in the first place, which is the final nail in the coffin for a series I had to struggle to care about.\n\nHerioic Age is available from Funimation. The old releases are still available in relatively affordable halves, but you can get a much better deal by going with the SAVE release, which you can find pretty much anywhere for between fifteen and twenty dollars. The manga, which released it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first volume during the initial run of the series, is pretty much the same story told from another character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perspective, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not available in the states.\n\nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like Heroic Age. I also don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hate Heroic Age. Hell, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anything Heroic Age. I gained nothing from this series, and in exchange, I lost way too much time on a series that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to forget in less than a week. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest crime isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the fact that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stupid, pretentious, badly animated, or generic. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest crime is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boring. I can stare at the screen for several episodes in a row, with no distractions, and I still have to constantly rewind to pick up on what the hell I missed in regard to what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad to finally put this turkey behind me, and I look forward to forgetting it exists. I give Heroic Age a 3/10. "}, {"id": 3226, "score": 1, "body": "-Mild spoilers\n\nSoichiro is a fan of folksy, upbeat swedish-style pop music, and he dreams of pursuing a career in making said music. He leaves his home in the country to move to the big city, where he somehow winds up as the frontman of a death metal band\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 This is never explained\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 wearing a costume that seems to be *cough* inspired by the American rock band Kiss. This band, which has achieved fame and fervor throughout the disaffected youth of Japan, is called \u00e2\u0080\u009cDetroit Metal City.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd thus young Soichiro is torn\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 In his personal life, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the exact opposite of his stage persona, Johannes Krauzer 2, a hardcore demon who (allegedly) brutally murdered his parents and rapes pretty much whatever he wants to, whenever he wants to. Despite his talent with this music, Soichiro despises it, and wants nothing more than to escape it all and engage in a career that will make both his family and the girl of his dreams proud of him\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And yet he just keeps getting pulled back.\n\nI know I played up this plot summary as a nuanced character study, but trust me, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot less interesting than it sounds.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to have a difficult time talking about the animation, mostly because in order to do so, I have to use the word animation\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Which is a word this series never really deserves to be associated with. DMC has some of the cheapest, laziest looking animation that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in my entire life. At it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best, it looks like someone took pictures from the manga, colored them in, and flipped back and forth between them just to create the illusion of movement. At its worst, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stiff, jarring, contains way too many key frames, and abuses speed lines worse than Naruto.\n\nThe character designs aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that bad, as everybody seems realistically proportioned in both their bodies and their faces. Yep, nothing cartoony or moe to speak of, so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a plus. Oh, except for a few chunky midgets\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Because Japan loves its midgets. But with that aside, this show is barely animated, save for the opening.\n\nSay, do you remember Method and Red, a single season Fox show from just over ten years ago? No, of course you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Nobody does. Although you should, because that show was pretty damn funny. Anyway, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about rappers Methodman and Redman moving into a wealthy, upscale, predominately white neighborhood. At one point, one of the characters\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 An uptight yuppie mother from the Neighbors Association\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 calls rap music \u00e2\u0080\u009cX-rated nursery rhymes that objectify women.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Was that fair of her to say? No, not really. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m no connoisseur of the genre, but I know enough to know that rap music is at least a bit more diverse than a lot of people who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never paid attention to it are willing to give it credit for.\n\nNow, imagine if that woman was tasked to write an entire comedy series based on her perception of the genre. The very idea of this is cringeworthy, right?\n\nWell, Detroit Metal City had a character like her. That character was called\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The writer. No, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that literally, like there was some meta character named The Writer\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I mean the actual writer who created and penned this masterpiece. Because if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a fan of Death Metal\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And a fan of this show\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Then I have a really disappointing observation I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to share with you. Are you ready? Here it is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 DMC hates Death Metal. It hates the music, it hates the musicians, and it hates you. And it is absolutely giddy about the fact that you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t figured that out yet.\n\nAnd if you think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just pulling this out of my ass, just look at how that form of music is portrayed in the series. A nice, well mannered young man gets mixed up in it, whereupon he develops a split personality, and that personality happens to be angry, abusive, and violently misogynist. Yes, I know it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s explained in the manga that he has unresolved rage issues that he vents through his stage persona, but rageaholics aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t typically known to compulsively dry-hump other men and inanimate objects. And when they are, they need professional help, not a recording contract. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also made very clear that this alternate personality of his has the power to absolutely destroy his personal relationships, and yet he can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop going back to it. Kind of like hard drugs, or Rock and Roll in a fifties-style afterschool special.\n\nWhich is saying nothing about the music, which is literally about nothing other than sexual aggression and murder. And I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use the word literally lightly. The opening theme\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 In other words, the very first song we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re exposed to out of the entire show\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Is a DMC song where Soichiros very first lines are \u00e2\u0080\u009cYesterday I raped my mother, today I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to kill my father.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a hint of irony or satire in it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Throughout the show, his fans really believe that Krauzer is a demonic criminal who raped and murdered his parents as a child and was let out of jail to make music. A lie that the band promotes with a straight face.\n\nAs for the rest of the music, it ranges from \u00e2\u0080\u009cKill and enslave everybody\u00e2\u0080\u009d to \u00e2\u0080\u009cWomen are sex pigs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And this is meant to be funny.\n\nMetalocalypse is another show that paints Death Metal as violent and misogynistic. You know why it was awesome? Because it was creative, funny, well produced, and knew damn well how to go to some of the worst possible places without ever becoming too offensive. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a show that felt genuine love and passion for it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s subject, and as such, it was able to put everything that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s awesome about Death Metal on full display while over-exaggerating and ruthlessly parodying the things that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so awesome about it. DMC couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do that, and throughout the entire thirteen episode run, it felt more like a cautionary tale against Death Metal\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 With enough knowledge and research behind it to make Reefer Madness look legit.\n\nThis wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be a problem if DMC was written well, but alas, this just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the case. I know there are some people who would say \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a gag comedy based on a four panel manga\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Of course it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not written well! You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expecting too much of it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Well, dear reader, you just insulted your show far more than I ever could, because there are plenty of anime with similar adaptive roots, and this is by far the least amusing one I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen. The only character with enough personality traits to even be considered a character would be the main one, and while there is some complexity to his situation, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entirely contrived, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so stupid that it makes him really difficult to root for.\n\nOut of the other characters who matter\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s see\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I know there were a few\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Oh! There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Capitalist Pig, a middle aged midget who gets tied up, gagged, and abused on-stage. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s okay, because he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a masochist. Yeah, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all well and good, but his only significant story arc was about Soichiro trying to set him up with the girl of his dreams, and then blatantly dicking him over at the most crucial moment, just to be thanked anyway right afterwards.\n\nUmm\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s his little brother, who got so turned onto Soichiro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s music that he grew his hair out, dyed it, and now refuses to go to school or help out around the farm. And the resolution for that problem was\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, really stupid, and never ever brought up again, except for a throwaway gag in the last episode involving a cow.\n\nThere are three women who play somewhat significant roles in the show\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Kind of\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the band\u00e2\u0080\u0099s manager, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only personality trait is that she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care about anything that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make her wet. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the lead singer of a punk band, who was stupid enough to believe a Japanese guy with a cold was the reincarnation of legendary rocker Sid Vicious. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also Yuri(Yay! I remembered someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name without looking it up!), Soichiro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s former friend from college, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interested in him despite not being very close to him in school. Her attraction to him is never explained, but she hates Death Metal and all it represents. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something wrong with both of those statements, as there are several moments in the show where Soichiro acts VERY verbally abusive towards her without ever suffering any consequences. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m assuming she still likes him afterwards, because she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t appear in any of the last few episodes.\n\nMuch like certain other shows I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve reviewed, or plan to review, the writing in DMC has one other serious flaw\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so dependent on coincidence that pretty much everything that happens can be predicted at some point during it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s respective episode. This is true not only with the pop band Tetrapod Melon Tea(For the love of god don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ask) and the American villain from the final episode. While surrendering to the police for disturbing the peace, Soichiro trips and just happens to smash one of them over the head with his guitar. Because of course he does. He then stumbles backwards into a female officer, and falls onto her in a very rapey way, then runs off while fans chant about his nefarious deeds. This is never followed up on, nor is his humping of a certain famous monument\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Which them lights up and is rained upon, another complete coincidence that adds to his legacy.\n\nOn top of that, the very premise\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 bland main character has to keep their secret identity secret so the two sides of his life won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ever find out about each other\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Has been done to death and beyond, and as far as execution goes, this take on the concept is about as consistent and well thought out as Hannah Montana. There are several instances where his personal identity should have been blown wide open, and yes, most of them involve police. We go through the same tired plot episode after episode, with Soichiro forced into situations where he somehow protects his secret identity despite idiotically and \u00e2\u0080\u0098hilariously\u00e2\u0080\u0099 screwing it up every time, and for what? For characters that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not even expected to remember in the last few episodes.\n\nFor the longest time, I was fully intending to give this series a 2/10. I hated it to the point that I was actively looking for chores to do between each episode, but at least it was mercifully short\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Only fifteen minutes per episode\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and it had a pretty well acted Japanese dub. This is especially true of the gravely performance put forth by Yuji Oeda in the role of Krauzer\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 He only plays the Krauzer version, but he plays it very convincingly. Then something happened at the end of episode eleven that changed my mind. And since this show doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really have any plot or story to spoil, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to tell you exactly what it was.\n\nAfter a particularly racist stage show that painted the band\u00e2\u0080\u0099s manager as just barely competent enough to host a WWE show, we see a woman and her four year old child waiting in the lobby for her father as a group of fans point her out as a Mini-Krauzer. She starts belting out a DMC song that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s called An Anthem to Female Pigs(Or something like that), which is just a constant repeat of the phrase \u00e2\u0080\u009cI only need your lower half.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fair enough\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 This kind of thing could be funny. If it had stopped there.\n\nThe mother gives her daughter a bottle of milk, and the crowd proclaims excitedly that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drinking a white liquid. Oh, and before you start saying I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m getting too offended by a \u00e2\u0080\u0098child drinking something that looks like semen\u00e2\u0080\u0099 joke, just hold on, because it gets worse. Her father comes out of the bathroom, and the adorable little tot runs at him, jumping into her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arms, as the crowd cheers that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s raping him. And since they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re stupid enough to think that Krauzer was REALLY released from jail after murdering his parents just so he could make music, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no particular reason to say that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re joking about this. It beg the question of how they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d react if they were to stumble upon a real life crime as it were taking place. Would they cheer it on? Would they join in? Krauzer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s band is creating these people.\n\nWhile there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no dub for this series\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And I really can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t blame them\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The DVD has been released stateside by Sentai Filmworks, and I can only speculate that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re releasing a lot of undubbed DVDs because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re strapped for cash and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to spend the money on voice actors for the majority of their projects. Fair enough, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been through some hard times recently, and I can respect that decision. The DVD itself can be found for dirt cheap, with the average store price ranging somewhere around twenty dollars or so. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a translated manga from Viz Media, and while I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t read it, it can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t possibly be worse than the show.\n\nAnd it feels, to me at least, like my twenty dollars alone paid for their entire animation budget. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find anything about this show to be enjoyable\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not funny, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s terribly written, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s misogynistic down to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deepest core, and the in-show music was clearly written by somebody with no understanding of the genre they were supposed to be representing. The characters are awful, the situations are poorly thought out, the humor ranges from Baffling to Stomach-churning, and for a show that portrays itself as being realistic in design, the presence of the law is entirely inconsistent. Soichiro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deplorable behavior is not only excused and forgiven, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s often encouraged by infuriatingly positive outcomes. Even at fifteen minutes an episode, this show was a chore to sit through, and I feel dumber for having done so. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel as potentially dangerous as Popotan did, but it still stands right alongside it as one of the worst anime I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever watched. I give Detroit Metal City a 1/10. "}, {"id": 3229, "score": 40, "body": "\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis world is corrupt! In order to prevent further degeneration, the natural order must be put to right. And yet! Should the human race be unified under one rule, the ignorant masses would doubtlessly experience untold trouble adjusting to the new status quo. Revolution, though necessary, should not happen all at once, for such a thing would overwhelm the very problem it was created to solve. Nay, like the proverbial toad in hot water, the world must be conquered gradually, so the ideals of the future can have time to settle in the minds of the people. Thus, rather than aiming to conquer the entire world, or even an entire country, an act that would most assuredly be met with violent opposition and unflattering propaganda, a more prudent first step towards overall domination would be a much more reasonable goal\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The conquest of a single city! Yes, this far more modest approach will allow the population to acclimate to our presence, while also giving us some very lenient room for setback. Oh, and we also don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have much of a budget, so kindly see yourself to a part time job or something.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThese are more-or-less the words that greet new recruits of the highly ideological organization Across! While the majority of this organization remains shrouded in mystery, but we can at least indulge in some insight into the situation of the F City F Prefectural branch, which may or may not be the only one in existence, and is overseen by the ambitious and campy Lord Ilpalazzo, a man who rarely ever leaves his lofty throne while giving orders to his minions, the dysfunctional duo of Excel, a hyperactive zealot, and Hyatt, a demure beauty who would sooner spit blood on you than say hi to you. With their forces combined, along with a pet dog ans emergency food supply named Menchi, these two constant failures are at the forefront of the battle for city conquest, when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not battling to pay the rent and put food on the table, all while living right next door to the opposition that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trying to stop them. As the battle heats up between the forces of Across and a brigade of underpaid civil servants, whose side will you choose? Or rather, with all the wacky and nonsensical comedy going on, will you even bother to pick one?\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve probably talked about JC Staff the second most out of any other animation studios, right behind Studio Gainax, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made a habit of saying that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visual style is inconsistent. Well, inconsistent is the word of the day here, because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen them put out a bunch of different looking anime, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never seen anything else in their library that looked like Excel Saga. This is probably because they shared production duties with another Studio, namely Studio Shaft, and to call this an unholy union would be an understatement. Shaft has always been really weird visually, and when their sensibilities are combined with the animation of a company that can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to stay consistent from scene to scene, let alone from episode to episode, Excel saga is probably the strangest looking anime that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen. And to put that into context, I posted a review over three years ago of the series that ripped this one off, Panty and Stocking. At least in that show, the visual changes were intentional and artistic.\n\nThe animation quality here is indescribable. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good beyond words, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to say that I literally can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t describe it. I honestly can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even figure out what kind of budget it had, or how it managed said budget, because the level of quality goes up and down more often than your mom making the rent money. There are scenes that flow beautifully, with graceful animation and smooth movements, and then there are moments where movement becomes stilted and stiff, with long periods of talking heads periodically interrupted by bits of movement. There are two clip shows that obviously exist for budgetary purposes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Both of them even spend a lot of time recapping the same character arc! And then there are scenes where the action is happening so fast that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d swear it was going at a million frames per second. I can only assume the budget was so high that the studio, also high, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give a shit how it was used, and the clip episodes were done more so to make up for a lack of ideas than a lack of funds.\n\nThe characters whose images were bought to life in Koshi Rikdo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original manga have been given a massive cartoony upgrade\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Or downgrade, depending on the scene\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And while they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look too unrealistic, for the most part, they still look like anime caricatures of real people. These designs are mostly reflective of the original manga, but with the aforementioned cartoony upgrade presenting them as more polished and malleable, making them ideal for the anime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s screwball comedic style. The backgrounds, on the other hand, are much more stable and consistent, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been endowed with way more detail than they actually needed, as the director makes use of very short cuts. The lighting can at times remind you of an actual stage play, as even an episode taking place in a sewer can be more than bright and open enough for you to enjoy the action, without ruining the illusion of a claustrophobic environment. The set pieces are also incredibly diverse, as the characters venture out into an untold number of unpredictable locations, and they clearly had a lot of fun bringing them all to life.\n:\nThe music is just as bizarre as the visuals, but personally, I like it a lot better. I own a couple of CDs from this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soundtrack, and back when I had a car that had a CD player, I would often steal tracks from both of them if I felt like making an Instrumental mix. The music was produced by Victor Entertainment, and they get a much higher billing in the series than most music producers ever do. They totally deserve it, too, putting out a soundtrack full of instrumental and synthetic sound, which work both as standalone tunes and occasionally as parodies of the musical convention of other shows. A good example would be the bland, repetitive track it attached to a literal dating game, which was somehow able to sound good while still capturing the cringe of the harem genre. They forego the synthetic tunes completely in a later episode focusing on a rock star character, and it winds up sounding legitimately badass. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d keep going, naming off good tracks and why I like them, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably better to just say that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a really diverse, really weird soundtrack.\n\nThe opening, Love/Loyalty, is also one of my favorites. The song itself sounds like something from Michael Jackson, which isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t surprising if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen some of the director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other works. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sung by The Excel Girls, a fictitious band made up of two idol singers pretending to be members of Across(They appear as characters in the series, too), and they seem to have a lot of chemistry together. The video is basically what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d expect from an anime\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The main characters being shown in different situations, with the rest of the cast getting highlighted in brief shots, only it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done with that special brand of Excel Saga insanity. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skippable, but the ending theme isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. They being the dog character Menchi on screen to sing about how she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resigned herself to being eaten(In barks, while a woman translates), which is amazing in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own right, but then you have the dub, where they stuck a lot of jokes in the credits, some of them actually being funny.\n\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve forgotten the list I posted a few years ago of my top ten favorite English dubs, then let me get you up to speed: Excel Saga has one of the best dubs ever. Period. It was one of ADV\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempts to translate Japanese comedy for American audiences while still retaining the spirit of the original, and since Stephen Foster wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t involved at any point, they pulled it off beautifully. Every performance is either good in all the right ways or bad in all the right ways, with very little room for error\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 For the most part. It was, I believe, almost perfect, and if you know the series well, you pretty much know what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m referring to. Jessica Calvello, who disappeared from the business for nearly a decade before recently making a triumphant career resurgence, plays the title character of Excel, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to stake my reputation on the claim that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the single best performance in anime dubbing history. Her role was an extremely demanding one, but she still owned it, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d even argue that she did a better job than the original seiyuu.\n\nDue to the translation differences between the two languages, the English dialogue would often be a lot longer than the source, and instead of making changes to shorten it, Calvello just ran with it, talking way faster than her Japanese counterpart without ever diminishing the quality of her performance. Even during her most rapid speeches, you could feel how devoted she was to Ilpalazzo, how enthusiastically zealous she was for Across\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cause, and how little she cared for anything else. She could portray pain and suffering even better than Brittany Karbowski can, and get this, she even spoke with a perfect Kansai accent\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 well, as perfect as the English language can convey. She plays it like she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tried to get rid of it, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still kinda there, and it only comes out full force when she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shocked or emotionally overwhelmed. The amount of control she had over her voice was insane, and,well, it took it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s toll.\n\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve probably heard about this, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of a famous story in the industry, but Jessica Calvello put so much raw energy into this role, pushing herself so far beyond the limit, that she wound up injuring her throat, and had to be replaced by Larissa Wolcott halfway through the series, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a noticeable step down. Larissa didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do a bad job, or anything\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 To be fair, she did an admirable job matching the pace of Calvello\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance, and anybody who can motormouth like that deserves recognition for it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But she just didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the acting chops to measure up. It felt wrong. It was kinda like when Dan Castelanetta played the Genie\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yeah, he did a fine job, but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no Robin Williams. On a side note, Calvello also had a knack for Adlibbing that helped to Americanize the humor in some neat ways, which is probably why some of Excel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dialogue gets stranger after the switch. Thankfully, there were a bunch of other really good performances that we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to lose.\n\nIn addition to a handful of heavyweight voice acting veterans proving their ranges by playing an unbelievable number of characters\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Like John Swasey, Spike Spencer, Tiffany Grant and then-newcomer Kira Vincent Davis\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They even got great performances out of two of my least favorite voice actors, Mandy Clark and Mark Laskowski. Clark did an amazing job on the tragic pint-sized assassin Cossette Sara, and Laskowski\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knack for sounding stiff and hammy at the same time was a perfect fit for the goofball Iwata. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of fun hearing Chris Patton play a rock star, as he actually got to sing the translated songs, and he fucking nails each one. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a shame he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in Beck. Rob Mungle uses an over-the-top latino accent to play the immigrant Pedro, and while I was never a huge fan of that character/story arc, his commitment to the character was impressive. Brett Weaver was also impossible to ignore as Nabeshin, the parodic avatar of director Shinichi Watanabe, playing him as a kind of white Richard Roundtree(his words, not mine).\n\nRounding out the main cast, this anime was my introduction to Monica Rial, whose portrayal of Hyatt is probably one of the best in her repertoire. Taking a step up from her Seiyuu counterpart, she incorporates the character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anemia and weak constitution directly into her speech, as she perpetually sounds like she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on the verge of fainting. She also has no problem at all with all of Hyatt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just say her \u00e2\u0080\u0098bodily malfunctions.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Jason Douglas takes the flat-voiced, one note character of Ilpalazzo and seems to channel Maximilian Pegasus to create a more foppish, melodramatic shine that the character was so sorely missing. They really didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any need to redub the character of Menchi, as she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a freaking dog whose only lines consist of dog noises, and they could have easily just kept the Japanese performance like Pokemon did with Pikachu, but they cast Hilary Haag anyway, and her dog noises are almost as funny as Luci Christian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s duck noises. Even if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a hardcore sub fan, this is one exception I highly recommend you make.\n\nIf the name Shinichi Watanabe means nothing to you, it means you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never seen one of his anime. If you had, trust me, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d know it. Watanabe, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cNabeshin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also known, is something of an auteur, as his work generally has a distinct style and personality to it that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s directly reflective of his influence on it. This can be a good thing or a bad thing, as any follower of Akiyuki Shinbou or Hayao Miyazaki will tell you, and for Nabeshin, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of both. He often gets praised for his work in the genre of anime comedy, as well as for his flare for satire and genre parody, and the results have been\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, mixed. His work tends to consist of lightning fast pacing, rapidfire jokes, and constant references to other anime, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty much Excel Saga in a nutshell. Granted, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worked as episodic and storyboarding director for a lot of other peoples\u00e2\u0080\u0099 projects, but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taken on very few himself, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easier with him than it is with most directors to examine what it is that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all about.\n\nHis work, particularly in reference to Excel Saga, has garnered a reputation for being insane and random, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s here that I feel I have to disagree. The Excel Saga anime is not the work of a madman, or an unhinged mind. The writing on this show is in fact very calculated. With examples of genuine insanity and randomness out there, like FLCL and Rejected, Excel Saga skews closer to one of those focus-group facades of insanity and randomness, like (and I am so sorry, but you know it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true) Invader Zim, but with an extra bit of conceit and arrogance hiding behind it. Nabeshin took the premise and characters of the manga, saw how offbeat it all was, and used it as an excuse to just not give a fuck. Yes, Excel Saga is one giant bag of fucks not being given, and by God does it show. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so easy just to write whatever you want, make fun of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s popular, and do constant pop culture references\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why Family Guy does it. Excel Saga is, at it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core, the true anime version of Family Guy. Moreso than Lucky Star will ever be.\n\nAnd for those of you getting annoyed at me for interpreting the intentions of a creator that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never met before, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not just talking out of my ass on this. I know that the anime wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a product of actual insanity or inspiration, because I know what those things look like in a narrative\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I have, after all, read the original manga. The Excel Saga manga, created by Koshi Rikdo in the 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, is an example of what true insanity looks like\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not unhinged and disconnected ramblings of randomness, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a genuinely batshit narrative that reads like it made perfect sense to the person writing it. Yeah, it looks bonkers from the outside looking in, but it still gives off a sense of consistence and intention. It was a grand, sweeping epic with foreshadowing, themes, depth, smart callbacks and meticulous attention to detail. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like if Lord of the Rings were written by a mental patient. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how Rikdo actually feels about Nabeshin getting all the popular credit for his work, I mean he DID take a couple of ideas from the anime long after the fact, but I still don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t picture him looking upon it fondly.\n\nOne of the biggest downsides to this is in terms of characterizations. Nabeshin didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just bastardize the original concept, he also turned almost the entire cast into one-note jokes and shallow gimmicks. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost no character development in the entire series, outside of a few plot-specific changes and a few early actions taken from the manga. Aside from these, their actions are largely interchangeable. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a whole lot I can say about that, as I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really want to give away too many spoilers about either entity(especially the manga), but there is one character I might be able to offer up\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The fourth Civil Servant and later Municipal Force member, Misaki Matsuya. She starts out in the manga as a bit of a tsundere, spurning the annoying advances of Iwata, and in the anime, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basically where she stays\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 A violent and ultra-capable stick in the mud with stilted speech patterns and a no-nonsense demeanor. She even legitimately tries to kill Iwata in one episode, but can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t because her gun misfires.\n\nIn the manga, however, she gets a lot more development, and feels a lot more like an actual person. She becomes friends with her teammates, and shows at least enough compassion towards Iwata to care whether he lives or dies. Did you know she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a hardcore gamer in her free time, and that she wanders over to her coworkers apartments to hang out if she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feeling goofy from losing sleep to a gaming session? Did you know she forms a bond with computer geek Sumiyoshi by helping him to test out his elaborate computer set-ups? Did you know that when their boss Kabapu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plans get out of hand, she actually attempts to leave the country to avoid getting dragged into them? No, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know any of that, because Nabeshin did jack shit with her character. And she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a special case, either. Every single character in this series has expansive development that far outshines anything they did in the anime, and yes, I mean literally every character, from the pedophile scientist to the ill-fated dog Menchi. If I told you what was supposed to happen to Iwata down the road, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d seriously think I was fucking with you.\n\nAnd I know it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tacky to judge an anime by comparing it to the original manga, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not doing this to condemn it for being inaccurate, but as a device to show you just how lazy it is. Yes, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right, the Excel Saga anime isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t crazy, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lazy. It takes what it needs to from the manga, and then just puts no effort into anything that it did with it. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get me wrong, the music and animation clearly had a lot of love put into them, but in terms of writing and story-telling, and especially with the comedy, Nabeshin just did the easiest things he could at every turn. Breaking the fourth wall is easy. Random gag humor is easy. Parody, or at least Nabeshin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brand of it, is easy. Justifying your show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s problems by having characters complain about them, and having meta characters talk about the production, is taking the easy way out. Having your Lupin-inspired stand-in complain about the lack of story and plot doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t create a story or plot. You can only wring so much of an excuse out of calling your show \u00e2\u0080\u009cExperimental\u00e2\u0080\u009d before people start to wonder what substance you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re actually experimenting with.\n\nAnd I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just shut up and turn off my brain, and enjoy it as a goofy comedy, because about 90% of the time, I just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find it funny. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard people refer to it as satire\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Are you kidding me? Satire has a point. Satire has logic. Satire has intentions. There is no satire in this show. The closest it gets to satire is picking a vague genre, blatantly calling out what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong with it, exaggerating a few cliches and then just adding some weird shit like monkeys to the mix. The very idea of an existing internal logic is completely absent. If there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s any satire in it, and if any of the comedy in it is smart in some way, then it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s buried under culturally impenetrable Japanese references. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a rule in comedy that if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to do a reference joke, it has to work as both a reference and a joke, so that people who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get the reference can still enjoy the joke. I first saw this series almost fifteen years ago, and I still don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen a quarter of the anime I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have to in order to fully enjoy the experience.\n\nExcel Saga was originally available from ADV Films, but after they went under, this property was one of the many they wound up selling off. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s currently available from Funimation, and while the form they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve released it in isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as visually impressive as its\u00e2\u0080\u0099 previous forms, it is more affordable and easier to obtain. The original manga by Koshi Rikdo is available stateside from Viz, and while a couple of volumes were impossible to find a few years back, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all readily available nowadays for some decent prices. An extra episode called Going too Far serves kind oif as the true ending of the series, and it can be found on most DVD sets. A spin-off series called Puni Puni Poemy is also available, and it actually IS genuinely insane.\n\nI feel like the reason Excel Saga is looked upon so fondly is because people generally haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t read much of the manga. This is also probably why Nabeshin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s adaptation of Hayate the Combat Butler wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as well received, because people actually cared about that manga. As for me, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not gonna lie and pretend that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good show, but I do I have a soft spot for it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mostly because of the dub, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also because it was one of my formative anime. When I decided to venture beyond what was available on TV, this was one of the manga that my local library introduced me to, along with Love Hina, Chobits, and Azumanga Daioh. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t out and out hate it, but I do consider it to be something of a guilty pleasure, like how I occasionally might get bored, fire up Netflix and watch a Family Guy episode. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crap, but once in a while, crap is comforting. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some good here, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all taken from the manga, and NOT a product of mad genius from the talentless hack who directed it. I give Excel Saga a 4/10. "}, {"id": 3233, "score": 10, "body": "-Minor spoilers\n\nHarumi Kazuhito isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t your ordinary bookworm. His entire life revolves around books. I know that may sound like hyperbole, but oh no, I mean that with complete sincerity. I also mean it literally, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to that. For now, Harumi is a high school boy who has dedicated his life to the pastime of reading. He basically chain-reads, buying up books by the handfuls, burning through them at supernatural speeds, and hoarding every volume he finishes. He even refused to live with his family, opting instead to live in an apartment by himself so he could go to school in an area where the books he wants are able to come out slightly quicker. One day, while he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reading in a cafe, a crazed robber bursts in and begins to wave a shotgun around. He threatens a young woman who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s distractedly writing away in another seat, and Harumi gets up to defend her\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Not because he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s generally a nice person, but because he can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand to see a fellow book-lover get hurt. Yes, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how his mind works\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Or, how it DID work, until the robber blew it out of his skull.\n\nNow freshly dead, Harumi decides he can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cross over to the land of the dead yet\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 He has so many books he still wants to read, including the final book from his favorite author, Akiyama Shinobu. He manages to pull himself back to the land of the living with the strength of this passion\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 So, like I said, his life literally revolves around books\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But through some mix-up, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reincarnated into the body of a dog. A miniature dachshund, to be exact, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kept in a small cage in a pet store even though he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not for sale(this is never explained). He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soon adopted by the girl he rescued, as the connection they share has given her the ability to hear his thoughts(at least I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the reason?), and she takes him home\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 To murder him. Until he finds out she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really Akiyama Shinobu, she finds out he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fan of her work, and she inexplicably becomes sexually attracted to him. And as it turns out, these are not going to be the only extreme oddities in his life going forward, as the world around him just gets weirder and weirder. Good god, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just get this turkey over with already.\n\nStudio Gonzo may have some acclaimed titles under their belt, what with the Fullmetal Panic franchise and arguably Linkin Park\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best music video having been produced by them, but when you tally their output together, the bad far outweighs the good. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve put out some visual wonders like Gankutsuou, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also let out some real clunkers like Gantz, and while Dog and Scissors, may not be THAT far down the ladder, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty close to the bottom. The animation is stiff and cheap in a way that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s honestly hard not to notice. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re clearly able to save a lot of money with the fact that the central character, living in the body of a dog, is able to speak telepathically, without the burden of having to animate lip flaps, so all they have to do is repeat animation cycles when he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on screen\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Be it slight movements in his fur, or wagging the tuft of hair on his head\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But this advantage becomes stale very fast, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a variation on the talking heads that make up the rest of the cast.\n\nAnd speaking of the cast, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be honest, the character designs look pretty good. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just looking at still images, the series actually looks really crisp and pleasing to the eye. A few of the designs look a bit cliched, and they all look a bit standard, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all pleasant to look at. Harumi makes for an adorable little doggy(which makes up for how intentionally bland he looks as a human), and maybe this is a matter of personal taste, but I love the design of his chop-happy new owner Natsuno. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like a grown-up version of Ai Enma who walks around dressed up like an extra from the Matrix movies, and I dig it, she looks really cool. I also really like the afro guy who runs the pet store. not only does his apron feature a clever Jojo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bizarre Adventure easter egg, he just looks like he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be a really chill dude to hang out with. The backgrounds are also immaculately detailed, with shelves full of diverse looking books giving our characters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 collections their own sense of personality, and each character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s living space is detailed enough to add a new dimension to their personalities, especially in the case of Natsuno.\n\nOf course, that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t excuse the animation. Despite what the premise may have suggested, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s action in this series, but considering how well it moves, you may as well just read the damn light novels. The only thing that looks like it had any real money put into it was the opening, which is fast moving, full of visual effects, and actually manages to translate the characters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 awkward movements into some really fun dance cycles. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve probably seen an anime where characters imitate dogs or cats by moving their half-clenched fists in a certain way to resemble paws, haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you? This opening features nearly the entire cast doing step-dances that heavily incorporate that kind of movement, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so adorable you just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but smile when seeing it. They also have doggy ears and tails, and as a possible result of the video\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fast pace, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disquietingly easy to not notice this the first time watching it. This video has no right to be as fun as it is, but at least it was SOMETHING to look forward to.\n\nOf course, it probably helps that the song was also really catchy. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s by Inu Musume Club, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s called \u00e2\u0080\u009cWan Wan Wan Wan N_1,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that may sound like gibberish at first glance, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a really popular Japanese pun behind it. Wan is the Japanese onomatopoeia for the sound a dog makes, which any American would call Woof or Bark. Wan also sounds like One, hence why the title begins with barking and ends with an obvious abbreviation for Number One. This actually isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even the only opening theme to employ this pun, hell, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not even the best one, as Working!!! actually did it much better, but leaving that aside, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a funny little footnote. The ending theme is almost as delightful as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s op counterpart, with Natsuno flying a scissors-inspired private jet, her rival\u00e2\u0080\u0099s black-suited bodyguards expressionlessly dancing in tandem, and generally just a bunch of creative and funny imagery gets paired to a slightly more low-key but still catchy song with the bizarre name Lemonade scandal.\n\nI wish I could tell you more about the music, but unfortunately, I barely noticed it at all during the show. I guess that means it was doing it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job? I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember ever hating the music\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 At least not as much as generally everything else\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And I can vaguely recall tapping my foot to a few fun-sounding tunes. This is normally where I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be looking up each individual track online, but I can only find one, by the name of Mieta Kibo, and god help me, it sounds absolutely divine. I guess that shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be a surprise, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s credited to one Akito Matsuda, who Wikipedia says WAS in charge of the music of the series, but since there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only one track available online, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have to rewatch the show to hear it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ost\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather stick a thumb-tack through my eyelid. Thankfully, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done the soundtracks to a lot of other recent anime, and now that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m hearing some of it, I suddenly REALLY want to watch Sound Euphorium. His composition, as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard, was the one and only interesting thing about Glasslip, so Dog and Scissors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 music was probably just as solid.\n\nThe English dub is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weird, but hey, this is a weird show. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a mix of bizarrely enthusiastic standouts and adequate, okay performances, with thankfully no real duds to speak of. At the very worst, some of the casting choices are standard, just the actors we know coming and doing their thing, catching an easy paycheck off of a role that they were suited for. Chief among these is Blake Shepard, who I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m normally not a huge fan of, playing the lead role of Harumi, and while his delivery skews the line between hammy and wooden whenever his character is excited, he manages to nail it whenever he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supposed to sound serious or sarcastic. And then on the other end of the spectrum you have Jessica Calvello, an actor who\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, if you assign her to one of your characters, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pretty much bringing out the big guns, because putting her in any role but the lead is fucking overkill. Luckily, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s playing one half of the titular pair here, and her penchant for hitting a wide range within one single character adds a level of insanity that makes Natsuno far more tolerable than her disturbingly subtle Japanese portrayal.\n\nThere are other actors, of course, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to bring up Luci Christian as a highlight because she put an absurd amount of effort into a suicidal self-blaming character\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And the adaptive script is really good at localizing the dialogue without straying too far from the original intent, although it does fuck up once towards the end and make i sound like someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s responding to Harumi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thought-comments\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But I really want to skip right to the second half of this review, because I have a lot to say about the writing and meat of this anime, and none of it is pleasant. So let me just say that the dub is good, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d highly recommend it over the sub, because the sub just sounds too grounded, which makes a lot of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more problematic elements harder to stomach. The dub gives it more of a wacky and bizarre personality, allowing you to mentally remove it from the harsher implications of a lot of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so-called jokes. Then again maybe that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just me being dumb American and not appreciating the Japanese language or whatever. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to watch this, I recommend doing it in English.\n\nRight, now that that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s over with, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been holding this in for far too long. If I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t already given this away, Dog and Scissors is bad. Like, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really, really bad. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not funny bad\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not interesting bad\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the kind of bad that I only place among the worst of the worst, which, for me, is a list that not even School Days has been able to crack. I actually hesitated to write this review, and even thought about stopping a few times, because I honestly don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think a review is necessary. This is the kind of show where you can immediately tell whether or not it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth watching\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yeah, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ironic that an anime revolving around books would be so easy to judge from a glance at the cover. In fact, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all you really need to know to get a feel for the series: A woman adopts a puppy because she wants to kill it, and then spares it because she wants to have sex with it. I know that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not entirely fair, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taking the scenario out of context, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not inaccurate, either. That literally happens, and further details don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do much to improve things.\n\nEverything about this series\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, aside from the music, dub and art\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Is either stupid, confusing or awful. There is not one redeeming quality outside of those few production efforts. I could do an entire Inconvenient Questions post about each individual episode, but I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, because watching this show twice in my life was twice too many times, and I cancelled IQ for a good reason. Thus, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m only going to focus on my biggest problems with this series. For starters, I failed to mention until now what the biggest connection between Natsuno and Harumi is. He can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk, being a dog, but she can hear his thoughts. This might not bother you, but it bugs the hell out of me\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 His thoughts aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t treated like thoughts, but like regular conversation. She hears him as though he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speaking. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not how thinking works. You never stop thinking. And yeah, you could SAY that she can only hear thoughts he sends to her, but this also isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t true, because the only reason they met is because his thoughts, from elsewhere in the city, were distracting her, and she tracked him down.\n\nRight there, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s established that not only can she hear his thoughts without his consent or knowledge, but that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a long range, and she can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shut it out, but there are possibly thousands of instances in the series that directly contradict this. Why does she ask him questions? Why does she ever think he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lying about something? You can hear his thoughts! He shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to lie to you! Why do you each read a book at the same time, when you should just be able to hear him reading it? Did his thoughts distracting you from writing just stop? Did that problem go away the second you decided to not murder him? If you were able to track him down to the pet store he was being kept in(like a parrot), why do you EVER have to look for him in order to find him? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry, I really am, but this entire premise is so frustratingly inconsistent that I honestly found it distracting throughout the series. Even comedies\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 No, especially comedies\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Have to take themselves seriously to enough of a degree that they pay attention to fucking detail.\n\nOh, and speaking of comedy, have you noticed how small Natsuno\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breasts are? Good, because I just spoiled at least 60% of this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comedy. The other 40% is largely made up of BDSM and animal cruelty. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like speaking in absolutes, but I have to say this: In anime, jokes about a female character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bust size are never, ever funny. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not saying that because such humor is sexist, or mean-spirited\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 although they are both of those things\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m saying it because that is THE most overused joke in anime history. Characters bringing up cup sizes happens more often than tsunderes over-reacting to misunderstandings, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s saying something. The only time I can ever remember a boob-size joke being funny was in Yamada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s First Time, when Yamada was imagining what her best friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life must be like with big boobs, getting all jealous, but then we get a glimpse of said friend having to apply lotion to herself because of how much the damn things chafe. See, that was a clever subversion of expectations, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an example of how hard a boob-size joke has to work to even be kind of funny.\n\nDog and Scissors relies heavily on this idea, but it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put anywhere near that level of effort into it. Despite the fact that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not into real live women, Harumi is constantly berating Natsuno on her bust, and even when he isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s constantly seen obsessing over it. It gets to the point where I was seriously wondering why Natsuno didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just get a damn boob job already. Yeah, I know I shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t promote a shallow image of beauty, and people look fine just as they are, but plastic surgery can help people who have confidence issues relating to their appearances. Natsuno\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a grown woman, she makes her own decisions, she lives independently off of her success, and she clearly has Seto Kaiba levels of disposable income lying around, so why doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t she just get some work done? Oh, right, because that would take away the one lazy-ass joke that this series keeps on dragging out of the dumpster to try and amuse us, to the point that even a dead horse would tell them to stop beating a dead horse.\n\nAnd speaking of Natsuno, try to wrap your head around this; She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s twenty years old, hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t written anything since she was 19, and is implied to have a bibliography that would make Stephen King jealous. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s written a ton of novels spanning all types of genres, and at least six of her books are thick enough to contain at least a few thousand pages each. By the time she was 19. Not only is she considered one of the three top best-selling authors(the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn Japan\u00e2\u0080\u009d is never attached to this, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fair to say they mean worldwide), but the other two, who we meet in this series, are also young ladies of a similar age. Hell, her most vocal rival spends most of her time as a pop idol! The world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best selling authors are seriously three teenagers?  Did any thought go into any of this?  Even her threats to kill Harumi don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t add up to anything, as all she ever does is cut off portions of his fur, which grow back in less than five seconds\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And yet he still acts terrified of her, every single time she attacks him. Hey, dumbass, she may say she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to cut off one of your ears, but I think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re gonna be fine.\n\nAnd honestly, even it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focus on books and reading was completely shallow. All Dog and Scissors knows is that reading and writing are things. Possibly fun things. Possibly lucrative things. It knows they exist, it knows they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re important to people, but it has no deeper understanding of any of it. Not only do we never find out anything about Natsuno\u00e2\u0080\u0099s books outside of their titles and a seven deadly sins gimmick, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even technically know if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re fiction or non. Harumi is extremely pretentious, being that he loves to read, he deifies books, he defends books from critics, he judges people(even his own damn murderer) on whether or not they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re readers, and get this; He has no defined taste. This moron would probably get his jollies off reading the ingredients on a packet of McDonalds ketchup. This series knows as much about books as Adam Sandler knows about video games. We never find out what literature means to anybody, but it wears it on it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s damn sleeve.\n\nAnd if any of you are holding out hope that the plot and mystery aspect might have something to offer, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Harumi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s killer is found and dealt with so early that it can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even be considered a spoiler. It turns out that after killing him, the killer had time to rob him before running away, and has been hiding in the second apartment that Harumi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been keeping secret from his family AND his landlady. Chew on that for a moment. They find him, they chase him down, and it turns out he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got Natsuno\u00e2\u0080\u0099s six thickest books hiding in his coat(even though they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d definitely be weighing him down and banging into his body while he was running), and he uses them as weapons in the worst anime fight scene since Master of Martial Hearts. She beats him, and gives Harumi the choice to either kill or spare him, all while I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m screaming \u00e2\u0080\u009cNeither! Call the fucking cops!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Oh, and we never meet his parents, we hear nothing of any funeral, he has no drive to get his life back, and we meet his sister, but\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Hoboy. Had to dip into the incest shit, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you? Bottom of the barrel wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t low enough?\n\nDog and Scissors is available on both DVD and Bluray from Sentai Filmworks, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s available both in dubbed and undubbed formats. The manga and light novel are not available stateside.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not gonna lie, guys, this was a tough one to get through. The only reason I even bothered is because I was on hiatus for a few months, and I needed something especially bad to rage on. Thus, I figured, why not an anime where one of the biggest running jokes is the main character commenting about shit not making sense, while completely missing the bigger picture each time? Like I said before, the artwork and character designs are good, the music is serviceable and the opening and closing themes are awesome, but these are really the only things it has going for it, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the only qualities that pull it up from a possible 0 score, and I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even scratched the surface of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong with it. It falls apart if you give it even one seconds worth of thought, which is why I have to wonder if the people who enjoy and defend it checked their brains at the door, or at birth. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t condone threatening violence against dogs with a pair of scissors, but this is one tail that definitely should have been cut short. I give Dog & Scissors a 1/10."}, {"id": 3237, "score": 40, "body": "The Lifestream is the name we call the living flow of energy that courses throughout the planet. It flows through every living thing, from the tiniest ant to the tallest tree, and even through people like you and me. When a person is born, they come from the Lifestream\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And when people die, their souls return to it. Unfortunately, as it turns out, the Lifestream can also be harvested. The Shinra Company, the people who first discovered this, found a way to convert it into Mako energy. It powered our technology, lit our lights, and made our lives comfortable, but at a heinous price\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The planet only had a finite amount of Lifestream to offer, and we were draining it dry, slowly killing it for our own benefit. Fearing for the future of humanity, a small group of heroes banded together to stand up to Shinra, which inadvertently drew them into a much larger conflict involving Shinra\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shadier practices\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 A former soldier, Sephiroth, the unholy result of an infusion of both Mako and the cells of an ancient alien, soon entered the conflict.\n\nThe battles they waged, the journey they endured, and the consequences they faced would become the material of legend\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But in the end, it was the planet itself that saved us from extinction, stopping the advance of a giant meteor mere inches before it could make contact with the ground. Maybe it was their failure that angered it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Maybe it was our arrogance. Maybe it was the fact that our so-called heroes actually stopped Shinra from trying to destroy the meteor to save us. Whatever the reason, a new disease was born shortly after their story ended\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s called Geostigma, and while it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exact nature is unclear, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s related in some genetic way to the ancient alien, Jenova. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claimed many lives so far\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Men, women, and children have been wasting away while this strange flesh consuming disease spread across their bodies faster than any illness ever known to us. The future of our species, once believed to be saved, is more uncertain than it ever has been. With new threats coming seemingly out of nowhere, will our heroes, now scattered to the wind, be able to unite in time to stop the revival of Sephiroth and cure Geostigma? Or is the time of man truly coming to an end?\n\nUnlike most anime, this movie wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually made by any known anime production company\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It was animated by Square Enix, the owners of the Final Fantasy games, which of course get more and more visually impressive with each release(over-all quality notwithstanding). It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also probably the best looking CG anime I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen, which wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be saying much if it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for the fact that it was animated in 2005, and even the most recent CG anime releases\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 such as Oblivion Island and Knights of Sidonia\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Look like creepy, frozen-faced marionette garbage. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really easy to attribute visual quality in animation to budget, but then you have to look at films like the Berserk Golden Age Trilogy, which had gobs of money to spare, but was so poorly directed that they almost appeared to be over-animated. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know off-hand whether or not Advent Children had a budget that was comparable to the Berserk movies, but it looks infinitely better. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s insane to think this movie is twelve years old, with just how wonderfully articulate and expressive the character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s faces are. They even look believably Japanese, a surprising rarity in the anime medium.\n\nThe film\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visual quality gets even more impressive when you remove the comparison to the anime medium, however, because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not even kidding when I say that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visual production quality puts Pixar to shame. Remember Wall-E, the movie where a little robot roams all alone through a deserted planet full of garbage and debris? The ruins of Midgar alone take this idea to an extreme, as you can make out each and every piece of garbage and twisted scrap metal in stunning detail, sometimes even in shots that only last a few seconds. Every single piece of fabric moves accurately in regard to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s make-up, from wool to leather, the framing is nothing short of professional, and this is probably the only animated entity I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen where everybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hair looks and moves like actual hair. Considering how the popular company Rooster Teeth has huge problems with character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hair clipping into them, and even Disney has to simplify hair design just to make ends meet, this is one aspect of animation where Advent Children is ahead of a time that hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even happened yet. The backgrounds and depth of field are breath taking, the combat is fast and easy to follow(at least in the Complete edition), and the characters move so fluidly that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not hard to forget you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching motion capture and not real people. Even Rogue One, a movie released a few short months ago, had trouble making CG people look this good.\n\nAs for the music, do I even have to say anything? Advent Children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s music was composed by the same man who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name was attached to every Final Fantasy game so far save for Thirteen, with many of the tracks from the original seventh game brought back, some of which have been given kick-ass theatrical enhancements. Yeah, Nobuo Uematsu accomplished a lot under the heavy limits of video game soundtracks at the time FF7 came out, but with a full orchestra at his disposal, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but imagine that the tunes in this movie were what was going through his mind when he was composing the original, simpler versions. If nothing else, this movie is worth watching just for the new and enhanced versions of One Winged Angel and J-E-N-O-V-A. Several older tunes like the Main Theme, Tifa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Theme and the immortal Aerith\u00e2\u0080\u0099s theme have been brought back in a more respectful manner, which they deserve, with their only real changes being in pace and instrumentation. Several new tracks have also been created, and while pretty much all of it is awesome enough to listen to both in and out of context, a few stand-outs include For the Reunion, Divinity II, Those Who Fight Further, and Black Water.\n\nAs for the English dub\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Ho boy, I may have to dilly dally on this one. See what I did there? Sorry. Well, I guess I should start on a positive note, Reno\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interpretation is outstanding. They hired Quentin Flynn for the role, which was probably a spot of type casting thanks to his previous ginger character, Axl from Kingdom Hearts. He plays the star of the Turks as a cocky goofball, and a well-meaning screw-up with ironic charm to spare. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure if this counts as a spoiler, because everybody knows going in that this character was going to show up sooner or later, but Sephiroth is also really well done, as George Newbern plays him from the perspective of the only character he ever interacts with, Cloud. This calls for him to be calm and condescending, with a flow of diabolic affection that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just barely contained by his assured demeanor, and George nails it, while Lance Bass sits in a corner somewhere feeling lonely and unloved. I wish I could say anything as positive about Crispin Freeman, but the undisputed God of deep voices goes wasted in the role of Rude, whose knack for saying very little has carried over from the game.\n\nThere are a couple of other performances that are decent, such as Steve Blum as Vincent and Steve Staley as Kadaj, and the child actors are surprisingly okay, but everyone else is crap. I really wanna be nice to Steve Burton and Rachel Leigh Cook and say that they could have been good if their roles as the main characters Cloud and Tifa hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been written so terribly, and it should have taken far, far better actors to play them as more than just a whiny emo and a nagging fishwife, but even taking those circumstances into account, it just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sound like either of them brought their A-Game. Cook just sounds confused by the incoherent lines of love interest dialogue she was given, which is kind of fair considering how badly translated a lot of her material was, and Burton just sounds like he found one particular pitch to speak from and started holding onto it as a safe place that he never strayed too far from. Also, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m probably the only person who actually liked Mandy Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance as Aerith in Kingdom Hearts 1, and the woman they replaced her with\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Mena Suvari\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Is just as terrible here as she was in Kingdom Hearts 2. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like she had a difficult role, either.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure whether to blame writing or acting for the rest of the problems, like Beau Billingslea quoting Mr. T in the role of Barret, Greg Ellis playing Cait Sith with a Scottish accent, or Wally Wingert playing Rufus Shinra like he just got a fresh enema, but holy crap, Christy Carlson Romano is horrible as Yuffie. What happened there? She was outstanding as Kim Possible, and was even impressive playing this same character in the Kingdom Hearts games. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to have to call out the writing and translation team once again, because the way this dub is written is just bafflingly terrible. It sounds like human speech for the most part, but the awkward pauses the characters make when delivering their lines to try and match the lip flaps look nowhere near natural. Several lines were changed from the original DVD release in the complete edition, but being the geniuses that they are, they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change the three\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Count them, three\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Utterances of the phrase \u00e2\u0080\u009cDilly-Dally, Shilly-Shally,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which is a phrase so widely maligned that people won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even make a meme out of it, even though pretty much anyone who hears it instantly remembers exactly where it came from. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend the sub over the dub, but if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m being completely honest, only the original release had the original Japanese dialogue included in a subtitle track, and the tracks in the complete edition are just word for word transcriptions of the dub. Well, at least the Japanese version isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as bad with the lip-synching.\n\nThere are spoilers beyond this point, for both the game and the movie.\n\nNow, before I start talking about whether or not this film works, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to have to discuss what it was about the original game that worked so well, because in the end, the game is what this movie was trying to be\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It was trying to capture lightning in a bottle all over again with a retread of one of the most successful game in history. A lot of people call Final Fantasy 7 needlessly complicated, incoherent and full of emo pandering, but you know what? I call bullshit on all charges. Sure, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking at the big picture all at once, Final Fantasy 7 can appear to be uninviting and poorly thought out, but when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re actually playing it, experiencing it beat for beat with patience and a lot of time to spare, this game had a surprisingly simple story that never piled on too much information at once and never really needed to give you time to catch up with it. Sure, there were a few things that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make sense until really far in, and understanding the history of Jenova and the Cetra takes way too much outside studying and Al Bhed usage, but the information you WERE given was smartly executed.\n\nThe story and plot were also very generously paced, particularly in regard to the world-building, the nature of the planet Gaia, and Cloud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character arc. Yeah, I know he has a reputation for being emo, but that was actually a very small part of his journey. He started out the game as kind of a cocky asshole, but over time\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Especially after meeting Aerith\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 He grew and opened up, connecting with his new friends and finding a strength he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know he had. He eventually spiraled into depression when he realized that the very memories that gave him confidence were all lies, but he came out of it, replacing the false strength that pushed people away with a new strength that drew them closer, turning him into a true leader and, ironically, a true Soldier. You didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to know very much about Sephiroth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s origins, Jenova\u00e2\u0080\u0099s origins or the Cetra to know exactly where you were supposed to be or what your next objective was, which was all you, Cloud, needed to know at any given time.\n\nI haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t experienced all of the different sequels, prequels and spin-offs of this game, but one thing the ones I have been through all have in common is that they break away from Cloud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story, expanding on details that never needed to be expanded upon, like Zack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s backstory and the history of Jenova, elements that had originally stayed peacefully in the background, but now with more attention on them, they expose more and more inconsistencies and incoherent details that probably should have stayed buried under the story of the silent protagonist. This game never needed an expanded lore, and now that it has one, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just become over-complicated. Advent Children focuses on the story of Cloud, which is generally the right way to go, but their version of what made the game work so well seems to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmo hero fighting white-haired bishie villain over top of an environmental message.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They delivered on that premise, which is unfortunate, because the game ended in such a way that none of that really sounds viable for a sequel. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry, but it really isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\n\nSo how did they start the movie with an emo Cloud, after all the development that he went through in the game? They decided to focus on an aspect of Cloud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character that the game never did; They made him feel guilty about letting Aerith die. Yes, when we meet Cloud, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s retreated from most human contact, taken a job as a delivery boy, and refuses to help anyone because he failed to do so\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Once. There are several reasons this doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work, the first one being that newcomers to the franchise have no idea who Aerith even is, let alone what she means to Cloud and how she died. Even veterans will likely not care, as Aerith\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death is one of the most relentlessly over-exposed moments in Final Fantasy history, and oh yeah, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one other thing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Cloud never blamed himself for her death. In the game, he blamed Sephiroth, and he understood what her sacrifice was. Any regret he had over it was defined by the reveal that he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a real soldier, and that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not as capable as he thought he was. So the first selling point of this movie falls flat, because a brooding self-hating Cloud is a false Cloud who can only exist by retconning all of his upwards development.\n\nBut what about Sephiroth? You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make a Final Fantasy 7 movie without the most iconic villain in video game history, can you? But bringing him back abruptly would just feel like a cheap ass-pull. Advent children decides to have it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cake and eat it too by saving Sephiroth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revival for the climax of the movie, giving it the necessary build-up, but satiating the fans by giving Cloud three NEW androgynous white-haired villains to fight\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Sephiroth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clones, Huey, Dewey and Louis. Yes, I know that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not their real names, but I refuse to spend this entire review typing out the name \u00e2\u0080\u009cYazoo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some depth to these characters, as they respectively represent Sephiroth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ambition, strength and charm, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pretty cool in a fight, but everything else about them is confusing and convoluted. Where did they come from? Did Hojo create them? Were they ordinary babies splashed with Mako, like the ooze and the Ninja Turtles? How do they know about Cloud? How do they even know about Sephiroth? And then you have their plan\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Give me a minute.\n\nSo, their plan is to find Jenova\u00e2\u0080\u0099s severed head, but the Turks get to it first. How did either side find it? Nobody knows. They can apparently track her to the middle of nowhere, but can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell when she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s three feet in front of them. They follow the Shinra to Midgar, and decide the head must be hidden under a huge monument to the people lost two years ago, even though the timelines aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even remotely close. They kidnap children, take them to a mystic land of white trees, and brainwash them to be servants\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Why? So they can stand in a very loose circle around the monument while Dewey and Louis search in broad daylight. Hell, the kids attract more attention to them than waiting until night and searching in silence would have, and this wide child-gate doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even keep out Rude and Reno. Would using Cloud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stolen materia to summon Bahamut to search the monument at night have been smarter? Yes, yes it would.\n\nThey tried to implement depth by exploring the theme of forgiveness, but since Cloud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quest to have a dead girl and himself both extend him the olive branch feels untrue and hollow, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s explore the more important forgiveness-seekers, The Turks. After all, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s their drive to be forgiven by the world that sets the plot in motion, right? Hell no. First of all, what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for is vindication, proof that they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cause the geostigma outbreak. What they should be asking forgiveness for is murdering millions of people by collapsing Sector seven, but that horrible, depraved act isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually mentioned in this film outside of a Blu-Ray only look at Denzel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s backstory in a special feature. But speaking of Denzel, and leaving the \u00e2\u0080\u0098theme of forgiveness\u00e2\u0080\u0099 crap behind, this is one of the few things about the movie that kind of works\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The Geostigma.\n\nIn the Complete Edition, you finally get the full lowdown on what this outbreak really is, since it was all cut from the original DVD for time and pacing. I think. After the planet saved humanity from Meteor, the Lifestream somehow became mixed with Jenova cells, thus resulting in the spread of her genetic material to millions of people. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a disease that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s killing millions, and it acts very nicely as a ticking time bomb for the movie, as well as an excuse to show Cloud hallucinating about Aerith. Sure, there are a FEW hiccups in the plotline, like the discovery that Cloud has been researching for a cure, despite the fact that he really doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem like the scientific type, and the eventual conclusion to this plot line is so happy and inspirational, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get so many feels that you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even realize the disturbing implication that Aerith\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spirit was basically letting millions of people die while she waited for Cloud to get his groove back to disperse the cure. Yeah. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not set in stone that that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what happens, but come on, the cure was water hiding under the flower garden in her church, just waiting to get blown up in battle. And Aerith is acknowledged as being attached to the water, probably because she died of drowning after Cloud lowered her subconscious, paralyzed body into a lake(thanks, Game Theory!).\n\nSo Advent Children fails at recapturing the magic of the game, it fails at doing it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main cast justice, it fails at thematic writing, and it fails to put together a flowing narrative. Does it do anything right on the surface? Does it work as a popcorn-munching action movie, or even as pure fanservice? Well, yes, it actually does those things. As I mentioned in the animation portion, the fight scenes throughout this film are outstanding, highly imaginative and beautifully directed clashes that are all memorable in their own way, and have stood the test of time as major inspirations on CG animation. The battle of Bahamut Sin was likely a huge influence on the Nevermore fight in the first season of RWBY, which was also the point that convinced a lot of people to not drop the series. And speaking of the Bahamut fight, this movie features appearances from all your favorite Final Fantasy 7 characters, all crowbarred into the movie with about as much purpose and grace as the cast of Street Fighter 2: The Animated movie, so yeah, not a very high bar there. Still, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking to see your favorite game\u00e2\u0080\u0099s characters in a CG movie that gives them all at least a few seconds to shine(before pissing you off with some stupid Shera flyby scene) then yeah, at least it has that to offer.\n\nFinal Fantasy 7: Advent Children is available on DVD at most retailers that sell used media, as well as new and very cheap on both Amazon and Ebay.  The Complete Edition is available on Blu-Ray from Sony Pictures home Entertainment for a surprisingly low price. The soundtrack CD can be purchased through Amazon, along with several other renditions on the home video release. The original game is difficult to find online for an affordable price unless you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re willing to take a chance on a lesser quality used copy on Ebay, so if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind an alternative recommendation, I would highly suggest Final Fantasy 9, which I consider to be the actual best game in the franchise thus far, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brand new on Amazon for only fifteen dollars. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re dead set on a brand new copy of VII, happy hunting.\n\nWhen I bought the complete edition of this movie, I did so with the expectation that it would present me with a more complete story and a more easy to understand plot. As it turns out, the anime-style Denzel backstory in the special features was far more revealing to me than the extra footage was. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I saw a single new scene that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t better off left on the cutting room floor. They wrecked the pacing, turning a confusing fast movie into a slightly less confusing boring movie, and if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m starting to sound like I prefer the original to the Complete Edition, well, I do. Whatever complaints I may have had about that headache-machine, this version is decidedly worse, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two hour run-time threatened to put me to sleep. I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not worth watching\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Hell, I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not worth owning, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visual and sound qualities are far too outstanding and innovative to not include it in your collection, but the only reason I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend this version over the original is because of the kind of justice that the Blu-Ray format does to it. All the same, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a pretentious piece of forced fanservice, and those of you who have the ability to turn your brains off probably should. I give Final Fantasy 7: Advent Children a 5/10, and the Complete Edition a 4/10."}, {"id": 3238, "score": 20, "body": "\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a long time since humanity unlocked the barrier between us and the infinite cosmos, truly becoming a member of the interstellar community\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Hell, you know it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a long time when aliens have even become commonplace in a racially exclusive country like Japan\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve become such a normal part of our everyday lives that nobody questions the slug monster sitting in the seat in the back by the window, just waiting to star in his own anime. But this story isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t about that slug, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about the far more human looking aliens from the planet Valhalla. There are eight princesses on Valhalla, each more beautiful than the last\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But none of them are more fair, or more elegant, than the blonde bombshell Valkyrie. And thus, none of them are more suitable for political marriage.\n\nWith her long, loving link to one loser of a lothario looming in the immediate future, Valkyrie jumps ship, and then crashes that ship into the planet of Earth\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Whereupon her reckless flying has cost the life of one Japanese youth with a bathhouse to run and what should have been a long, happy life to run it. Feeling guilty for her actions, Valkyrie gives the young man half of her soul, resurrecting him as good as new\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 although, due to her own sacrifice, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reverted back to a loud-mouthed brat of a toddler! With the two of them now bound together by a promise much stronger than the red thread of fate, will their newfound romance survive in the face of\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Wait, romance? How the hell did they get a romance out of that? Screw this, plot summary over.\n\nUFO Ultramaiden Valkyire was produced by Media Factory Inc. from 2002 to 2004, around the same time that they did such great looking gems as Ikki Tousen and Green Green. Yes, this was indeed a dark time for them. This company HAS produced some great looking shows in both it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earlier and later years, but the early 2000\u00e2\u0080\u0099s saw Media Factory release some of the cheapest, ugliest looking anime I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen, and while Valkyrie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not even the worst one, it was produced by a company that, at the time, was pumping out consistent crap, a load from which it was no exception.\n\nTo be fair, there are a few impressive looking scenes in this show. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an early scene that features Valkyrie in both child and adult forms dancing in the rain that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually kind of beautiful in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s simplicity. The transformation scenes, while kind of creepy, are also well done. But shots like these are few and far between, as the rest of the show just looks awful. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve complained about characters being frozen in the background before, but most shows have the brains to put those frozen characters in positions where they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re standing still looking at either each other or the main characters. In Valkyrie, extras are frozen all over the place, sometimes in situations where it would be physically impossible to stand perfectly still, like in the pool.\n\nAction on screen in minimal, and what action we do get is often repeated shot for shot as recycled stock footage, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not just talking about the transformations. For the most part, the art is just as bad, with characters constantly off-model, moving in unnatural ways through even less natural spurts of activity. Their designs are generic and bland looking, at least in terms of the human characters. The aliens actually do look quite inspired and creative, especially with the awesome designs of the princesses of Valhalla, despite obvious resemblances to Ah My Goddess. Yes, I noticed.. There is some creativity here, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 This is a world where giant bananas walk around with legs, and quite frankly, Space Dandy would have a field day here.\n\nThe music, on the other hand, is fine. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not great, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also makes for a pretty pleasant listen out of context. The variety of beautiful harp and rock-orchestral background tracks work really well with what little material the show gave them, and it was even pretty damn clever how many different versions of the tune Ride of the Valkyries you can spot. The one they used as the theme for Child Valkyrie is, on it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own, a lot funnier than the character it was assigned to. The opening and closing, unfortunately, are nowhere near as impressive. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hate either of them, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really nothing substantial about them to justify more than a couple of watches before just skipping them outright. I think the biggest problem either one has, despite the catchiness of Itoshi Kakera and the decent groove of Save, is the metallic sound quality applied to both vocalists, which just gave me headaches every time I listened to them.\n\nThe English dub was a decent enough effort by ADV Films, and god bless these actors, they were really trying to make their characters work. well, most of them were\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I have no idea what Cynthia Martinez was doing, other than overacting and trying to project as much emotion as she possibly could. Greg Ayres was surprisingly boring in the lead male role of Kazuto, especially considering what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been proven to be capable of in other shows. I honestly blame bad direction for that one. Monica rial varies up her delivery a little bit, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a cookie-cutter performance from her.\n\nI used to be a huge fan of Kira Vincent Davis back in the early 2000\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, back when she was still active and did more roles than just Strike Witches reprisals. She plays dual roles in this show, both the adult and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Ahem, child form of her title character, but her performance falls far short of what she was able to pull off in Elfen Lied. She plays the roles as they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re written\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Boring in her adult form, and nightmarishly obnoxious in child form, which is pretty much on par with the standard the legendary Megumi Ogata set in the Japanese track. I can SAY that a better actor could have made the character in both forms sound more interesting, but if somebody like Ogata couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it, then I guess Davis did a serviceable enough job.\n\nOn the other hand, there were a few performances I genuinely did enjoy. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made fun of Nancy Novotny in the past\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And after Elfen Lied, she deserves it in endless portions\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But she is awesome in the role of the cantankerous Princess Hydra, and the best part is that she even manages to make her character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s child form sound a lot more tolerable than Valkyrie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. Some of the only laughs I got from this series were from Christine Auten\u00e2\u0080\u0099s over-the-top turn as Miss Sanada, an obsessive, single-minded maid who has devoted her entire life to serving Valkyrie, especially now that she finds her highness\u00e2\u0080\u0099s child form so damn cute. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m honestly not sure how I feel about that, since she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of a terrible character, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to that later. Chris Patton is also on point and very funny as Valkyrie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s louse of a fiance, Prince Triam.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most impressive about this dub are the in-universe songs, all of which were translated into English. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no Beck, by any means, but whoever was in charge of writing these deserves to be commended for their effort. The director involved also did a great job on these, as they got one hell of an awesomely bad recording of Cynthia Martinez rocking out like there was nobody in the room but her bathroom mirror, which\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Believe it or not\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Was the original intention. The catgirl songs led by Miss Sanada were also really funny, despite the troubling implications behind them. There weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a lot of huge changes to the script\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The company was still a few years off from Ghost Stories starting that unfortunate trend\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still pretty impressive. I would personally recommend the Japanese, but if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a fervent dub fan, this one is pretty good.\n\nNow, having read my thoughts on the English dub, you may have come to the conclusion that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like the two main characters of this series very much. well, you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be wrong. There are just over a dozen regular or prominent characters in this particular season, and I like a grand total of four of them\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 One of which, surprise surprise, is actually in the main cast. But getting back to Kazuto and Valkyrie, well, they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a single interesting quality between them. Adult Valkyrie does get some explanation of her personality, insofar as the fact that she bottles up her emotions and pretends to be strong, but that really only comes through in the first episode. We barely get to see her as an adult, and as a child, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just an insufferable whiny little brat who abuses her alien dog, throws tantrums, breaks things, and says creepy things about her relationship with Kazuto that seem specifically designed to be taken the wrong way.\n\nAnd as for her knight in yawning armor, Kazuto falls into a very special category for me. A seriouis pet peeve of mine is when the main character of a story has only one goal: to preserve the status quo. I want my protagonists to want something, whether it be love, status, or something they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t yet realize they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need. Kazuto owns his bath house, and he wants to serve his community with it, and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Nothing. The only conflict he ever faces is the possibility of change, which, thanks to constant coincidences, never truly occurs in ways he can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t handle. New characters appear, shit gets wrecked, and weird things happen to his friends, but as long as his own personal routine isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t changed, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fairly inactive character.\n\nTheir relationship, too, is extremely troubling in the message that I sincerely hope I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m misreading\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Kazuto and Valkyrie are in love, despite having nothing in common, no chemistry and him showing no affection whatsoever towards her, and in order to turn her into a much more mature and voluptuous adult, all they have to do is share a magical kiss. So, if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m reading between the lines properly, This series is trying to tell us that all it takes to turn a little girl into an adult woman is some intimate contact. sounds kind of pedophilic to me. All things considered, I should be rooting for the underdog, Kazuto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s childhood friend Akina\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Because let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just be honest, the childhood friend is always the underdog in these shows\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But Akina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only personality trait IS her unrequited love for Kazuto.\n\nAs much as I loved Christine Auten\u00e2\u0080\u0099s acting, and as funny as Miss Sanada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obsession over Valkyrie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well-being may be, I just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t over the fact that she is a literal slave driver. The first thing she does after landing on Earth is take out a transform an entire legion of unassuming teenage girls into cat girl, complete with ears, a tail, and a complete brainwash to go with them. She turns them into slaves whose only purpose in life is to serve their extraterrestrial leader without question and likely without payment. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t laugh at this without wondering how their families are being affected by it. Also, I like the fact that Kazuto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sister is an over-achiever who tries to manage money to make up for her brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sinking of their finances into the bathhouse, and there was some potential for depth with her attempt at having a modicum of a social life, but the series did absolutely nothing with it!\n\nSo who were the four characters I liked? Well, the most important one was Princess Hydra, the blue-haired fireball who came after Valkyrie when the marriage duty was shifted onto her shoulders instead. She was turned into a child herself, and from there, she became one of the only characters in the show who had the audacity to call little Valkyrie on her behavior\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And since she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only one who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not in love with Kazuto, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only one who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s able to antagonize her without an ulterior motive. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot more entertaining than Valkyrie, in the same way that Donald Duck is more entertaining than Mickey Mouse\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yes, the latter may be the star and icon of the series, but the former actually faces consequences and does amusing things.\n\nEven on a less comedic note, while Valkyrie may say that she was tired of facing the stress and expectations of royal life, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot more subtle in Hydra\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case, as soon after being turned into a kid, she calms down and accepts it, developing a love-hate sort of sisterly relationship with Akina. As for the other three? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m talking about Marduke, Spottenheim, and Mur, the three little white aliens that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken to calling The Three Marshkateers. As soon as I heard that they had a backstory that extended back to some intergalactic war that the three of them were notoriously a part of, I instantly wished I could have seen a spin-off OVA series about them, instead of the piece of shit they were introduced in.\n\nIn any case, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s get back to my problems with Kazuto and Valkyrie. Because really, the setting and concept aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t horrible\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The characters really do comprise at least 80 percent of my beef with this show. If the pedophilic relationship between them and Kazuto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s refusal to accept change weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bad enough, both of these elements are cranked up to the extreme as this season builds up to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s climax. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to spoil the ending for you, but\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 No, you know what? I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care if I spoil it. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll spoil, at least, the penultimate episode. Not how it ends, but how that ending is set up. If that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still too much for you, skip the next paragraph.\n\nWhile Miss Sanada is making some purchases online, Valkyrie screws around with her laptop and accidentally orders an asteroid. In their attempts to return it, they find out that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a hot spring inside, so they open a hot spring on the asteroid, drumming up brand new business! But here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the problem\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The bath water has unexpected healing properties that are giving her her soul back! And while the rest of the cast struggle to accept this as the good thing that it is, they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lie to themselves. If Valkyrie turns back into an adult permanently, their relationship will stop being a pedophilic, passionless, chemistry-free romance based entirely on guilt over a manslaughter, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to carry on as actual adults without supernatural obligations to each other. This is about the part when my bemusement at how stupid the series was turned into raw anger. Yes, I know harem shows like to be as chaste and asexual as possible while shoving fanservice in our faces, but this is a depth I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expecting them to stoop to. I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell you how this conflict is resolved, but it does in fact involve random convenient coincidences. Because of course it does.\n\nNow, hopefully, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already turned a good amount of you off from ever watching this show, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still one group that I know I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reached yet\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The booby hunters. Yes, fanservice is abound in the anime medium, but explicit fanservice\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 AKA, nudity with actual female nipples\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that easy to find outside of hentai. Well, anybody who came into this show through ADV\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advertisements know they were promised lots of naked girls, and if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really enough to make a series worthwhile to you, then yes, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find that here. You can find it in bucket loads\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Provided that you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind naked little kids, badly drawn characters, and constantly recycled animation of random bathing girls with horns on their heads. Oh, also? I know the nipples are going to be a big draw for this group of viewers, so let me clarify something else\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 There is never any variation in skin tone between areola and breast, making the actual detail you were looking for extremely hard to make out in several scenes.\n\nIn the time that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been reviewing anime, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve often heard people telling me that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m too hard on the medium, and that I take it too seriously. When I bring up problems, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m told that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m nitpicking, and that of course I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enjoy a show while I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m taking a negative attitude into it. When I watch a harem show like this, or Haganai, or Girls Bravo, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not supposed to focus on the fact that a creepy woman is filming kids in the changing room, or that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basically producing child porn, or that the manager readily accepts her offering of a bribe. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m supposed to laugh at how silly the situation is. In regards to Kazuto and Valkyrie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not supposed to pay any attention to the fact that she fled one forced marriage just to fall head over heels for her own reckless driving victim, or that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s traded one forced loveless romance for another, or that anybody she landed on could have reasonably taken the brunt of her affections\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just supposed to root for them because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the main couple.\n\nWell, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry it looks like I take my anime seriously\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But I do. I have standards, and even if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t agree with them, I enjoy picking apart a show and experiencing it on a deeper level than most will be willing to reach for. I like writing down my thoughts, and if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m proud of how they turn out, I like to post them online for people to possibly read. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why I stick to my guns through a show no matter how much I might hate it. To be fair, if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m enjoying a show enough, I may overlook or even forgive it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flaws. I saw Yuki Yuna is a Hero a few weeks ago, and I liked the characters, animation and tone so much that I was ultimately able to forgive it for being dumber than a box of hammers and a complete rip-off of a superior series. I like to pick apart a series without being disgusted by what I find, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry, but this series just makes me sick. Maybe if Kazuto had started the series resenting Valkyrie for barging into his life and forcing the burden of her soul and child self on her, but then learned to love her over time\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 well, it would still be creepy, but at least it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel so forced!  But hey, if seeing Ah! My Goddess retooled and aimed at the pedophile market appeals to you, then please, by all means\u00e2\u0080\u00a6  Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come near me.\n\nUFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie is available stateside in way too many formats. It was originally released in individual four episode sets, each of which ran for about thirty bucks apiece,. The series was rescued by Funimation for some ungodly reason\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They probably knew that they could make a mint off of the booby hunters in their audience\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And can be found in thinpack sets, as well as two SAVE sets that cover it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s third and fourth seasons, as well as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one terrible OVA episode. The manga is not available stateside. I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen the third or fourth seasons, but I have seen the second, and from what I remember, it was a slight improvement over the first. I might review it at some point\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Hell, I should, since I bought both seasons.\n\nIn truth, I saw this series ten years ago, at which point I considered it the worst anime I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d ever seen. It no longer holds that title a decade later, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remained very faithfully in the bottom ten ever since. In the years since I saw it, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been happy to see it lost in eternal obscurity, and hell, one of the few people I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve spoken to who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen it was even aware enough of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flaws to call it The Pedophile anime. Others have defended it, calling it funny, which I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get. Maybe these jokes are new to you if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never seen them before, but I have, and they all fell flat for me. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a dreary, uncomfortable series that I knew I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d eventually have to revisit, and yet I still can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t call it completely awful, as it does have a pretty good soundtrack, some much appreciated creativity, and if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m being completely honest, good pacing too. But those few good points just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t save it. I give UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie a 2/10.\n"}, {"id": 3245, "score": 30, "body": "As with the earlier installments, AMV Hell 6.66 inspired me to try out a myriad of new shows. Some of them were really good, like Arakawa Under the Bridge\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 some of them were really bad, like Another\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 There were even some guilty pleasures, like Future Diary. But the show I was the most intrigued by was Blood C. It had a few clips, but all I was paying attention to was the one of a black-clad teenage action starlet battling it out with a samurai with a giant eyeball for a head. Because that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 That\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Was one of the most awesome things I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d ever seen. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not as cool as the beat-boxing samurai from Shamploo, but damn it it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s close. So, upon watching this series, did it hold up to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own example?\n\nAs it turns out, Blood C is a member of the Blood franchise, which contains one awesome movie, one crappy live-action movie, and a fifty episode series I still haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen. The star of blood C is Saya Kisaragi, another incarnation of that iconic character\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ask\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a super popular, super pretty high school student by day, and a cold-blooded monster slayer by night. She lives with her father, and has five very loyal, very lively, very god-awful annoying friends. As the story goes on, and the monster attacks begin to strike closer and closer to home, Saya slowly begins to realize that there might be more to this situation than meets the eye.\n\nBlood C was animated by a company called Production IG, which has been around since 1988. Taking a look back at their filmography, a lot of their work may look dated by today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s standards, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no doubt that the majority of their shows were the best looking shows of their time. Blue Seed, FLCL, Ghost in the Shell SAC, and most recently, Attack on Titan. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re known for bringing their A game to most of their projects, and Blood C is no exception. Characters move fluidly, the fight scenes look awesome, and the artwork from Clamp looks equally inspired\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But while Saya and the monsters she faces may look really good, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s her friends that make the art design look a bit\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 awkward.\n\nAt first, the story is kind of a mixed bag. You have to deal with Saya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friends at school, as they openly parody Clamp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s notorious character design tropes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I wonder why they bothered, since they already did such a good job making fun of them in xxxHolic without even trying\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But on the other side of the coin, you have Saya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s battles with the monsters, which is a plot seed that starts off with a lot of promise. You see her fighting one on one with some kind of gargoyle, which is a lot of fun to watch, but then you get to see her fight the very monster that drew me into the series\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Eyeball Samurai. This is one of the best fights I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen in an anime. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s staged well, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s paced well, it ends on a great note, and Saya actually manages to save some poor girl from being killed. She saves somebody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life. Why am I drawing so much attention to this? Well\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not dance around this. Saya Kisaragi is my least favorite character of any anime, ever. That girl she saved from Eyeball Samurai? That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only character she manages to save in the entire series! I love her character design, but in a show that was already occasionally painful to watch, she is so ridiculously incompetent that she made the show physically painful to watch. She can go through some kind of transformation into a vampiric bad-ass and she proves at one point that she can do it right at the beginning of a fight\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Unless of course her class is being devoured, in which case she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll wait until only three of them are left to employ it.\n\nI really wish I were making that last part up, because half way through the series, a giant monster attacks her full classroom. So what, does she evacuate the room, tell everyone to spread out and hide, jump out the window to fight it outside, transform, and save the day? No, she just sits there and lets everyone get slaughtered! God forbid a hero takes some initiative in saving innocent civilians! And despite the fact that her teacher is practically telegraphing the fact that she knows something about the attacks, Saya never asks. She never asks why her giant monster battles aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t attracting more attention, either. For the love of God, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather have Captain Hero try to save me then ever rely on her. If I were drowning, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have a better chance of being rescued by a pack of piranhas. This girl couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t save a sandwich with a Ziploc bag!\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll admit that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of cathartic seeing monsters devour her irritating friends, but it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take very long to see the real reason why she can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t save any of them. The real reason why her power is so conveniently inconsistent. As good as this show looks, and as much promise as it shows, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gore porn. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a horror title, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not an action title, oh no, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gore porn. The main character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s credibility isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t important,\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The dialogue isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t important\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The story isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t important\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The villain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motivation is certainly not important\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 All that blood C cares about is delivering as much gore porn as possible, and if every other aspect of the show has to dumb itself down to accommodate this, then so be it.\n\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say that it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t TRY to be more than the sum of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body parts\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a metafictional scene near the end where the whole \u00e2\u0080\u0098clamp making fun of itself\u00e2\u0080\u0099 idea comes full circle, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s over so quickly that you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really enjoy it. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also some social commentary on mankind\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship to the food chain, but the way it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s delivered is just heavy-handed, tasteless, and an excuse for more gore porn. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind gore porn\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I will begrudgingly admit that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a fan of Elfen Lied, a show riddled with problems of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own. But at least there was more to Elfen Lied than it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fetishy abuse of red paint. The only elements of Blood C that had any real care or effort put into it was the art and animation, because they wanted better looking gore porn.\n\nAll in all, Blood C doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really have that much to offer. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for a gory anime that[\u00e2\u0080\u0098s centered around epic battles, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have a much better experience watching Berserk. If you wanted to see giant monsters gobble terrified people up, you could just watch Attack on Titan,. a show that does an exceptional job portraying the struggle against hopelessness. If you wanted to see an anime that pokes fun at man as a dominant predator, you could get that and so much more out of Madoka Magica, the most perfectly constructed tragedy anime in recent memory. But Blood C dumbed itself down so much to maximize the squicky blood fountains that it unintentionally created one of the least effective heroes in the history of fiction.\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to watch, and not in a good way, which is why I have no choice but to award Blood C with the dubious honor of a 3/10.

Like in a classic mystery: someone dies, we need to figure out who killed them. Tokyo Ghoul:re doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have something like that? We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re introduced to a mishmash of character who seem to not have any motivations, except one. Nothing happens that would indicate a problem until the anime is 3/4 over. The characters just live their lives, doing whatever they want, not achieving anything. The story is actually about how Haise deals with his lost memories, but the way he deals with it is so incredibly unrealistic and boring. The show cannot even get its main objective done well. Also, can we talk about Deus Ex Machina? Maybe used once or twice in a show isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that bad, but multiple times in every episode? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so annoying when none of the characters can die because everyone apparently has magical powers of living. You finally think someone will die, nope saved by some random luck. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s poor story writing when you rely on this clich\u00c3\u00a9 so heavily.\n\nArt/Animation: 6/10\nThe animation is \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeh\u00e2\u0080\u009d at best.

The opening was great; everything else was lackluster. Nothing more to be said about it.\n\nCharacters: 1.5/10\nThis is my biggest problem with the show by far. None of the characters were likable, none (Juuzou is cool tho). The show tries its hardest to make you like the characters, except Urie, and feel for their struggles, but you just feel nothing. The show makes the ghouls out to be these harmless creatures that just need to eat, but you really couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care less if any of them died. Speaking of Urie, he was the most annoying character I have ever had the misfortune of seeing in my entire life. His monologue was simply there to prove how much of a jerk he is and everything he does, everything is useless to the plot. He does nothing, but make himself look idiotic. Now, do the characters have any development? No. No, they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. The one character that is meant to have a lot of development, Haise, is the most indecisive person I have ever seen. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to talk about the ending because of spoilers, but you cannot have a character develop when they are constantly fluttering back and forth on how to behave.

Because banana.\n\nAmnesia was produced by a company called Brain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Base. I had not hear of this company until today, and if my Facebook poll results are any kind of evidence, you probably haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t either. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a real shame, because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re actually kind of amazing. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve put out a lot of highly visually impressive shows, such as Baccano, Penguindrum, and Durarara!! One of my favorite ways a company can achieve visual splendor is by carefully and skillfully allocating their budget so that not a single cent is wasted or wanted for. Amnesia is actually a perfect microcosm of their work, insofar as the fact that it has a lot of money to spend on big-budget special effects, intricately detailed and deliberately lit backgrounds, and an attention to detail that carries over to an outstanding sense of quality control.\n\nThe human characters don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t move much, but the movements they make are just fluid enough so that no viewer should ever have to complain about them looking cheap. It also helps that the series had a really smart sense of visual direction behind it, and unlike a lot of shows, the 2D and 3D animation complement each other perfectly. One thing people may complain about is something Brain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Base had no real control over\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The character designs. While the art style and the anatomical qualities of the human characters may be pleasing to the eye, this series completely jumps the shark in three areas\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Hair, clothes, and eyes. I alluded in the plot synopses that each male character in our heroine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s harem is designed with a different suit from a deck of cards in mind. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a hearts boy, a diamonds boy, a clubs boy, a spades boy, and even a Joker boy. Oh and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a boy only she can see, who looks like the Homestuck version of Peter Pan, if you can believe it.\n\nIf there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one good thing I can say about these character designs, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that if you cosplayed one of them, you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be confused for any other show\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 unless somebody really thought that Wonderland had a Chip\u00e2\u0080\u0099n\u00e2\u0080\u0099Dales club. Each boy is adorned with the symbol of their respective suit, as well as different styles of leather jackets, including a hooded variety, a turtleneck variety, a too-small variety, and a duster variety. Of course, because reverse harems do occasionally follow the rules a of regular harems, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also color-coded, mainly through the artificial coloring in their male scene hair. They also never change clothes unless they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at work, meaning that they wear these weird get-ups in public, day after day, without fail. Yes, this is common in some anime, but not in slice-of-life anime, damn it!\n\nThe music is nice at first, but it can become wearisome really quickly. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mostly piano, and as pretty as it might be at a glance, it becomes repetitive, much like your typical visual novel soundtrack\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 tunes are meant to be played for long periods of time in the background while the player reads through dialogue and occasionally makes a choice, and that style sadly doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t translate well to animation. The opening, on the other hand, is outstanding. The song is called Zoetrope, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a ice listen regardless of whether you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching the video or not, but combined with the on-pace video does a much better job of making the main character and the main plot of the show interesting than ANYTHING in the actual story does. It goes through the tired cliche of showcasing all of the Harem character profiles, but it does so really quickly, instead spending the majority of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time showing the heroine lost and confused in a dark abyss full of phantom playing cards.\n\nThe English dub was done by Sentai filmworks, and I really want to try to be nice about this, because the cast was obviously trying their hardest with the material given to them. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to like any of them, not because they performed badly, but because there wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really any room in the show to perform well. Add to that a cast who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest name is Christopher Ayres, and you have to wonder just how many of their biggest names must have looked at the script and refused outright to have anything to do with it(And if this IS the case, God bless Emily Neves and Jay Hickman for having the decency to at least take bit parts). I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure why they bothered dubbing this anime in the first place, since there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really nothing any American actor could add to the experience.\n\nMaggie Flecknoe is our main character, presumably because she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only actor they had who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bland and easy enough to overlook that they knew a nameless character with no agency or personality wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make her look any worse. Not surprisingly, she also played the hapless female lead in Diabolik Lovers(She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also further proof that Log Horizon could get a good performance out of literally anyone). Her role never demanded any big emotional commitment from her, and like a true paycheck-desiring trooper, she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother trying to give it one. Houston Hayes and Chris Ayres actually got to put some emotion into their roles, even if that emotion began and ended with \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pissed off at you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Shannon Emmerick didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do a bad job with the cutesie Ryuksie character Orion, but then again, playing young male voices is kind of her only viable career option, so let me ask once again; \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow many A-list VAs turned this series down?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nConsidering Sentai has to be picky with which shows they dub and which ones they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, and considering how they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able to take one look at a piece of shit like Detroit Metal City and say \u00e2\u0080\u009cehhhh, maybe not this one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m honestly surprised they put forth the money to put this series out in English\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 On Blu-Ray, no less! I mean, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry, but this is one of those rare occasions when the type of story being told, and the kind of character tropes being portrayed, there really isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any real American equivalent to the material. They probably should have released this one in Japanese only, and yeah, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also how you should probably view it. One Luci Christian role\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Just one\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Could have justified it enough for a recommendation.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to begin the meaty portion of this review by running down the wonderful cast of characters that are featured in this gem. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start with the main character, named\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 She actually doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a name. When she wakes up with amnesia, she never asks anybody for any details about her life, which means that through the entire anime, we never learn her name, her family status, or even how old she is, which would be unforgivably creepy if a quick look at wikipedia didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t list her as an 18 year old college freshman. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s listed in the credits as \u00e2\u0080\u0098heroine,\u00e2\u0080\u0099which is a laugh, because \u00e2\u0080\u0098hero\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and \u00e2\u0080\u0098heroine\u00e2\u0080\u0099 are titles you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d give to characters who are active, show positive qualities, and have some sort of agency in their lives, whereas Heroine-san seems to be the personification of the term \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust go with the flow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMuch like Mayuri from Steins;Gate, the world is trying to kill her, but unlike Mayuri, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually an in-universe explanation for it(which I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spoil). She dies in each world she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in, mainly due to the fact that she likes to run out into the street without looking first, although the fact that she can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t swim may also play a factor. Of course there are other possibilities, like Orion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suggestion that if she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stay close to people at all times, she may forget how to breathe. A suggestion she takes seriously. Yes, a college student doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know that breathing is an involuntary action that even babies do. Orion also convinces her that it would be a bad idea to tell the people in her life that she has amnesia, because like I said earlier, Banana. The only conscious decision she EVER makes is picking a lock to get out of a cage, and the only reason she does that is so she can get back to her apartment and find proof that she loves someone in order to stop them from raping her. Because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how rape works? She has literally no standards for dating other than \u00e2\u0080\u009cmust be hot bishie,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and to prove it, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s see just how charming her princes are. And trust me, each one is worse than the last.\n\nHer boyfriend in the first timeline is Shin, represented by the Heart suite. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually kind of appropriate, because while none of these guys are \u00e2\u0080\u0098best choice\u00e2\u0080\u0099 material, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d consider him the \u00e2\u0080\u0098least awful choice.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a year younger than the heroine, and he has a chip on his shoulder from society shaming him for the accidental sins of his father. He cares about her, and his main issue is with jealousy\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Not a good trait to have, but a believably human one, and one that I actually would have liked to see fully worked through. Unfortunately, Heroine-san falls off a cliff and jumps to a new timeline, where she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dating Ikki, a much more boring character who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life has been tortured by what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to call the PG rated version of Dane Cook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s curse from Good Luck Chuck. He wants her because she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s immune to his charm, and the girls who ARE obsessed with him provide a constant source of antagonism for her throughout the course of the series.\n\nNext up, very briefly, is Kent, and if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an offensive stereotype for asexuality out there, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it. I know lots of women fall for the stoic guy with glasses\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Kyoya from Ouran, I feel your pain\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But they tend to have actual personality traits, like pride, or condescension, or something. Kent doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have even the most basic of emotions, and every single coupley move he makes on Heroine-san can be drawn back to advice he got online or in a book. I actually AM asexual, and no, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not like that. We have human emotions. We understand basic human interactions. Kent is not a realistic person, which makes it extremely hard to not only relate to him, but to figure out what Heroine-san saw in him as a potential lover in the first place.\n\nThen we have Toma, one of the most disturbingly popular reverse harem options ever. Do you remember how in the wake of Chris Brown beating up Rihanna, there were flurries of women online claiming it was okay, he could beat them too if he wanted to? That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Toma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fanbase in a nutshell, so let me just run down what this hopeless romantic did. There are going to be minor spoilers here. He realizes Heroine lost all her memories, so he lies to her and says they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re dating. This is already horrible, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not done. He drugs her without telling her, which she has no reaction to, even when Orion warns her about it. He then sticks her in a dog kennel\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a cage, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a dog kennel\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and claims he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trying to protect her. Her only reaction to this is \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not like this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Uh, yeah, sure, keep telling yourself that. And then, like I said, she breaks out and finds the diary on her previous self in this timeline, and it coincidentily says she loves him, which prevents him at the last second from raping her.\n\nThey make googly eyes at each other, and then in the very next shot, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the hospital with a broken leg, with no explanation offered as to how it happened, and even though I know she has a knack for getting run over, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to assume he broke it to keep her from running away again. Yeah, remember that romantic scene with the sledgehammer in Misery? Something like that. And then we meet the final boy, Ukyo, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a literal murderous psychopath with a Jekyl and Hyde style split personality, and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Can we just stop now, and admit that all of these characters are awful? Can we just all agree that this is the most unlikeable cast of main characters since The Devil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Rejects? Like I said, Shin had potential, but honestly, he wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look nearly as appealing if he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the rest of them to compare himself to. Nothing they do registers with Heroine, nothing ever alarms her, nothing ever convinces her to avoid or refute them, and Orion isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any better as he just spends the series dumping exposition and giving her terrible advice.\n\nOkay, so if the characters are terrible, how\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the plot? There is no fucking plot. Nothing that happens means anything in the grand scheme of things. As a matter of fact, you could easily skip the first four story arcs and go right to the fifth without losing anything important. The point of this series wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t to slowly unravel an intriguing mystery, or gradually learn more about our main character through several shocking plot twists, it was to fit every single story path from the original game comfortably into the series so fans of each one could get their jollies off at some point. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like the story structure of Clannad, except in that show, every arc had some sort of central purpose going forward. The only point each arc in this anime has is to make the love interest of the previous arc look more appealing by comparison.\n\nOr maybe the point is to make them more appalling? I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand the appeal of dangerous or possessive lovers. Yeah, Yuno from Future Diary is hot, but I still wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t touch her with a sixty foot pole. Maybe I just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand the whole masochism thing, or maybe I just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get the appeal of being controlled, because apparently these characters are considered legitimate sex symbols on Japan. Even the subject of caging, which the Japanese voice actor himself apparently found weird, can still cause half a room full of women to go crazy for him. I guess I can give a pass to this show when it comes to fans who know that what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching is an unhealthy escapist fantasy that would be unsalvageably horrifying in any sort of real world context, but because I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like to over-estimate people that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to have to assume there are impressionable young viewers out there\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 both male and female\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 who may catch a bad message about abusive relationships, and I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forgive that.\n\nAmnesia is available from Sentai Filmworks on both DVD and Blu-ray. It was originally really expensive, but can normally be found for low prices at certain Rightstuf sales. There are about six different entries in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visual novel franchise, and while I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel like listing them all down, a few of them are available as imports to Playstation Vita. The series can also be viewed on Crunchyroll.\n\nAmnesia is the perfect example of a show that just gets worse and worse as it continues on. I originally didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think too poorly of it, as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been pre-warned about some of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s early flaws, and the way it played to popular dating sim character tropes, so I was at least expecting to enjoy it on a so-bad-it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-good basis. What I actually got was a series that was so devoid of energy and passion that I found myself dozing off through most of the episodes. And yet, as boring as it was, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a surprisingly dangerous series, in the same ballpark as Popotan, albeit with a different message and much more commendable animation. Amnesia could easily teach young girls that toxic behavior is forgivable in a man as long as he truly loves you, especially since the main character is specifically designed to be a lego brick, and thus have no name or personality so that any viewer can imagine themselves in the role. I even found out very recently that fans of the original game hate it, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s saying something. I give Amnesia a 1/10."}, {"id": 3255, "score": 27, "body": "*spoilers for Big Order*\n\nBig Order is an enigma. It's beyond our comprehension, in the worst way possible. It throws you for all kinds of loops in the dumbest, more surreal ways imaginable, thinking that's it's a clever, emotional, deep, and truly thought-provoking being when in reality, it's a sloppy, horrifically told mess. Trying to really understand everything about it is to succumb to a Lovecraftian horror that will destroy your mind and soul since it actually manages to be both convoluted in all the potentially interesting and deep ways while fucking it all up and being convoluted the wrong ways. It doesn't answer all the right questions we are left with, and it sometimes answers them in ways that make things worse. Hell, it doesn't even understand the revolting implications of some of its characters actions, so how the hell can it expect to understand the major plot it has created?\n\nIt's actually futile to try to understand this anime since it doesn't even understand itself that well. It's like it's final antagonist, trying to delve deep into something it was never gonna truly get, making detrimentally wrong decisions, and losing sight of what it tried to do as it went and tried to one-up itself in \"craftiness\" and \"mind-bending twists\". It knows what it's trying to be, but that it's trying to be is something it cannot handle, which is truly fitting given that many of its characters suffer that exact same fate. So, just how badly did Big Order implode in on itself? Or rather, just what happened to make it suffer that fate? Well, let's find out, shall we?\n\nBasically, 10 years ago, Eiji made a wish that ended up destroying the world, add that wish was to dominate it for world peace. Now, you're asking why didn't he say \"I want world peace\"? The thing is, it wasn't his actual wish, it was his sister's. I know I'm jumping the gun but I need to tackle this early. The flashbacks make it seem like she's a girl who can comprehend full conversations and the state of our worlds as well as empathy by then we learn she was only 3, making this make little sense since actual 3 year olds don't do any of that. I know this because the flashback specifically states 10 years ago, as well as the fact that in the final episode, she turns 14 soon after the major events of the final episode. Now, basically, the plot tries to one up itself in terms of stringing its MC along for all sorts of twists, turns, betrayals, etc., so let's tackle some of them, as well as a few other moments and see what went wrong, shall we? After all, it's hard to really describe the plot well given how wrecked it is, but we can attack it's logic and see why the story falters, in sort of a rapid fire kind of fashion, though this isn't my usual formula.\n\nWhen Kurenai Rin stabs Eiji's sister (Sena) in the shoulder with a sword and she bleeds horribly, you'd expect that when Eiji reaches her far more than 10 minutes later given how the episode presents itself, that she would actually be dead from blood loss. Eiji takes down two heavily armed and protected dudes by going ham with a sign (that was never shown), so yeah, that's dumb. If Rin wanted to finish off Eiji herself, she definitely shouldn't have ordered her men to riddle him with bullets (regardless of the fact that it didn't even work). When Eiji effectively puts her in his dominion, or rather, when he uses his order to block the shots before he uses his dominion order, she, for no reason, heals Sena and he never even ordered to. She wants to know why, and neither she nor we get a definite answer since we never hear him tell her to heal his sister. Barring the stuff I listed above that ultimately is explained away by the big Sena twist, this is basically all of the really crazy illogical moments from episode 1. Keep that in mind. Also at the end of the episode, Eiji uses his Order avatar to wrap Rin and given the audio and the way the episode fades to black for the credits, it basically sounds like he basically forced her into tentacle rape, and I'm not sure if they really wanted that implication or maybe they did it as a joke. Dunno.\n\nCharacters betray each other for no good reason. I mean, Franc betrays the group in episode 7 for no adequately explained reason only to do a face turn, only to do another heel turn in the finale. Characters also try to outsmart each other all the time, to varying and often pathetic degrees of success in terms of making any sense, like how in episode 4, one of the 10 members working for them was pretending to work for the enemy by giving the enemy heavily compromising information that jeopardizes his side's own plans to nearly getting their pawn (Eiji) killed (even though it easing their own order), or well, everything in one ginormous sequence in episode 7 that amounts to the two leaders trying to outwit each other until they are betrayed by one of their own (Rin for the bad guys and Franc for the \"good guys\", except Rin's was a part of the bad guys' plan). It's like the writer(s) decided to try to make the story one-up itself in terms of convoluted schemes of planning around plans and adding in betrayals regardless of whether or not it can be easy enough to remotely follow or if it all makes sense.\n\nCharacters also don't use their OP AF powers on ways that actually make good sense in their situations. There are a few notable accounts of this. Episode 3: Eiji has the Group of 10 (what a boring name) under his dominion and claims to be in control (though that's what they want), and he doesn't even do anything to bind them under his will aside from \"don't leave my domain\". If he really wanted to be in control, he should've tried to make them actually submit to his power and decisions via his dominion instead of saying \"you're in my dominion\" and expecting them to just follow him and not get him entangled in their scenes. Episode 6: A swordsman has an inter-dimensional sword that can slash between dimensions, and when he has Eiji and Iyo in his sights (as well as a now useless colleague and Kuroko (the Miko of vitality and couples in episode 6 who is gorgeous AF), he swipes vertically to kill the latter two. Even if it's revealed that Eiji needed to be alive for his father (the main antagonist), did he swordsman know that? Why not swipe vertically to kill everyone, or if he knew that he needed Eiji alive, why not depends diagonally to try to cut off a limb to make him more susceptible to capture? Episode 10: Sena Wishes dominion over the world for world peace. Even if she was basically 3 at the time, why didn't she just wish for world peace? So that the plot could happen? There had to have been better ways of making this work, like maybe trying to justify why she didn't (like maybe she wanted to emulate the world domination aspect of her idol book comic character, or maybe she didn't think it through at all). Instead, she wished for world domination and couldn't handle the power so it fucked over the world. Also, when Eiji wished to shoulder all of the damage she did with that wish, how does it equate to him taking her power, messing both his and her memories, and basically suppressing and replacing their memories of their father? Bah! Moving on!\n\nAs I said, this show doesn't understand any of the downright horrible implications of some of the characters' actions. Let's run down the list, shall we? The Group of Ten basically leaked info to basically ruin a high schooler's life by turning the world against him and manipulating him into their schemes just so they can kill his father and stop his plans, even knowing that both he and his sister were crucial in his plot. That literally makes no sense and the fact that they expect him to go along with it is especially galling. They basically made him a global pariah worse than Adolf Hitler, so no shit he often has a hard time of complying! In episode 4, Eiji and Sena are in bed with him on top in a very sexual position, and then we next see all of their clothes on the floor and an open shower curtain. Regardless of the fact that we only blatantly know that they're just showering together, it's very creepy for a teenage boy to shower with his not much younger sister at their ages. Also, given all of this context, you can imagine that the implications of actual incest run rampant here, which is just not good. Hell, the fact that she kisses him in the final episode of the anime (without any context to blatantly suggest otherwise), it's basically confirmed that she was wanting to have incest with him, or at least heavy implications make it come off that way.\n\nTime for this last example to really sell my point home. In episode 9, Iyo has Eiji handcuffed to a bed with just his shirt off and they take off their clothes, but he is trying to decline sex in favor of current matters, and given the context of what's going on, it's implied from the anime that she was already sorta having sex anyway thanks to Eiji's line about her going any deeper, and again, he never actually consented and she was still trying to have sex with him. Does that sound like rape to you, because it does to me. Don't try to give me some bullshit spheal about \"women can't rape men, that's not how that works; at worst, it's only physically possible for it to be sexual harassment or assault\" since she had him chained up to something without his knowledge or consent and is trying to have (and given the anime's context, likely in the middle of having) sex regardless of his declining (likely because he'd rather save it for a time where his sister wasn't in danger) so that counts as attempted rape, even if none of the characters realize it as such. Do you see what I mean by horrid implications that no character seems to take into consideration regarding their actions!\n\nBefore we get to the real meat of the convoluted nature of the series, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also smash a few weird ass scenes apart since, well, this anime is beyond strange. The ultimate example of this is the beginning of episode 5. Kagekiyo basically grabs and fondles the tits of Rin, Mari (the chick with the glasses and lasers), and Iyo, all while basically having an orgasm over their \u00e2\u0080\u009ctwin peaks\u00e2\u0080\u009d when she fondles them enough, getting her ass kicked every time, brushing it off like it's nothing before moving to her next target, and not learning not to be such a perv to other women. All this scene adds is time and discomfort. I've already talked about the episode 4 scene that really hints at incest, so I'll tackle one more scene: Eiji gets an arm and a leg cut off in episode 8, and the moment he uses the Eiji x Iyo fusion of his Order avatar, he can suddenly manipulate his limbs to attach to him for no reason other than asspulls since it was never shown to be able to do that. I know orders defy conventional logic, but they only do that via the user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ordered actions, not by nature of their existence.\n\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this whole thing about how the people hate Order users because they hate Eiji for what happened to the world. Problem is, the way they go about this is hamfisted. Civilians in this show are absurdly hateful and are portrayed in this vicious, uncivilized, basically evil light. Also, you know, it seems like none of them try to move on from their grief and put it past them in order to try to live a better life. I get that their families were killed and their lives were inverted but everyone comes off as insanely hateful for the sake of it. I'll address the final thing that makes the civilians on the show horrible when we get there.\n\nYeah, time to delve into the big plot of the second half. Given that the anime ended a few months before the manga did, I can only assume that all of this, or at least a good chunk of it (namely the final episode or 3) was filler, though even with the research I did (without reading the manga or knowing someone who has) I cannot prove this. Well, it turns out that the Group of 10 were initially meant to track down and kill Genai, Eiji\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father, and you can refer to a few paragraphs ago on why that is horse shit when taking everything into account. Also, the bad guys are tracking down and trying to kill mikos. Apparently it's because they are involved in this pentagram involved with the gate to this mental world that he wants to unlock because it was Sena that originally did so, though she couldn't control it, causing the world to be ravaged, apparently so that he can create an infinite amount of parallel universes, including ones where Sena\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wish was granted and she was happy and world peace, even if it means forsaking the universe that we are currently seeing our characters in and everyone storms the place and betrayals and Eiji denouncing his goal and getting stabbed by his sister and then fusing orders and kicking ass and winning and God shows up and the world is now good and now that means everyone sees Eiji as a hero which makes no sense given how much whiplash that is with how hateful they were and good ending and blah blah blah! I'm not even gonna question any more aspects of the finale like the memory parasite robots or anything since my mind is fried beyond belief. \n\nAnother crucial problem is that very few of these characters have any remotely interesting personality to speak of, so I'll prattle a lot of them off quick. The Group of 10 are mostly useless, with only a few of them being relevant like the leader, Mari, Iyo, and 3 other dudes who only do one specific thing like flying, teleporting, and punching, and some of them are so useless that they don't even have any real screen time, and of course, each of them is basically one note and dull, even the fun-loving flying and punching dudes are just meh, and are just there for deus ex machinas. Even the main character Eiji is a boring teen protagonist who is basically Lelouch if he had the personality of an ordinary school protagonist, including his devotion to making his sister happy. Rin is just an annoying chick who always wants to kill Eiji until one final sappy scene where she motivates him in the final episode. Also, yeah, different hair color aside, her design is strikingly similar to that of Yuno from Mirai Nikki. Kagekiyo is just a vengeful and quirky person who also happens to be a total perv (and probably either bi or lesbian given the twin peaks scene in episode 5), and is basically irrelevant aside from episodes 3 and 4, and one scene in the finale. Also, Sena is basically a worse Nunnally who sorta is in love with her brother and is the one  actually responsible for the world ending. Plus, her heel turn in episode 9 was abominable.\n\nNow into the full-blown antagonists. I don't even think most of them have names aside from Jyuubei (the sword guy) and Genai (the main antagonist). Aside from Genso, there nothing but generic, borderline personality-less baddies. It's sad when Fairy Tail can come up with tons of evil teams (Oraci\u00c3\u00b3n Seis, Tartarus, Grimoire Heart, Phantom Lord, and a good few others) that have each and every character have some kind of defined personality with some of them getting sort of fleshed out, and in rarer cases, even developed and yet no one here has a truly concrete personality aside from the most generic templates of a personality. Genai has this weird obsession with flowers and the series tries its damnedest to make him a sympathetic scientist father whose plans drove him insane and ruined everything for everyone, but when they can't even do a good job with his backstory, the backstory about him for one of the characters, or even how despite supposedly  caring so much for Eiji and Sena he never actually shows care after the major incident (he never looks for them orthopedic to get others to do the same, and he doesn't care how badly their hurt as long as they're alive and useful), even he misses the mark. \n\nI can't even really begin to describe Daisy in any way that isn't how much teasing he does to Eiji about his powers and memories. She is as much of an enigma as the show itself, and I don't think it was as intentional as you might think since we know nothing about her backstory other than the fact that she was used as the vessel of an experiment that caused her to become some kind of floating person that hands out Orders. We never really see that from her perspective, nor does she really have anything concrete about her aside from her great looks and how much she teases Eiji about pertinent information. What was she like before? Did the change affect her in any way? Why did she get a job as a waitress at the end of the series! Despite being one of the more prominent characters in the series, I probably have the least feel for what kind of personality she has. Also, the only Miko we get to know aside from Iyo is Kuroko, a beautiful lady who has perfect vitality and spend her days basically forging couples, and it's funny to hear her get annoyed when Eiji and Iyo don't understand one another and have awkward moments despite them being obviously the pair that will be a couple, though she doesn't really get to do much since she was killed off unceremoniously. She was, all things considered, the best character in the show, and when a basically one-off character is the best character in your entire series, that's pretty pathetic.\n\nThe character art...is inconsistent. Sometimes it looks amazing, with all sorts of wonderful shading to complement the (mostly) wonderful (albeit sometimes borderline copy paste) character designs, and other times, it looks flat with characters having none of that shading. It would've been great if Studio Asread were capable of doing what Studio Wit did with Kabaneri and managed to have the perfect shading all the time instead of only sometimes, but hey, it's better than having the flat looking moments for the characters all the time. Only one design looks terrible and that's Kagekiyo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, especially with those absurdly pointy nipples that stick out from her g-string big time. The actual animation isn't spectacular but ultimately competent, despite a few laughable moments like the way Eiji turns/slides in episode 2 (I bet you know the scene I'm talking about). The censorship is pretty terrible though, but not as horrid as the usual black bars or even black circles. The kaleidoscope imagery looked nice though, even if the series doesn't really do well in terms of having contrasting light and shadow in the same frame. Also, the CGI is pretty terrible, not just with the avatars, but especially with the nukes in episode 4 and just how prevalent the CGI is, also bogs it all down, especially since it doesn't work well with the aesthetic of the series, nor does it look good on its own. I do at least like when the imagery gets really triply like with the world destruction and with most of the final episode.\n\nThe OP \u00e2\u0080\u009cDisorder\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Yousei Teikoku...is certainly fitting in terms of its chaotic nature and how much of a mess Big Order is. I don't particularly like it, especially in comparison to some of her other songs like Mirai Nikki OP 1 or Deus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character song. The ED \u00e2\u0080\u009cKobore Sekai Oware (\u00e6\u00af\u0080\u00e3\u0083\u00ac\u00e4\u00b8\u0096\u00e3\u0082\u00ab\u00e3\u0082\u00a4\u00e7\u00b5\u0082\u00e3\u0083\u00af\u00e3\u0083\u00ac)\" by Aki Hata is...fascinating. Both somewhat unnerving and simultaneously alluring. I really like it, more so than any other piece of music in the series. The Actual OST is somewhat ok but is really unfitting (with tons of jazz pieces that sound like they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be playing at certain parts of a fun spy series instead of an anime like this), and some of them, especially the track \u00e2\u0080\u009cDominate\u00e2\u0080\u009d are played over and over again and it gets annoying since none of the tracks (aside from track 7) are particularly good. It's not that they're bad, it's that they are overused and ill-fitting most of \n\nFor a while now, Big Order was easily the most enjoyable train wreck I had ever seen. It's decisions were so baffling and out of left field that I couldn't help but laugh my ass off constantly throughout the first 6 episodes. It wasn't enjoyable in the conventional sense and the episodes got increasingly aggravating, but the last 4 episode felt more aggravating than funny bad, mainly due to how it grew stale and unbelievably convoluted, and the fact that it tried harder than ever to be serious and heartfelt rather than crazy and fun in terms of what it was trying to do. I don't actually hate the ending, partially because I couldn't even care anymore and my mind was crashing like Hindenburg or the Titanic, and blowing up like a Megaman boss. I was more distraught by its failures than infuriated or poised to laugh at them in the last 4 episodes, especially the finale. Plus, certain implications and true ramifications of situations really broke me at times. Nonetheless, I can say that for most part, I consider it to be the first truly effective schlock title I have ever seen, in the way that I laughed my ass off constantly throughout a majority of the run, for whatever that's worth.\n\nBig Order is an absolute mess. It's not just convoluted, but stupidly confusing and confusingly stupid. It becomes legitimately hard to grasp as to what is actually wrong with the story and what is just convoluted and/or absurd but intentional and not harmful. As your mind tries to parse all that, as well as the awful CGI and constant kaleidoscope imagery, as well as the unfitting music that makes you speculate as to what kind of series the OST would better suit, it all moves along at breakneck speeds. It's mentally taxing for sure, and not even mostly good character art, a few good songs, or even kaleidoscope imagery can remotely salvage that. You actively need to be mentally prepared to sit through this show or you will be left in the dust worse than any unprepared schmuck watching episode 20 of Ergo Proxy, which is an actually good anime that comes off as very convoluted at times. Big Order is a big pile \u00e2\u0080\u0098o shit and it deserves its dismal rating. It's sort of fascinating in a way if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re capable of keeping up somewhat with the absurd narrative and decisions of the show, which is probably its biggest strength despite being fully comprised of the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fatal flaws. Only watch this if you're an expert at ripping bad anime to shreds. Everyone else, spare your brain cells. With all that said, I bid you adieu."}, {"id": 3262, "score": 0, "body": "Keita Suminoe is a fifteen year old middle school student who only wants one thing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 To pass his finals, and make it into the same high school as his older twin sisters, Ako and Riko. But he has two obstacles standing in his way. The first is that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s far more athletic than scholarly, which makes studying and taking tests difficult for him to manage. And the second is that both of his sisters are madly in love with him, providing him with endless distractions as he tries to do the simplest things like eat, sleep, and of course, study. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just them, either\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 One of his teachers, a fellow student that he accidentally groped, and a short loli-like girl from his school are all starving for a taste of his knob. What can poor Keita do when these women have so much love to give to him, and he only has about six inches to give to them?\n\nKissXSis was allegedly animated by a small time company called Feel. Why do I say allegedly? Because it looks nowhere near as good as one of their other anime, So I Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Play H, whose incredible production values was it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary redeeming factor. In fact, the difference in quality between these shows that were made only two years apart is so vast that I almost want to call BS on wikipedia for telling it to me. I guess it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible that feel didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel the need to put as much money into this project as they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d later wind up pouring into H, and if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the case, I suppose I understand.  Put lightly, this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t their opus.\n\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say the animation is awful, though. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not great, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen plenty of shows that looked a lot worse than this. The artwork is crisp and clean, and a few of the character designs are inspired, although most of them look generic, and the weird little shiny marks on the girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 skin can get pretty distracting. The bare bones budget is actually managed fairly well. There are several moments when the moneysaving animation techniques are blatantly obvious, but for the most part, the series sticks to slow, limited movements that suit it best, saving it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s money for the few\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Um\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 *cough* action scenes that need it more. What bothered me was more WHAT they were animating than how they were animating it, I guess. The music isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bad either, just generic and forgettable.\n\nSo, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to go into new territory here. Over my years of reviews, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made a habit out of talking about the animation of any given series as well as the company that produced them, but never before have I talked about the TV station that they aired on. Since this show doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have an English dub for me to discuss, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really feel up to discussing the sub, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to go ahead and tell you all about a Japanese TV station called AT-X, or Anime Theater X.\n\nAT-X is a Japanese premium channel\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 In other words, a pay-per-view station\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 that, by the very nature of those words, is allowed to show most of their programs uncensored, kind of like HBO. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve aired many TV-MA titles since they were established in 2000, including Elfen Lied, Mahoromatic, Highschool of the Dead, Dance in the Vampire Bund, and the Japanese dub of My Little Pony Friendship is Magic(Wrap your head around that one). Being a pay-per-view station, they have the right to show their programming with nudity, excessive violence, groping, and all that fun adults-only stuff to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mainly adult crowd should they choose to do so, with streaming sites like Funimation.com and Crunchyroll.com opting to air censored versions anyway.\n\nThis turned out to be the perfect place for KissXSis to air, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s filled to the brim with adult imagery. Not only is there underwear shots and bare bottoms galore, this show goes all out with french kissing, lines of drool falling afterwards as a result of said kissing, frequent groping, girls peeing(from many different angles), the outline of the main character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s erect penis through his clothes as his sisters very explicitly fondle it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And yet, in the very rare moments of actual nudity, the girls in the series were given nondescript Barbie doll bodies. Considering just how little of a fuck this series gives in regards to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s content, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a hilariously bizarre omission to make. Because, yeah, as far as this show is willing to go, nipples are the line they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to cross. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s especially strange when you take into account that their brother, Keita, very clearly has nipples in the scene when Ako and Riko are teaming up to lick them. I guess it makes sense that since he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not blood related to them, he wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t share the same physical deformity that they have. At least that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the explanation that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sticking with.\n\nMy first attempt to watch this show was back in the fall of 2012. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d heard some stuff about it from both sides of the fence, so I felt some morbid curiosity as to just how bad it could really be. I wound up quitting after two episodes, already calling it the worst anime I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d ever seen. To be clear, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the incest that turned me off\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not as offended by that topic as a lot of people are. But in order to make the topic of incest appeal to a broader audience than just the people who want to jerk off to it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6  And thus, to make me tolerate it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6  you HAVE to play the societal stigma card to make the material relatable. The related couple has to face judgement from the people around them. I mentioned as much in my review of Oreimo, and I even used what little I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d seen of KissXSis as a reference tool.\n\nWhat had me running away from KissXSis as fast as I possibly could was, ultimately, the way it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s world was reacting to our three blood crossed lovers. At school, the entire male student body was obsessed with Ako and Riko, to the point that they would ostracize and bully Keita for living with them, and form an unruly mob to chase the two girls whenever they wandered onto the school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campus. The only character who showed any repulsion to the idea was some big boobed glasses girl who you could immediately tell was just going to fall in love with Keita, effectively turning what could have been moral outrage into jealousy. As I would later learn from the appearance of his teacher, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly what the writers were going for. Keep in mind, at no point in the story are we given any insight into why such bland looking characters would be sexually deified to such extreme levels.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, their parents weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just okay with this debauchery between their children\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They were encouraging it. Right at the end of episode 1, they start hounding Keita to excavate the gold mine of forbidden pussy that lived a few rooms down from him. They also drop the bomb on us that Keita and his sisters aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really related by blood\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Keita is his son, and the twins are the mom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughters, so they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re actually just step siblings, and the anime constantly shoves the fact that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not blood relatives down our throats to remind us that what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on between them is perfectly A-ok. Which, as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve mentioned in the past, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not. Children who grow up from a young age together as siblings and go through puberty in closed together become sexually desensitized to each other, and I swear I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not making that up. Whether or not they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re actually related by blood is a non-issue, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just how it works. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legally okay, but only the sleaziest perverts ever call upon legal loopholes to excuse their tastes.\n\nAfter confirming with the second episode that this show was not going to get any better, I decided I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d had enough, and stayed away from it for a year and a half. That was until my long awaited two week vacation from work, when I let my two best friends each pick an anime for me to watch in my free time, and one of them challenged me to finish the series once and for all. The only reason I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to punch him in the face is because he said I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to watch the OVAs.\n\nUpon my second attempt to watch KissXSis, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve noticed that not only does the series never get any better, but it takes every possible opportunity to get worse. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not just talking about the depraved sexual content, which any viewer will either be able to take or leave. There is nothing in this series that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even remotely suggestive of any kind of story-telling. The only plot is whether or not Keita will wind up sleeping with one of his sisters, but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so willing to fool around with either one of them at the slightest provocation that it winds up not really mattering whether they cross the line or not. The only conflict is over which sister he winds up with, but he never really shows any preference, and will happily switch between them as though they were Coke and Pepsi.\n\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no story either, as the entire series is just an endless string of moments between Keita and his sisters, with no stakes, no surprises, no revelations, just interaction after interaction, competition after competition. It can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get old, though, because unless you were on the edge of your seat waiting for something graphic to happen, it was never interesting in the first place. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s portrayal of women is insanely ignorant and misogynistic, but\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to be mad at it about that, because at no point does it ever seem to concern itself with what women are really like. Granted, I ranted and raved about that when I originally rage-quit the series, but upon a fresh look, and a surprisingly boring viewing experience that was occasionally interrupted by random bouts of \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gotta be fucking kidding me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve finally nailed what this anime is, and why it feels like a nonentity to me at this point, as well as why I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bring myself to be angry over how brain-smashingly reprehensible the content is.\n\nKissXSis is, at it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core, a sexless hentai. Now, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen several anime that I could throw that same label at before, but this is the first one I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen that was actually aired on TV. There is nothing more pointless than a safe-for-TV porno. You can not realistically expect a porno to have realistic female characters, because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a porno. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a jerk-off fantasy. The only real reason someone could possibly watch this all the way through is to jerk off to it(watching it for reviewing purposes is not a real reason\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m insane, and a horrible person, so don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do what I did). Everything that happens in this show is just build-up to sex scenes that never happen, leaving it only palatable for the most desperate viewers who are looking for a good incest romp and somehow don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t realize that there are actual hentai out there.\n\nThe only other type of audience I can imagine this series having would be people who either A: Have siblings they wish they could screw or B: Wish they had siblings they could screw, and in either case, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re droolingly eager to find some sort of escapist self-insert jerk-off fantasy where they have a pair of willing and able sisters that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t technically related to them, in a world where only the jealous haters have anything negative to say about it. That would be the life, wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it? Only no, it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Grow up, and stop kidding yourselves.\n\nKissXSis has never been released stateside, and no self-respecting legal streaming service would ever touch it with a sixty foot pole. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s available on illegal streaming sites, and while I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d normally never recommend such a tactic, I honestly don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care one way or another whether or not this title makes any money. You can also find the Malaysian bootlegs on Ebay for dirt cheap, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only about thirteen dollars for the TV version of the series, and around the same cost for the OVA series of equal length that came out a few years prior.\n\nIf KissXSis had been released as an actual legitimate hentai title, with at least the majority of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story arcs ending in sexual pay-offs, it would easily be one of the best titles in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s genre, No, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not exaggerating that. The characters are well developed and complex\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 By hentai standards. The story is intelligent and well thought out\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 By hentai standards. The animation and music are very well produced\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 By hentai standards. With actual pay-offs instead of blue-ball teasing, the pacing would have been outstanding\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 By hentai standards. But this series wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t released straight to DVD in the adults only section of your local DVD store. It was released on TV, in a much harsher and stricter medium. As a legitimate TV anime, this show is just flat out pathetic, tasteless trash that only the most desperate and depraved audiences will find any sort of satisfaction with. Since I am not one of them, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even give this show a zero without feeling like I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m being too lenient with it. Thus, I give KissXSis a -4/10.\n\nBut you can't do that here, so I guess it's another 0/10."}, {"id": 3266, "score": 38, "body": "I'm sure we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve all done it before. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve all wished we could turn back time just to fix something we did, or think twice before walking into something terrible, or otherwise take precautions we wish we would've done in the first place. Tragedy and mortifying actions occur all the time. However, in this reality, we know we can never do so, as much as we wish otherwise.\n\nChronos Ruler is a look into a fictional consequence that can come about of this wish, and it's borderline depressing, less so for the grim reminder and bittersweet message, but more so for the lack of quality in its writing. That's not to say this concept is entirely easy to do well, in fact, as I'll demonstrate later, it's very easy to screw up, it's just that it definitely loses balance on that tightrope rather fast and spends the rest of its time plummeting while grasping.\n\nS: 2:10 AM\n\nWhen it comes to stories involving the manipulation of time (especially when that's the main focus), an insane amount of detail is required. Time is in and of itself, something that while manipulative, is still not something that can be broken or contradicted. Therefore, when it comes to stories like this, the devil is in the details, and when you mix other paranormal things into it, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot you have to explain that way everything makes sense. Not only is there the how and why like with most stories, but especially in this particular case, to what extent. It's very easy to screw this vital step up, as the series demonstrates. I'm aware that I'm saying an absolute and that rarely is a storytelling \u00e2\u0080\u009crule\u00e2\u0080\u009d absolute but well, not every rule has to have an exception. Let me give you an example of this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s failings, or rather two side by side:\n\nIn episodes 1 and 2, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a huge disparity in the number of Horologues present in episode 1 with the clock tower rumor compared to the 8 times that amount present when one man willows in the streets over his life being ruined by gambling. Why does one cause more of these things to spawn than the other? How does this all work and how can they all absorb his time at once at this rate? What is the extent that these will appear and what scenarios cause more or less to appear? The show doesn't answer any of this. It's too busy playing with time for admittedly inventive and interesting attacks and effects, as well as using that for convoluted character drama that falls flat due to how ravaged the narrative is by stuff like this. You can apply some of this to multiple scenarios in the show, like with Mrs. Emily\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time being reverted in episode 1 and how it really speeds up way too much between the time she left to the time she died by comparison to literally everything else beforehand. You will not believe how many times you can do this and what it does to the narrative (less than 10 but still way too many), it's that bad.\n\nAnother thing that sinks this show (not as hard mind you) is the forced comedy tone shifts. What is it with both manga and their adaptations in particular that do this? Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood did it, Fairy Tail did it, Drifters did it, I mean come on! It's always jarring and distracting. I get that sometimes we need to lighten the mood and that it's realistic to try but even still, they never handle it right. It is always very abrupt and shifts from one emotional extreme to another. It's not as egregious as Drifters with this, but it's about as constant with it, which is a real pain since it's going from drama to slapstick in a instant; that does not work. Regardless, it's clear from all of this that the narrative of Chronos Ruler is a mess. That's putting it lightly. This isn't even covering the other holes, asspulls, and contradictions heavily present in the narrative with the way the Chronos organization is constructed and so many moments filled with these things, but I honestly don't have the patience to try. It does manage to make sense on occasion and use its interesting concepts to interesting and good effect, by it's surrounded in the slime of what I mentioned earlier. \n\nThat being said, this show does try. It tries really hard. It wants nothing more than to be a good, poignant show, and in some cases, like the actually pretty good episodes 8 and 12 (less so everything in between), and the buildup to and emotional climax of both, it actually succeeds. It shows just how deep regret can be, how people can be so awful to those who care for them and still mourn them and regret everything once those people are gone. It explores how those loving ones feel about their children who don't appreciate them at all. If nothing else, this show succeeds brilliantly at showing all of that. It shows the potential this show had of being great when it can pull this off so well. Too bad it had to shoot its foot so much early on, because now we can't fix that.\n\nC: 4:10 AM\n\nThe cast in and of itself isn't really terrible per se. For most part, they're just rather meh beyond some truly bleh archetypal villain characters. The main characters are exceedingly childish though, which is aggravating. Not to mention that they're pretty comfortable in their typical character roles for most part, such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cgirl\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cdumb brute\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Next to no one is particularly well written, which is a shame since some come close. Victor becomes a surprisingly good character in the second half of the show with his particular hang-ups. The antagonist that truly reveals himself in episode 10 is interesting as well, trying to find out why humans are so weird and capable of doing things that go against what he thinks are their personalities and morals. These were executed sort of well, so the fact that the cast is otherwise pretty bad is a letdown. Mina is especially repetitive with her \u00e2\u0080\u009cdarling\u00e2\u0080\u009d shtick and so is her and Victor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shtick of mocking Kiri for being a virgin. The running gags here suck and they hinder the already poorly written characters, as if the fact that they constantly beat us over the head with their shtick and this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s themes didn't do that already. \n\nA: 3:10 PM\n\nProject No.9 was in charge of this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s production, and they did not do very well here. By 2017 standards, the art looks decent overall despite some brilliant moments here and there. Character models are not always consistent and neither is the overall art quality. Animation-wise, it fares little better. The fights look ok at best despite the interesting powers at play. Unfortunately, they cannot always composite the characters well enough to the backgrounds because on rare occasions, they do a hideous job with the backgrounds during movement. The CGI makes that even worse. Honestly, the CGI kills any chance of the production values aspect being good. The CGI plane in episode 7 looks horrendous, the crazy Horologues are sometimes rendered in weird CGI that does not work at all in this context, and when they use cards or especially debris as CGI assets, and trying to play around with backgrounds in CGI for dynamic camera movement in fight scenes works about as horrendously as you'd expect, and it give me flashbacks to a series that will continually haunt me. Shame since the OP visuals look striking and visually ambitious and interesting, and without too much motion, the show can often look ok. Alas, this is what this show leaves us with at this current time of televised release, and it is not pretty. \n\nS: 6:10 PM\n\nThe OST is weird. The tracks are often repeated ad nauseam and in many cases, they wouldn't fit. However, sometimes the tracks were actually good and worked well with the scenes. It's a similar case to the Big Order OST (especially with the jazz stuff that seldom fits), except this doesn't have a real standout track. The OP, \"RULER GAME\" by Fo'xTails, is a pretty good OP and the standout piece of music for the show. It is fun and catchy, getting you pumped for the admittedly weak at best journey ahead. The ED, \"Jikan wa Mado no Mukougawa (\u00e6\u0099\u0082\u00e9\u0096\u0093\u00e3\u0081\u00af\u00e7\u00aa\u0093\u00e3\u0081\u00ae\u00e5\u0090\u0091\u00e3\u0081\u0093\u00e3\u0081\u0086\u00e5\u0081\u00b4)\" by Nagi Yanagi, is as weird as the OST. I am not a fan of the first half but the second half is pretty decent all things considered and made an especially good send off to episode 1. Lastly, the track \"One More\" by Tea, in episode 12, which plays in the best moment of the show, is a brilliant emotional piece, far better than the rest of the OST in the show. The music in this show is overall a mixed bag, and given how it was great at times, that's a real shame.\n\nE: 5:10 AM\n\nThis was a weird experience to be sure. It was often mildly annoying and its constant holes and asspulls got on my nerves. However, that Halle's me celebrate even more when the show manages to do something right with a twist or a particular plot point. It was a mediocre time all around with everything else leaving little effect on me on the whole. Regardless, this is one I cannot safely say I enjoyed too much despite a few great moments and an all-around superior second half.\n\nO: 4:10 PM\n\nThere is a good show buried underneath this. There really is. It's a shame that it undercuts itself with a lot of stupid decisions early on that poison the series as a whole, because this was definitely trying to be a worthwhile show. The feel of it is comparable to Big Order and Hand Shakers, but let it be known that it is nowhere near as awful as those to shows at all, not in any department. Regardless, I would not recommend this show to people unless they really find the concept interesting and don't care too much about blatantly bad storytelling. It's some sort of tragic irony that it ends up in a desperately poor state due to stupid decisions that led it down the wrong path, just like many of the grieving characters in this show that wish for their time back. Regardless, it's time we look to the future with even better (or worse) anime headed our way. With all that said, I bid you adieu."}, {"id": 3277, "score": 30, "body": "Yukinari Sasaki is a lonely young boy. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s small for his age, called puny and teased by most people he knows, and t make matters worse, he lives alone in a large, empty house. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always been considered something of a joke to the opposite sex, as girls are the ones who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done most of the teasing, and the only woman who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ever kind of liked him is the girl next door, the tall, busty brunette beauty who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s built their bond on busting his balls for bumbling in on her bathing in the buff, Kirie Kojima. If that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bad enough, his regrettable rapport with the fairer sex has resulted in him developing a previously unknown medical condition\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Whenever he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s touched by a girl, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a violent punch or a tender embrace or anything inbetween, he breaks out in hives. He is, quite literally, allergic to girls, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing he can do about it. Rather than transfer to an all boys school or hole himself up in his house and n ever come out, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s instead elected to go through life without complaint, dragging his feet though his own little world of depression and dejection.\n\nThat is, until he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite literally beaten out of that world. One day, when he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unfortunate enough to come home and catch Kirie naked in the process of preparing to take a shower, his naughty neighbor turns nasty, delivering a powerful blow that propels him through a magical portal in the bathtub, which connects him to a strange world that I guess is supposed to be the beyond portion of Bed Bath and Beyond. He winds up in the tub of a pink-haired air-head who, through some miracle, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trigger his allergies. It turns out they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on a planet in another dimension called Seyren, where women outnumber men at a whopping 9-1 ratio. After escaping the threat of rape from the general community, Yukinari is helped back through the portal by this strange girl, who magically goes through with him! As it turns out, dimensional travel is going to be the least of his problems when his liaison with this looney love-interest is going to turn his world upside down, one unpredictable mishap at a time.\n\nAIC Spirits is a production company I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve somehow never mentioned before, even though they did some of the work on Petite Princess Yucie in collaboration with Studio Gainax. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re extremely hit-or-miss, and while I have seen quite a few impressive projects from them, the overwhelming majority of it is cheap, badly managed, and with excuses of \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dated\u00e2\u0080\u009d dwindling through the years. They did almost the entire Tenchi line-up, if that gives you some idea of what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working with. If I had to put a pin in what kind of company they are, or some kind of defining thread throughout their work\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And keep in mind, this is an extreme generalization based on what little of their work I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They tend to put more money into a project if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not something that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be a guaranteed success. Popular name-brand shows and shows with excessive fanservice and nudity often get the shaft, while more out-of-left-field titles like Bamboo Blade, Now and Then Here and There, and Humanity has Declined get much more attention paid to them. Which side of the scale does Girls Bravo fall on? Go ahead and guess.\n\nI wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily call Girls Bravo an ugly show, but if it had a good personality to speak of, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d try distracting you towards that. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always look bad, but it never really looks good, either. The characters seem to be drawn to type, with the same basic characteristics you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come to expect from the harem genre, only exaggerated and over-the-top, almost like parodied caricatures of the classic tropes. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an obvious lean towards moe, with almost all the female characters sporting giant boobs and even bigger eyes, which take up more than half of their round, cartoony faces. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something distinctly unattractive about the way everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drawn, and while I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite put my finger on it, but I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come had this problem so badly since Ookami-san. There isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a hint of inspiration in anyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s design, and the similarities that Miharu bears to certain other magical girlfriend characters is way too distracting. Even the loli character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little mascot alien pet, which would normally serve as a mascot in other shows, looks generic as hell here.\n\nThere are some moments that I guess were animated okay, as short bursts of inspiration are really the best thing about this title, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to that later. I also really can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s poorly directed, as outside of certain fanservice scenes, it at least knows basic things like what to focus on and how to frame a shot. When it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing something weird, and dare I say at times even interesting, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not too bad looking. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost like\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 No, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll save that for later. The fluidity of movement isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t terrible, but it hits jarring low points whenever there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something else happening in the episode to compensate for, like CG water or a fast paced action comedy scene or what-have-you. The nudity isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always forced, as it often happens when characters are bathing or changing, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still very clearly designed to be sexually appealing to the viewer, which it fails at to a stunning degree. Not only does the sheer amount of it cause a dulling effect, creeping farther and farther into sensory overload, but it looks like crap, with the female characters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 breasts often looking sloppily drawn with poorly placed nipples. As far as ecchi titles go, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty pathetic in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s delivery.\n\nThe music is, surprisingly enough, really really good. A lot of it is your standard upbeat background fare that loops while fading into the background, but even those tunes are inexplicably pleasant to listen to, upbeat and ear=wormy but with a touch of class that you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find anywhere else in this series. Some of the cringiest moments in the series have beautiful, inspired tracks to accompany them, such as the Tito Puente-esque romantic struggle ballad that plays when Miharu is fellating an entire shop\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth of bananas. You wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe how many of these tunes I wound up dancing to when I heard them out of context for the sake of this review. They range from funky South-American style orchestrations to more relaxing Japanese style tracks, to fucking classy shit with violins. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a shame to hear such great music being wasted on such a trite series, but if that bothers you, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry, the opening actually kind of sucks. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s generic as all hell, both in terms of visuals and sound, and it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even remotely compare to the rest of Noriyasu Agematsu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work on the project, including the cute, bubbly head-bopper of an ending theme.\n\nThe english dub isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite as good as the music, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still better than it really needed to be. Michelle Ruff takes her role as Miharu to heart, and here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another example of why I consider her to be the greatest female voice actor of all time\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 She actually succeeds in making Miharu likeable. This is not an easy thing to do, as Miharu is only a few steps above being classified as a child with big boobs, one of the most unfortunate tropes in anime history, but Ruff just makes her sound so damn charming with her air-headed but well meaning approach. Another stand-out is the legendary Liam O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien in the role of series antagonist and gropey blonde fop Fukuyama, quite possibly one of the ickiest and least likeable characters in anime history, but lordy, does he just go to town with it. He plays the character like he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s James from Pokemon, but with his libido cranked up to eleven and his sense of boundaries and moral decency cranked down to negative one, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not hard to tell he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s having the time of his life with it.\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to make a sad sack like Yukinari likeable, but at the very least, Yuri Lowenthal keeps him from becoming annoying or whiny-sounding, which is the direction he could have very easily been taken. He plays him appropriately meek and depressive, but is still able to light a fragile little fire in the character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart when needed. Carrie Savage is cast to type in the role of Koyomi, Hunter Mackenzie Austin is okay but largely unremarkable in the role of Lisa, and then we have the two sour notes in the cast\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The mysterious J Ray plays loli anklebiter Tomoka, and while I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give her a squeaky or highpitched voice, that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make the voice they DID give her any more listenable. I hate to sound mean, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really mind the fact that this reclusive actor only ever did three roles. Stephanie Sheh plays Kirie under the false name of Lulu Chiang, and good God is she awful in it. I almost don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to believe such a great actor could have turned in such a badly acted role. Well, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said before that every great voice actor has at least one terrible role, and I guess this is hers. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still an okay dub over-all, though.\n\nSo\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Here we are again. Here we are, talking about another harem anime. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d really like to think that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be done with this genre eventually, because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re starting to blur together in my mind at this point. And yeah, I know, I choose the anime I review, but this time not so much\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I did a poll on Facebook, listing five romantic comedy anime I could review next, with Girls Bravo in there for shits and giggles, but lo an behold, it won by a landslide. I guess this is how the Republican Party must have felt with Trump, so like them, here I am committing whole-heartedly to the joke candidate. I should mention that my last poll-winner was spice and Wolf, so in a way, I trusted this group of idiots. They could have voted for Mysterious Girlfriend X, which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been waiting for years to give a February slot to, and it was in fact the second place entry, but no, I had three freaking people writing in their own options instead. Stupid Facebook polling system. Well, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very well jump to an alternate timeline, so we might as well get this over with.\n\nOnce you get past the terrible animation, which I have to admit is my main problem with this title, the product itself, from a writing perspective, is just kind of dull. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably a weird thing to say about such a universally disliked title, but what else can I say? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest crime is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s generic. It borrows conventions and design aesthetics from other iconic anime, as well as from the legions of other anime like it. Right from the first episode, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to not recognize it as a half-hearted rip-off of Ah My Goddess, and that goes beyond the design of Miharu. The premise directly involves a down-trodden, spineless male character who can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t catch a break getting the perfectly loyal female companion from another world, where her sister as well as several other ladies soon also come tumbling out to visit. The difference is obviously that we actually get to see this other world, and that the relationship between them isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t strong enough or ever seriously tested enough to be considered the main plot.\n\nOther than that, this series is painfully generic. The magical girlfriend genre is ubiquitous enough to be called a genre in the first place, but very few titles follow in the footsteps of Chobits by actually doing anything new with it. Like I pointed out in my old Love Interests post, if the main character is male, the main girl is often the first girl, as long as the first girl isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a childhood friend, who has as much a chance of winning the protagonist as the Buffalo Bills do of winning the superbowl. See? Not even in contention. On top of that you have overused ideas like the precocious loli girl, the prim and proper shy girl, the sex obsessed other dude, the fists as forethought girl, and of course, the probably blonde and probably rich girl who somehow mistakenly believes through sheer coincidence that she and the main character are engaged to be married. Oh yeah, and of course, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a cuddly little animal/alien mascot. I guess I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not being entirely fair here, because only three of these girls are actually interested in Yukinari, but hey, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m only reviewing the first season. Who knows what happens after that.\n\nThere are two ways that this series manages to stand out. First of all, two of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s characters actually manage to leave enough of an impression to defy convention and be more or less memorable. Unfortunately, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll remember them for all the wrong reasons. The first one is Kirie, the chick with the fists who we meet properly first. Actually, her first introduction tells you all you need to know about her character; Yukinari goes home, walks into his own damn bathroom, and catches her about to step into the shower, so she beats the shit out of him. Yeah, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s totally his house, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never explained why she has a key to it, but these things never cross her mind, because she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too busy executing wrestling moves on people while telling them what they can do in hell. Even Naru in Love Hina had more personality than this. In terms of her character, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not so much a person, as she is warthog that suddenly gained the powers of human speech and limited complex thought. She is one of the two characters in this show that make me hate my life(Tomoka is a close third), and I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m saying this, but she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually the better of the two.\n\nOn the other side of the fence, we have Fukuyama, the terror of Yukinari\u00e2\u0080\u0099s school and the antithesis of his character, as he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so perverted and girl crazy that he breaks out into hives when MEN touch him. If Kirie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a warthog, then I guess you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d call Fukuyama the Japanese version of a squid\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And yes, I mean the tentacle hentai version as well as the culinary version that tries to brainlessly wiggle down your throat. There are a lot of perverted playboys in anime, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of a thing nowadays, as every male main character must have at least one hopelessly girl-crazy friend to make them seem cool and approachable by comparison, but Fukuyama isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like most of these characters. The first thing we ever see him do is directly lift up Kirie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shirt and grope her boobs right in the middle of school. He uses his wealth to create erotic opportunities for himself, constantly gets back up for more after being pummeled for his rapiness, and oh yeah, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pedophile. I know he kind of redeems himself by helping Tomoka out at one point, but later when her animal companion is turned into a little girl, he abducts her and makes innuendo-laden remarks about having sex with her.\n\nThese two characters are painful enough to watch alone, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re even worse when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re together. You might imagine it would be cathartic to see the punchy girl get constantly groped, or the gropey dude get constantly punched, but all together all their interactions just feel icky and uncomfortable. It feels kind of like they deserve each other, but at the same time, it also feels like the series itself deserves to not have either of them in it. The only thing I kind of liked about Fukuyama was his relationship with his sister Lisa, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably the only character I liked in the whole cast. She got cast as the rich blonde girl with the marriage complex, but she actually has an interesting gimmick and backstory, and she almost makes Fukuyama likeable in the way their dynamic works. They actually feel like a pair of siblings, with neither one pining or obsessing over the other (THANK FUCKING CHRIST) and generally ignoring each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quirks and proclivities unless they find they have a reason to work together towards a common goal. If I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hate Fukuyama himself so much, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d probably have put them on my favorite siblings list.\n\nAnd speaking of Lisa, she actually brings me to the second thing about this series that stands out, and it actually helps it to do so in a good way\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 This show is really freaking weird. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not saying it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weird like most shows are weird, with a bizarre premise and string of gags and ante-upping reveals that eventually get dull, like in Hare + Guu. No, this weirdness is weird even by weirdness standards, and it actually kind of feels like genuine, non-manufactured randomness on the part of the writers. There are moments throughout the series where it feels like they just got bored with what they were writing or animating and just did random things to keep themselves entertained. None of it has any purpose, most of it is largely self contained and inconsequential, and it almost has me convinced that someone involved with this project\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Or, hell, maybe everybody\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 were aware of the fact that the series they were making was going to be shit, so they channeled that dude who put a dick on the Little Mermaid VHS cover and just went the extra mile to make their creative child as weird as fuck.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gotta be honest, these were the moments that kept me going. These made the series interesting. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen a ton of anime hot springs episodes, but for no reason at all, the first hot spring this cast visits was dried up and full of alligators and bananas. The pathway to Fukuyama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house is a hedge maze full of booby traps and military drones. An entire episode revolves around Miharu drinking an unlabelled liquid during science class(because she is a well endowed toddler, after all) and getting drunk off of it, which makes her spawn thousands of shadow clones that go on a hunger fueled rampage throughout the town, in a genuinely good episode that I like to call \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Nomming Dead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s episodes like these that makes Girls Bravo feel like some care actually went into it on some level. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ironic to think, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mastered the art of giving a fuck by not giving a fuck, and keep in mind, this is the kind of impression you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get when one of the main characters is fellating a bunch of bananas. And yeah, it actually manages to be funny from time to time, which is a welcome distraction from generic it all is.\n\nGirls Bravo was originally available stateside from Geneon entertainment, but copies of it from that company are completely out of print, although you can find them fairly cheap on Ebay. Thankfully, it was rescued by Funimation, and is available in a much more affordable slim pack. All releases also contain the second season, which I barely remember, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pretty sure it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more of the same fare. The original manga is available stateside from Tokyopop, which of course means it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also out of print. A visual novel for the PS2 entitled Romance 15\u00e2\u0080\u0099s is, surprise, not available stateside.\n\nI remember watching this series when it came out ten years ago, and thinking it was one of the worst things ever. Now that I watch it again after all these years, however, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s honestly not that bad. I mean, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get me wrong, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really bad, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not unwatchable. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d even go as far as to say that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better than a lot of later entries in the genre, like Haganai and Maken Ki. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not an overall enjoyable show, but as long as the two characters we discussed earlier aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t making my life miserable, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a generic, badly animated harem anime, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve become kind of numb to those. Yukinari and Miharu are almost even a likeable couple, at least once in a while. There really isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much here to justify a recommendation, especially since it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more like a bunch of random things that happen than anything even remotely resembling a plot\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I mean, come on, even Lucky Star had more of a story than this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But it kind of is worth checking out just for the random, bizarre spots that feel almost, dare I say, inspired. At the very least I can recommend you seek out the soundtrack, even if you wind up understandably giving the series a pass. I give Girls Bravo a 3/10."}, {"id": 3286, "score": 45, "body": "Hype can be a fickle thing when it comes to seasonal anime. At first it allows fans to get excited and anxious for the next episode, but majority of the time it ends up with many feeling somewhat disappointed with what they had been watching. This can be attributed to the fact that only one episode is released per week, and this week-long wait between episodes is a breeding ground for die-hard fans to praise a show as one of the best anime after only having seen a couple episodes. You only have to see the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Top Anime List\u00e2\u0080\u0099 on MAL to see that whenever you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re reading this, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably at least one show currently airing that snuck its way onto the list, only to slowly drop off once hype dies down and reality sets in. At one point I was a victim of this mentality, but now after experiencing disappointment as a result, I see hyping up a show like this as asinine, often leading to impairments in judgement. Erased, a Winter 2016 anime produced by A1 Pictures is one of the best examples of this: before the halfway point of its runtime, Erased had managed to capture the #4 spot on MAL\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Top Anime List, a feat I have never seen any other weekly seasonal anime do. And as I am writing this it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even in the Top 50 anymore, with many of its top reviews being negative; truly a fall from grace. So, looking back at show over a year since it ended, here are my thoughts on Erased:\n\n__*EDIT: SPOILERS ABOUND, BEWARE IF YOU LIVE UNDER A ROCK AND SOMEHOW HAVE NOT WATCHED THE SHOW YET*__\n\nThe story of Erased follows Satoru Fujinuma, a struggling manga artist in his twenties living a rather dour life, having to work a pizza delivery day job to make ends meet. However, Satoru has a supernatural ability called \u00e2\u0080\u0098Revival\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that causes him to travel back through his own time, usually only by a couple minutes, allowing him to stop any accidents or disasters nearby. The catch is that Satoru\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time-travel ability works out of his control, being the setup for the premise of Erased. By the end of the first episode Satoru finds his mother murdered at his house, and is quickly framed as the prime suspect. This chain of events causes Revival to activate, sending Satoru 18 years into the past and back to his 10-year-old child self. Seeing this as a sign, Satoru uses this opportunity to prevent the abduction and murder of three young students at the hands of a serial killer, starting with the first victim, Kayo Hinazuki. The premise alone is nothing special and somewhat contrived from the start, but the way it is presented through great visual direction along with setting up an important mystery element in the murderer/serial killer leaves viewers eager to see how things will unfold.\n\nEpisodes 2-4 are what I consider to be the highlight of the entire show. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in these episodes where we see Satoru attempt to save Kayo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fate through befriending her when no one else would. Kayo is cold towards everyone due to domestic abuse from her mother and her overall troubled life at home, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no surprise that she does not care about Satoru\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempts at friendship initially, but Satoru remains committed and continues to pursue her. The process takes some time but she slowly opens up to Satoru and sees him more like a real friend as time goes on. The 4th episode also leaves us with a cliff-hanger regarding Kayo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safety; was Satoru successful in stopping Kayo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fate? Or was all his effort still not enough to change the past? The character interactions, atmosphere and overall direction all worked well here, drawing more viewers into the world, the relationship between the two leads and Satoru\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal. The supporting characters also get some shine on screen, with Satoru\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother Sachiko and his teacher Gaku slowly getting more involved in the main plotline, as well as his friend Kenya who seemed to know more about the story than what a boy his age should have. Characters still need more development, questions still need answering and they could use some more exploration overall but from the great setup so far, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not surprising that fans were excited for the series and what would happen next. Sadly, this was the highlight of the show, meaning what would happen next would be when the series starts to fall.\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revealed in episode 5 that Kayo did in fact go missing, and Satoru having failed to change the past is brought back to his own time, still under suspicion of Sachiko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s murder and goes into hiding. He encounters Aira, his co-worker who believes him to be innocent and allows him to stay at her place. Aira was on screen with Satoru before the time-skip, even admiring him after seeing him save a child from being hit by a truck, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s here where her overall character is explored and, unfortunately, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not much to go into. Airi and Satoru have a conversation about how she can trust him and she reveals how her parents divorced over the theft of a chocolate bar, this being one of the dumber explanations in the show overall. Regardless, from using that awful example she states how she has conflicting thoughts when it comes to believing in people and their motives. This could have been an interesting concept if explored into, but that never happens, and that seems to be a common nuance I have with the show overall. It has these interesting concepts and elements that could have the series more interesting and deep, but they all end up being undeveloped, underwhelming and a waste of potential.\n\nThe writing only gets worse from here. Satoru activates Revival through sheer willpower and reverts back to his child form soon after he is found and arrested by police, and with this second chance he intends to do everything he can to stop Kayo from being kidnapped. His actions go so far as to \u00e2\u0080\u0098abduct\u00e2\u0080\u0099 her himself and attempting to murder her mother. Both of these actions are pretty ridiculous, especially when you consider that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a 29 year old man that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing this, not a child. Eventually he returns her to her mother, who reacts violently towards Satoru and Sachiko, going so far as to try and kill Sachiko with a shovel. Now it is obvious that Kayo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother is a loon that needs more than just counselling, but I find it annoying how she was previously shown to have gone through all the trouble of making sure her abuse wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t noticeable, given that she was shown to have almost struck her daughter while in the company of other people. Through poor writing as the plot progressed, she proved to only be a one-dimensional villain; a mere caricature that ultimately holds no merits. Unfortunately, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the only one who turns out like this.\n\nIt is at this point where I see the story start to turn into shambles. Because of her mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions, Kayo moves away to live with her grandmother and away from Satoru, and with that subplot finished, Satoru begins on working to save the lives of the other two abductees. So far the show was loved by many at this point because of the progression of Satoru and Kayo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship and their individual development; Kayo learning to open up to others and Satoru never giving up on others. It was a cute friendship with hints of romance that swooned the anime community with its cute charm and visual guise. So when one half had left the show, it made many viewers feel like their investment had been somewhat wasted, myself included. However, there are more problems that stem from this change of focus, mainly in regards to the characters. The other two victims are Hiromi Sugita, one of his classmates, and Aya Nakanishi, a student from a neighbouring school and viewers learn next to nothing about either character. While Kayo was never the pinnacle of character development by any means, she mattered so much more to the overarching plot than Hiromi and Aya. It is so obvious that they are nothing more than replaceable characters to make Satoru look more heroic and likeable. Other supporting characters are also left lacklustre, with much of their rationale turning out to be, ironically, irrational. Kenya, one of Satoru\u00e2\u0080\u0099s classmates, is perhaps the biggest example of this, seeming to be a character that was far more intelligent than he initially led on. But he just ended up getting shafted by poor writing, like most of the other characters in the show. The best character by far is Sachiko, and the reason why is because all of her actions are completely logical as well as the fact that beyond episode 1, she is never really explored, thus never even having the chance to get screwed up unlike everyone else. \n\nBut there is one character that stands out from the rest by just how awful he was utilized, and that is the real culprit; the man that abducted Kayo 18 years ago, and in present-time killed Sachiko. That man was revealed to be none other than Gaku Yashiro, Satoru\u00e2\u0080\u0099s homeroom teacher. This revelation is made in episode 10 to Satoru minutes before his apparent death by being trapped in a frozen lake. This moment had any sense of shock or suspense completely absent because no one who watched this show was even surprised! The killer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s identity is so obvious that it destroys any element of mystery \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which it was initially marketed as \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and does not help the show in any possible way. It only takes a couple episodes to figure out who the killer is with the blatant foreshadowing, and even if by some chance you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t realise it then, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s simple process of elimination. Just ask yourself \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhich characters look like the killer?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably only one person that comes up. Another issue I have with the character is how he is presented as a mastermind for half the show, seemingly omnipresent and always throwing the blame to someone else. But towards the end, he turns into this incompetent idiot so drastically that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s laughable. Gaku being caught as the killer is also incredibly stupid to the point where you legitimately cannot take the series seriously anymore. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as if his entire development jumped off a building ala Satoru in the last episode. Terrible\n\nMatter of fact, the entire ending is terrible and leaves a sour taste in the mouths of even the most die-hard fans. From the lead up with Satoru being in a coma for 15 years, to the final moment where Satoru and Airi meet again, it is all so contrived and full of plot holes that makes me wonder just what the original writer was thinking. Satoru becoming a successful manga artist afterwards because he \u00e2\u0080\u0098found himself\u00e2\u0080\u0099? I call bullshit! It left so many questions unanswered and decided to go for a \u00e2\u0080\u009chappy ending\u00e2\u0080\u009d than anything realistic, sacrificing what was left of any good writing and revealing its true colours as a show that at its core, was just emotionally manipulative. Its comparable to a slap in the face to those who wanted to know more about the world and the people in it, but perhaps the biggest problem I had most of all was how it completely ditched the concept of Revival.\n\nThe very first thing that intrigued me about this show was the Revival ability. While I did care about other features of the show later on, I was always thinking about the concept of it and how it could be explained. Time travel is in no way a new concept when it comes to anime, and the notion for it in this case seemed to just be a simple plot device to move the narrative along, but with time, effort and proper focus, could have developed into something more substantial. But as the show went on, the potential for this slowly dwindled down to false hope. At first, Revival only activates when an accident happens nearby, but on the fourth reset he was able to trigger it by yelling \u00e2\u0080\u009cGo Back!\u00e2\u0080\u009d with no accidents nearby him (of course, this had to happen the minute after the police had found him). And then they have the audacity to say Revival no longer activates once the real culprit is caught. What was even the point? The time resets were only used when it was convenient with all kinds of ways to trigger them, losing any sense of consistency by the end. \n\nWhen it comes to the visuals, Erased is consistently good with some breakout scenes here and there. The animation was done by A1 Pictures, a studio well known for their shows having a similar art style and while I can see many similarities to shows like Sword Art Online and GATE, Erased\u00e2\u0080\u0099s style feels more refined and unique. This is probably due to how the show tries to go for a more cinematic look; the animation techniques used really helped to intensify the plot and overall atmosphere. It has the kind of visual look similar to that of Mamoru Hosoda films, a kind of spectacle uncommon among the medium. The way Erased was also able to present character emotions, specifically Satoru\u00e2\u0080\u0099s internal conflict is certainly commendable; the kind of detail that is rarely seen in anime. However I do think the overall animation is somewhat overrated when it comes to symbolism. Both their handling and utilization of \u00e2\u0080\u0098red is dead\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and spider threads are rather poor, adding nothing to the actual narrative. When these literary devices are dumbed down so much, it should not be praised. Spoon feeding symbolism to viewers like they are all children is just lazy.\n\nThankfully, Erased does manage to excel when it comes to its music. The soundtrack was composed by Yuki Kajiura, known for her great work on the music from Sword Art Online and Fate/Zero, but here her work feels somewhat unimpressive. Many of the tracks complement the variety of scenes they are in, but overall are fairly typical and generic, with one OST in particularly \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Only I Am Missing \u00e2\u0080\u0093 sounding more like a classic Ghibli track than otherwise. The OP and ED however, were definite standouts, with Re:Re being an upbeat catchy opening that was never skipped and the ending fitting the mellow undertones quite well. Both were well crafted and made the experience more enjoyable. The English dub overall was well done, with extra compliments for having Satoru sound the least anime-like of all the characters; a rare yet wise decision from the director. Not only was this choice helpful in making the story feel more special, but also helped make Satoru a more likeable and relatable protagonist. The sound effects were the most admirable part of the entire show, as throughout all 12 episodes it has some of the most technically proficient use of basic sound that A1 Pictures has ever produced: from the footsteps in the snow to the whistling wind. These little things made the most impact in my opinion as it further immersed myself into the story and overall experience.\n\nAnd thus, these are my thoughts on Erased. It set the standard quite high in the beginning, but this turned out to do more harm than good in the long run. I would still recommend the show as it is an enjoyable watch and tells a heart-warming tale of a man trying to save those he lost in the past. But that in no way correlates to a good show. For every aspect about how visually stunning the show is, lies a handful of issues and problems in the writing. And when it slowly exposed these flaws it was as if the show was a snowball rolling down a hill, gradually picking up more plot holes and contrivances overall. But when it hits the ground, it breaks apart under its own weight, leaving hunks of snow in its place. Children still play with what is left, until it slowly vanishes and disappears from the ground. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all sad the snow has left but only for a short time, as they all see right on the horizon another snowball starting to make its way down the hill. And just in time for the next season too."}, {"id": 3287, "score": 40, "body": "Copied from my MAL account: [link ](https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=283831)\n\n\nDarling in the FranXX is best described as a failed experiment, although that might not be entirely true in the sense that it certainly achieved widespread appeal and amassed a considerable following of its own. Through my own viewing experience, I can surmise that there was in fact no other goal in mind. Darling in the FranXX feels like little more than a vapid and desperate attempt to harness the influence and legacy of other anime, and does so clumsily with seemingly no intent of creating its own identity. Much of its elements are thoughtlessly replicated from successful shows such as Evangelion and Gurren Lagann, without an understanding of what made these elements work in their own respective titles. It handles these elements so incredibly poorly and with such naivety that it could almost serve as a parody of the material it takes after.\n\nThe main character Hiro in particular faces an internal struggle relating to self-esteem and a desire to be needed, not dissimilar to that of Shinji Ikari from Evangelion. But while Shinji was given a thorough introspective on his character to make him feel like a real human being, Darling in the FranXX makes no hesitation to skip over to the drama, expecting viewers to buy into it the moment it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s established. Hiro along with all the other characters doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel human in the slightest because his conflict is conceptual. Conflicts are not character traits; incessant monologuing on how Hiro wants to be Zero Two\u00e2\u0080\u0099s partner is not substantial enough to take priority over the action or, better yet, actual story and character progression. This is just one example of what Darling in the FranXX does wrong compared to the works it takes after, specifically Evangelion and Gurren Lagann. Both these shows did what was necessary to flesh their characters out before opening the floodgates on the drama. There was drama in those instances of course, but it was in relatively small doses and was mostly a side effect of character interaction and certain other events. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as if the writers of Darling in the FranXX wanted to take inspiration from Evangelion and to a lesser extent Gurren Lagann without having watched either of those shows to discern what made them work in the first place.\n\nMuch of why Darling in the FranXX fails as a character study or drama amounts to the basic issue that the characters are sorely lacking in depth, and likewise fails to so much as come close to the monumental standard Evangelion had set in stone. Evangelion arguably contains some of the most human characters in all of anime, for reasons that are apparently lost on Darling in the FranXX. Character interactions felt genuine and grounded, effectively fleshing out these characters as well as their relationships with one another. Much focus was put on how they each operated in the grievous environments they were confined in. No such introspective or chemistry is present in Darling in the FranXX despite there being similar conditions. Hiro and Zero Two\u00e2\u0080\u0099s want for each other, Ichigo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s jealousy, and the Parasites\u00e2\u0080\u0099 discovery of love all remain conceptual without any complexity or dynamic whatsoever. In other words, the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focus lies squarely on the destination with hardly any focus on the journey, which flies directly in the face of basic story writing. \n\nThe character interactions in general are often completely mundane and are taken more seriously than they have any right to be. Most of the time they hardly evoke anything that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t already known by the audience and are overblown to a sometimes cringe-inducing level. Once a singular concept is made apparent by a certain dialogue or monologue, subsequent interactions relating to this concept serve no purpose to the narrative apart from artificial drama. Ichigo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fixation on Hiro in particular has no effect on Hiro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arc nor his character, and only serves to spur more dramatic tension. Ichigo herself has no depth apart from her love and concern for Hiro, and the drama involving her once again remains conceptually the same with no complexity to warrant its screen time. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also funny how quickly her mind changes once things turn out to be fine in the end, as sees Zero Two \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor who she really is\u00e2\u0080\u009d. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hardly any dynamic present with any of the characters in Darling in the FranXX. Their traits all boil down to love or concern for one another or a singular goal of their own. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no events in between to further characterize them or challenge their beliefs. If you were to assemble a plot chart based on the events in each individual character arc on Darling in the FranXX, it really becomes apparent how barren the story really is, even compared to first-grade-level writing.\n\nThe characters in Gurren Lagann were hardly complex themselves, but the show excels in other areas which make moments with its characters so worthwhile compared to FranXX. For one thing, Gurren Lagann doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t excessively pile on drama where it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t belong. It recognizes that it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fit for any sort of cerebral commentary or psychological analysis, and instead focuses on making its characters charismatic and endearing, only prioritizing the characters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 internal conflicts when it was deemed necessary. Circumstances were introduced at a steady pace to keep viewers in tune with the adventure and understand the characters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 struggles. And the drama in the second half, although it had mixed reactions from viewers, is still arguably more plausible and impactful than Darling in the FranXX could ever manage. The show effectively set these characters as it let other elements run their course as the simple character arcs were left in the back seat. What results is very likeable characters within a captivating series of events which is all executed tremendously. Darling in the FranXX is too focused on its futile effort on making these characters sympathetic to make them appealing in any other way.\n\nWhat Darling in the FranXX holds in place of natural story progression is its world building. Much of the motivation held by the characters is the dark truths they find about their own world. This kind of story isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t uncommon, and The Matrix is perhaps the most well-known example of this particular setup. This was also the case with other anime like Ergo Proxy and Shinsekai yori which, unlike The Matrix, take the form of a long, continuous narrative. Where both these anime succeeded where Darling in the FranXX fails is how they made these narratives captivating as an actual storyline. Discovering these disturbing secrets had an effect on the individual characters. Their views on the world changed substantially, and sometimes even considered giving up because they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to have to endure more pain. Nothing of this sort ever happens in Darling in the FranXX. These discoveries don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t add to their character in any interesting or dynamic way. They just pile on more reasons for the characters to act against their society. Their goals remain exactly the same and they seem to persist without hesitation no matter how much of their anguish is displayed. The most it ever manages is short-term shock of the characters only to be brushed off immediately after.\n\nThe world-building itself doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fare much better. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a mish-mash of cliches and borrowed ideas that fail to surprise anyone with at least a moderate experience with sci-fi. The show also seems to be more focused on whipping up surprises and twists about its world than maintaining any cohesion. Many elements of its world remain underdeveloped as though they were hastily thought of as production deadlines were drawing near, which is honestly my exact impression.\n\nEven as flat as she is, Zero Two is the closest thing to an interesting character that this show has on offer, but fundamentally she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t act the way she should in the first act. All throughout she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been portrayed to be lonely, distrustful, and longing for someone who will give her comfort. And yet despite all this, she acts like a jolly, flamboyant, promiscuous exemplar who is far more easy going than any of the other Parasites in Squad 13. This was presumably done to make her more likeable, and possibly to juxtapose her descent into anxiety later on. But this comes off as artificial because of how illogical it is, and rendered completely implausible the moment an attempt is made to give her a tragic backstory. Consistent characterization is worth sacrificing a facade of a personality such as this. It's easy to see that if Zero Two wasn't like this at the start she wouldn't have the widespread appeal she does now, which I think ultimately reaffirms how poorly-thought-out her character really is overall.\n\nThis goes to further display how Darling in the FranXX is at odds with itself in regards to its tone as well as plausibility. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretentious take on sexuality is just one example; the show is littered with other things like this. Dr. Franxx is presented as noble, powerful, and ambitious individual with a lot of importance to the storyline. And yet the very first scene he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in is a comedic moment where he molests a co-worker, and with no repercussions I might add. Additionally, puerile sex innuendos run rampant in a show that clearly wants to be taken seriously in nearly every instance. They have a place in Kill la Kill, where they clearly mesh with the overall tone. And in Evangelion, symbols relating to sex and birth were deliberately nuanced, attributed to the varying conditions of the characters and evoking them indirectly, just as symbolism should. Darling in the FranXX\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach on this routine is designing the cockpits in such a way that puts both pilots in doggy-style intercourse. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a frivolous stylistic choice far more inane than anything in Kill la Kill and adds nothing of worth to the sort of themes it wants to get across. This image is seen frequently throughout the show, and makes it harder to get invested in whatever dire situation is in play. Whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible to collide the styles of Evangelion and Kill la Kill successfully and seamlessly, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say. I can say however that this is certainly among the worst ways of going about it.\n\nSexuality is supposedly a theme with the story and characters alike, but the way it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s handled feels a lot more like a means of falling back to basic anime tropes than any sort of meaningful take on the matter. Anyone familiar with the medium can understand what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m getting at here. Flustered male characters, embarrassed female characters, beach episode, you name it. One episode in particular encapsulates a pitifully juvenile boys vs. girls affair, which is handled quite poorly and serves as nothing more than a bare-bones teamwork lesson with fanservice thrown in the mix. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also preposterous is the fact that, despite that they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what sex is or what a kiss represents, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re somehow aware that nudity is inherently sexual. As it stands, Darling in the FranXX\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take on sexuality is about as cerebral and nuanced as your usual harem. The very implication of a theme relating to sexuality has no place here whatsoever, other than to seemingly mask its intentions as something greater than what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d find in a harem.\n\nMany people seem to think that Darling in the FranXX had lots of potential, and had the ability to easily achieve much more with what it had. Personally, I disagree with that sentiment. While I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say there was no hope for it to turn out better, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say that much potential was wasted. Almost every element of Darling in the FranXX feels bought off from other shows. It uses the visual design of Kill la Kill or any Trigger anime for that matter, the concept of fusing mecha pilots taken from Gurren Lagann, and the existential journey from Neon Genesis Evangelion. The only remotely novel concept in the show is how the FranXX\u00e2\u0080\u0099 take on the form of the pilot, which is little more than an aesthetic design and a rather uninspired one at that. Most elements in Darling in the FranXX are already present in many shows before it, and are handled much better. Much of the apparent potential within Darling in the FranXX has already been manifested elsewhere.\n\nI imagine most of the effort made in the production of Darling in the FranXX was put into the action sequences, which I can say are rather impressive. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re well-choreographed, fluidly animated, and have lots of energy to accentuate that trademark Trigger aesthetic. This is one of the few departments of the show which doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel as though it was soullessly bought off, but seems to have some degree of skill and diligence put into it. This quality might have amounted to something if any ounce of value in this department hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t already been bested by earlier shows, namely those made by Imaishi himself. In this regard you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already better off flocking over to those anime instead, and with much better story and characters at that.\n\nThe artstyle on the other hand is nothing more than a passing grade, and feels like a spinless compromise between that of Evangelion and Kill la Kill, topped with A-1 Pictures\u00e2\u0080\u0099 own flavor of blandness. The designs of the Franxx\u00e2\u0080\u0099 are quite standard and ordinary, contrary to the enigmatic and daunting look of the Evas. The character designs are reminiscent of Kill la Kill, only trimmed of any unique or endearing quality and reduced to an SAO-level of creativity. The only environments that look even remotely striking are the Plantations and the labs within them, which take an obvious inspiration to that of Evangelion. Their scheme of yellow and red lighting along with how well they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re animated certainly looks appealing, if not a weaker effort compared to Evangelion. Overall, the aesthetic department is a case of hit-or-miss. Whatever styles it takes from other shows, it just drops aimlessly hoping that at least a few pieces will fit well.\n\nThe best word to describe Darling in the FranXX as a whole is \u00e2\u0080\u009csuperficial\u00e2\u0080\u009d, from the very idea of it all the way down to its execution. Its ideas are already outclassed from the start and the end result doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even serve as a lesser alternative. There doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t appear to be any thought or consideration towards most of the elements, which presumably goes to show the thought process during the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s creation. I see little to no signs of this being made as a work of imagination instead of a means of garnering an audience through controversy and artificial drama. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pitifully boastful about its tacked-on themes, has fanfiction-level story writing, and completely disregards logic for the sake of viewership, with Zero Two yet again being a perfect example. Regardless of how shamelessly derivative its core ideas are, Darling in the FranXX was not beyond salvaging. It had its material, which could have been utilized to uplift itself from the mangled state it turned out to be in the end. It might not have been the best at any of what it had to offer, but at the very least it could have delivered a serviceable experience with possibly a unique flavor of its own. As it stands now, Darling in the FranXX has exhausted almost any reason to justify its own existence. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an effort, or lack thereof, that I feel nothing but contempt for. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly bear resentment or malice towards this show like so many others. I see this show as little more than a tragic accident, which I can only hope will fade away in the near future."}, {"id": 3292, "score": 0, "body": "I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to write much in the way of a fancy introduction for a \"review\" of Utsu Musume Sayuri, Striking Daughter, the kind of crap you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d find in one of Courage the Cowardly Dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nightmares or whatever you want to call this vomit-inducting smegma. I want to keep it straight-forward and easy to understand because honestly what the fuck\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. Literally! At first I was asking myself not only what in God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name was I watching, but what in the world would drive someone to make such absolute dog shit! This is the kind of weird shit that I thought was unimaginable; you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try to make this shit up, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just too far out there. And as I am here today, after the second and hopefully last time ever laying eyes on Utsu Musume Sayuri, I am still disturbed and traumatized by what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve witnessed. \n\nThis OVA is 3 minutes long and thank the Lord it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go any longer. It starts off with a zoom into these lines, similar to the 2nd opening to Kill La Kill, followed by some black mah-jong pieces flipping around the screen and already you can tell this is not going to be pretty. It cuts to this black tentacle that bends around and shit (I honestly thought at first it was just a black dildo) and we find that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s connected to this fuck-face called Sayuri, with captions \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis gotta be Sayuri\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Unfortunately it gotta be, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it? There is nothing about the design of this disgusting blob that I assume has some pretty bad genetic defects, from the dodgy eye to the bloody pinwheel on the side of its head.\n\nWe are then shown Hiroshi, who has his head INSIDE OF SAYURI\u00e2\u0080\u0099S HEAD, with hand motions as if he were playing a trumpet. If you were to tell me this was hentai, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I could argue with that. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s told by some fugly captions that Hiroshi apparently married into Sayuri\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family for reasons that in no way, shape and form can be considered realistic. On Hiroshi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lap is Sayuri\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Mama, who appears to be a Babushka doll attempting to deepthroat what I assume to be the long-ass genitals of, who would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve guessed it, Sayuri\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Papa. They all appear to be participating in what I can interpret as a poorly animated orgy. Yeah\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 this has got to be some kind of sick Asian porn. In the synopsis, it says that Sayuri is the daughter of a good family. Maybe they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just misunderstood, as this was made in Japan, but I beg to differ.\n\nOne minute into this, Papa tells Sayuri that her time has come\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 to strike. Strike what, exactly? Well, we're told that she is to strike some poor, masochistic, deformed thing, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s put itself in the position known as \u00e2\u0080\u0098doggystyle\u00e2\u0080\u0099, pleading to be struck. Sayuri slithers the finger up its butt crack (no joke) before granting it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wish and slamming the big black dildo straight down on its puny little ass, over and over again, until it falls unconscious. It says in the credits that the mother had been waiting for this day to come where Sayuri would \u00e2\u0080\u0098strike\u00e2\u0080\u0099. Why? Who the fuck cares? Certainly, not the creators of this shit, because they end it then and there. Nothing that was shown in this show makes any fucking sense! And they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even try to hide it!\n\nThis OVA is a pinnacle of complete garbage in the anime medium. It only goes for 3 minutes, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 3 minutes too fucking long! The story, the characters, the animation, the sound, all of it is awful, even at an amateur level. You will have wish you spent those 3 minutes on extra sleep, because there is nothing redeemable from this show. There are shows out there like Mars of Destruction, Boku no Pico, Pupa, etc. that are known as some of the worst anime to ever be made, and Utsu Musume Sayuri easily joins these others pieces of shit in the depths of anime hell. If I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t made myself clear thus far, here it is, in its simplest form: Fuck this show! On MAL currently it has a mean score of 2.10, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still too damn high. It is a 0/10. Overall, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a 0. If I used a raw score: It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a 0. If I had used the 3 minutes I had watching this shit to create some kind of convoluted mathematical formula to come up with the most objective score I could possible give, it would still be a MOTHER FUCKING ZERO!! And if you disagree with me on this, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fine, but I dare you to watch it and tell me otherwise."}, {"id": 3296, "score": 10, "body": "-Spoilers.\n\nThey say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a waste to live in the past, clinging to people you once knew and dreams you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve outgrown. To live in the moment, and make plans for your future, are the cornerstones of responsibility, and you can never truly grow until you embrace them. But what if the past IS your only hope for a future? What if the only person who ever loved you was a brief acquaintance from your childhood? What if the promise to reunite as adults, bound by a common goal that will ensure their love will one day last forever? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to find the idea of someone devoting their adult lives to such a fleeting moment of happiness laughable, at least until you meet Keitaro Urashima, a 20 year old loser with a heart of gold and a body that would put a crash test dummy out of work. As a child, he made a promise to a mysterious young girl with whom he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d shared an unexpected connection. Upon realizing that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d probably never see each other again, they vowed to one day get into the prestigious Tokyo University, a college that they heard has the power to keep loving young couples together forever. That actually sounds kind of romantic, right?\n\nWell, it loses some of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s luster when Keitaro, as an adult, has decided to work around his pesky undatability by holding onto this 14 year old promise well into his early twenties, optimistically believing that the love of his life is waiting just beyond the entrance exams of Tokyo University\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Exams he has no hope of passing. Yeah, his ambition would probably be an admirable trait if it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t involve the Japanese equivalent of an Ivy League school, and even moreso if Keitaro himself wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t intellectually suited for, say, a for-profit school, or a community college at the very best. Nevertheless, he tries and fails, and when he refuses to set his sights any lower than the top, his parents realize with what I can only assume was dawning horror that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be taking care of their son for the long haul, and instead decide to ship his unemployed ass to the family hotel, Hinata Inn, to study while work as the building\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new manager! What they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell him, however, is that Hinata Inn has recently been transformed into a girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 only dorm, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home to a flock of ferocious females who aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shy about letting him know where his boundaries lie. With these tough temptresses attempting to murder him over every little misunderstanding, will Keitaro ever be able to chase his dreams, or will he be too distracted by the angry teenagers chasing him?\n\nLove Hina is a bit of a rarity in terms of production history\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It was animated by two distinctly different companies, Production IG and Studio Xebec, the differences between them being like night and day. Production IG has a reputation for showing us the best visuals that the current technology of whatever year it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s working in have to offer, and this was no less true in the year 2000. Xebec, on the other hand, is to animation what a child with a plastic steering wheel attached to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s carseat is to driving\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Except with actual control over the car. These two radically different agents mix about as well as oil and water, making it embarrassingly easy to tell who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behind the visuals at any given time. Now, to be clear, the animation in this show is never what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d call \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It clearly had a lot of budget issues to deal with, which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard is partially responsible for it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s failure to secure a second season before it got canceled. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s passable about half the time, with good old IG doing their damnedest to not let the series look as cheap as it was, and for the most part, it kinda worked. They did what they could to limit obvious corner-cutting techniques, animating character movements and framing conversations in such a way that key frames never become too oppressive, and awkward motion isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t too distracting.\n\nOn the other hand, we have Xebec, who did the rest of the series, and to say they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t handle the fickle nature of the budget as well as IG did would be a generous freaking understatement. I guess the best example of the kind of job they do would be episode 16, the Monkey King stage play. This episode doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just abuse key frame, it cuts back and forth between the SAME key frames, at one early point shooting it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main characters way out in the background, with the entire rest of the frame filled with a simple beach landscape, the tiny characters barely moving as it cuts back and forth between this frame and another slightly more interesting one. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eventually revealed that the reason these excessive shortcuts were taken was so Xebec could show some action scenes towards the end, which probably would have made it feel justified if it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for the fact that the action in question isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even all that great. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not terrible by any means, but even a novice animator knows that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not worth letting 90 percent of your anime look like crap just to save your budget for a few mediocre fight scenes.\n\nSo yeah, the worst thing you can say about the animation over-all is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inconsistent, but when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bad, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s painfully bad. The same can be said for the artwork, which\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Like the animation\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Is at best, passable. The backgrounds are serviceable enough, as while they never really feel detailed or immersive, and extras existing in the background never really move or feel lifelike, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never so bad that you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t imagine characters existing and living in them. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re fine. The characters, however, run into some serious issues here and there. While it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a consistent problem, I do recall several instances of characters appearing off-model, frozen in time, or having the incorrect bodily proportions. There was one particularly egregious frame towards the end where Naru\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little sister temporarily went from a normal middle school physique to an inexplicable D-cup, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not even at it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worse. Motoko, the swordswoman character, had her face altered for this adaptation in a way that makes her look almost frog-like in the early episodes. Thankfully, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really the only deviation from the original character designs that I noticed. Anyway, the artwork is largely fine, but any given time, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re only one rogue pause away from seeing what can only be described as bad fanart.\n\nBut you wanna know what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consistently awesome, unlike the visuals? The music. Love Hina has a fantastic soundtrack, with it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only real massive downfalls being the fact that you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really find all the sample tracks online, and the fact that several more recognizable tunes get recycled ad nauseum throughout the series. Not that the second issue matters, because the music is good, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll welcome opportunities to hear each track multiple times. Unfortunately, the best track only plays once. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a solemn piano piece that plays in episode 12 between the opening theme and the title reveal, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a classical track called Gymnopedies by Eric Satie. The rest of the music, which has been equally difficult to match names to, is overflowing with effort and personality, from the frantic upbeat songs to the beautiful insert songs that were all sung by the cast, and especially the more soulful tunes that get used for more sad or romantic moments. Songs dealing with individual characters carry the flavor of said characters, like Motoko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s traditionally eastern sounding themes and Kaolla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exotic ones.\n\nThe opening, Sakura Saku, could almost be considered an ode to the fast forward button, as it just feels\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Fast. from the song to the visuals, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an incredibly fast paced op where everything seems to be trying to catch up with each other. I get the feeling that this tone matches what Xebec and IG THOUGHT they were going for with this anime, but in reality, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really match the tone of either the original manga OR the final product. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like, this is the op they commissioned when they though the show they were going to create was going to be slapstick, zany antics and physical comedy all the way through. Having said that, as fast an OP as it may be, it also comes off as a bit lazy, as it recycles visuals from the show\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 A pet peeve of mine, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re wondering\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And otherwise introduces the entire cast through framed faceshots, a staple of the harem genre. Honestly, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pretty annoying op that I found myself skipping over and over. The ending theme is better, employing a slower and more groovy song as it slowly pans across a single still image of the main female cast on the floor covered in nothing but loose white sheets, and while it feels completely out of place, it at least pleasant in comparison. Although, yes, I skipped it just as often.\n\nThe English dub has actually achieved notoriety over how terrible it is, as I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen a single reviewer attempt to recommend it over the sub\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But honestly, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really all that bad. Now once again, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d call good, but several of the performances are at least accurate, and the ones that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t are the product of bad casting and direction, although even in those cases I can kind of see what the director was trying to do. To start things off on a relatively positive note, Derek Stephen Prince\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance is more or less what I hear in my head when I read Keitaro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dialogue in the manga, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s able to stretch what should be a throat destroying role to some pretty diverse places and situations. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good actor, but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really make up for how annoying Keitaro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice sounds both in my head and in the show. Marginally better, albeit on the same note, is Bridget Hoffman in the role of Shinobu, the shy middle schooler who had much easier role to perform. Her waify Yamato Nadeshiko pitch would be a bit too grating for the original Shinobu, but with the bulk of her character development either removed or straight up replaced, she fits the part nicely.\n\nWhen I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m having a discussion about bad, mediocre or middle-of-the-road voice actors, I always manage to shock the room by bringing up the prolific Wendee Lee. Yes, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s had her fair share of outstanding roles, but she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also been dragged down on too many occasions by poor direction choices that she just couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t manage to save. In Love Hina, she plays the energetic Kaolla Su as well as Su\u00e2\u0080\u0099s older sister Amalla in a dual role where she was asked to perform with an Indian accent\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Even though the character is not Indian, and the dialogue even goes as far as to blatantly STATE she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not Indian. Of course, there wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much available in the way of other options, and there really isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a known accent attached to her people in the manga, and to her credit, Wendee does pull it off\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 When playing Amalla. When her range is stretched too far by the combination of acting, using a difficult accent AND playing a hyper character, the end result is just terrible. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still better than Barbara Goodson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inexplicable southern drawl that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supposed to act as a substitute for the Kansai accent, but \u00e2\u0080\u0098better\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is a relative term here, because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re both virtually unlistenable.\n\nAnd if you thought my criticism of Wendee Lee was hard to take, wait until you hear Mona Marshall playing Motoko Aoyama. Good God was this an awful casting choice. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve criticized her before for having a little boy voice that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sound remotely male, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say the voice sounds like a natural woman, either\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And she uses that exact voice to play Motoko, the kendo-obsessed girl and my favorite character from the manga. Every single word that comes out of her mouth sounds like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming from the wrong person, like she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the sad victim of a rogue ventriloquist. Rounding out the rest of the main cast we have Julie Ann Taylor doing a fine job with Mutsumi, playing her appropriately as a klutzy airhead, and Dorothy Elias-Fahn as Naru. This is one of Fahn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two biggest credits, alongside Meryl Stryfe from Trigun, and to say the two characters are similar\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Shouting, critical nags attached at the hip to doofus heroes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Is a bit of an understatement, but since Naru isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as well-rounded or fully realized a character as Meryl was, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also the problem that she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really click with the character as fast. She enters the role as a stuck-up screaming Tsundere, but to be fair, she does settle into the role as best as she can as the series progresses\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Possibly even moreso than the character really deserves. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a dub that takes some tolerance and getting used to, but yeah, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no real reason not to watch it subbed.\n\nBefore I start to look more deeply at Love Hina, I should probably start by saying some things about it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s creator, Ken Akamatsu. As one of the founders of the modern harem genre, Akamatsu is a renowned mangaka whose works have been well received both critically and commercially, and his influence can be seen just about everywhere. He has seven unique titles to his name, but since Mao-chan started off as an anime, Kids Game is difficult to find and the less we say about Itsudatte My Santa the better, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to focus on the way his work has evolved over the course of four of his most well known works; AI Love You, Love Hina, Negima, and UQ Holder. The first thing that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to call attention to is that throughout his career, Akamatsu has had a penchant for inventive action scenes, PG-rated fanservice nudity, and deep, complex exploration of characters who seem at first glance to be nothing more than cheap tropes. Well those and all the weirdness, but the weirdness is largely unique to each title. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interesting to look at his body of work over the years, how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s changed from title to title, but the most easily trackable change comes with the theory that he uses his fanservice as a crutch to keep readers interested throughout the story.\n\nAI Love You was basically a rip-off of Ah My Goddess, with High School Keitaro in the lead role and Skuld being swapped out for a little boy. Not gonna lie, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty bad. The only thing it really has to offer is a generic slice of life story, disturbingly sexist undertones, and a lot of bare bottoms. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s follow-up, Love Hina, had lot more effort put into it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plot and story, with Akamatsu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trademarked fanservice put into a more consistent context and more practical use as other elements and themes were experimented with. When Negima came around, Akamatsu didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even want to make a harem, wanting instead to try his hand at the shounen action genre, so he worked around his contract by using a beefed up harem as the roots and origin of such a story. Since the shounen action and magical adventures wound up being the most popular aspect of Negima, he wound up creating his most recent effort UQ Holder, a sequel to Negima and a pure shounen action series whose occasional fanservice feels more like a half-assed obligation than anything the writer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really invested in. My point is, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grown as a writer, in maturity, craft, and many other areas. But Love Hina is still one of his earlier works, so you kinda have to expect an immature world-view going in.\n\nSince Love Hina is the work that made him famous, it is the one most synonymous with his name, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s achieved a sort of iconic status in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own right, particularly as a gateway manga for a surprising number of otaku from both sides of the ocean. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appeal can best be explained by the way it utilizes it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s target audience, teenage boys and those who think like them. It works the best on readers who are lacking in experience with anime, manga and sex, and unless you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already spent your youth on it, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a surprisingly easy story to grow out of. Young readers are sucked in by the promise of crazy comedy, sexy antics and the bare bottoms of seven radically different female characters\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But instead of just milking these impressionable young readers for cash, Love Hina introduces them to extended arcs, complex character writing, and a sense of conflict and themes that comes off as natural and never forced. For example, Keitaro and Naru aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just thrown together as the main prospective couple\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 In a house full of people who are only staying there to run away from something, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the only ones who are also running towards something, making them the most compelling members of the cast, and even when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re battling against the literal force of fate, you still wind up rooting for them. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot more to this manga than just fanservice and slapstick, and it stays with you years later.\n\nHow well does the anime translate these qualities? Well, let me ask you this; after writing more than sixty anime reviews, how many times did I break the review to talk about the manga the series was based on, and why it worked? I did that here because there are tons of reviews that will tell you Love Hina doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work, but I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really come across any that went into detail about why. The manga works because in between every big memorable moment, there are volumes upon volumes of character development and a very specific order to the events which unfold. Because of this, it represents the best of a lot of otherwise regrettable tropes. Shinobu is the best \u00e2\u0080\u009cnotice me sempai\u00e2\u0080\u009d girl, Keitaro is the best of the \u00e2\u0080\u0098obsessed over a childhood love\u00e2\u0080\u0099 characters, etc. Out of all the changes that the anime made, more of them being completely harmless than you might think, the absolute worst thing it did was rush the story, ignoring all of that glue and focusing solely on those big moments, and showing everything out of order. The characters are there, but the familiarity is gone. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no magic left in our bond with them, and with such terrible execution, nothing feels like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening at the right time. This is a devastating problem for a story with so many imperfections that it needed that glue to cover up.\n\nYou can argue until the cows come home about Ken Akamatsu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s level of maturity, but he was not a stupid writer. One of the biggest complaints anyone has about the anime is how much abuse Keitaro suffers at the hands of his love interest, which is a complaint that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t heard nearly as often from the Manga\u00e2\u0080\u0099s readers, despite it happening about as often. This is where fanservice comes in. In the manga, almost every time Keitaro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assaulted, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accompanied by either a peek at some panties or a flash of some flesh, and due to the static nature of a manga panel, the presumably 14-year-old reader has the option of lingering on the naughtiness, already perfectly framed, and then just glancing over the punch/kick/sword slash. In the anime, almost all fanservice is removed\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Hell, girls don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even enter the hot springs without towels until the halfway point! The abuse is left to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own devices, no distraction offered. This is why, among people who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve only seen the anime, the character of Naru Narusegawa has the unfortunate stigma of being despised by otaku the world over.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try not to give too many examples of the disastrous changes the anime makes, at least in the interest of avoiding spoilers, but there are some that must be addressed. Keitaro lying about being a Tokyu U student is supposed to be a major plot point, one where he digs himself in deeper with each interaction, but in the anime, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s swept under the rug soon after being brought up. Replacing the original Shinobu introductory arc with one that involves her parents feels forced and unnatural, especially since the most essential part of Keitaro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lie was the way it affected her. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an incredibly important moment during a beach storyline where Keitaro is screwed by his friends into royally pissing off Naru, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supposed to be a major speed bump between them that lasts three whole arcs, one of them being completely non-sensical for the sake of levity. Here, that levity arc is played first, and the initial friction arc is combined with another arc(that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been shifted to three other characters) before being abruptly resolved under some generic fireworks. There are several new characters added, including a new romantic rival for Keitaro, Motoko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s harem of admirers, and Naru\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little sister, but none of them add anything to the story outside of writers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 conveniences.\n\nSeveral new ideas, like Naru becoming an idol singer and Motoko dreaming she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in a fantasy RPG game, are just as pointless, and often confusing in their logic. Even when the anime does something genuinely good, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still dragged down by mistakes that are even worse. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a tight focus on the mystery of who Keitaro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s promise girl is, and the love triangle that blossoms from it is handled well, unless you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching the episode where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suggested that she might have just been a haunted ball joint doll. The effect Motoko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sister had on her life is explored thoughtfully, but we never actually meet her, so it ultimately falls flat. Kaitaro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incest crazy sister was thankfully left out, which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d give them major credit for if it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for the fact that A: She wound up getting her own movie and B: They wound up giving Kaolla and her siblings an incest episode that was even worse. The story wound up being incomplete because of budget issues that made it unfeasible to continue onto a second season, but if the right material had been cut, it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have been an issue. The three movies that followed didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do the ending justice, rather they just animated some popular storylines that were left out. Seeing how \u00e2\u0080\u0098Read the manga\u00e2\u0080\u0099 type endings have affected me in the past, you can guess what my thoughts on this one are.\n\nLove Hina was originally available from Geneon, and after they went out of business, it wound up being rescued and redistributed by Funimation. The original Geneon collections are still available online, such as the Complete collection set and the Perfect collection set, which includes the OVA episode and all three movies, or you can buy the two collections that Funimation has released\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 A thinpack box set with cover art that tried to make the material sexier than it actually is, and more recently an \u00e2\u0080\u0098Anime Classics\u00e2\u0080\u0099 collection that proves just how far they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re willing to stretch that term. The three movies can be found individually or in a box set, and while they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re technically out of print, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still fairly cheap online. The manga from Ken Akamatsu has been available stateside for so long that you can find the entire 14 volume set on Ebay for as low as 35 dollars, which is a deal I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d highly recommend. AI Love You is a bit trickier to find, and is thus a bit more expensive, even at only 8 volumes. A two volume light novel collection is also available stateside.\n\nThe word I feel best describes the Love Hina anime is incompetent. It does absolutely nothing right, and while it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fairly easy to tell that it respects the source material, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just as obvious that it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand the source material. The only episode that I found any enjoyment in was episode 12, which had me laughing out loud multiple times and sucked me into it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story, with a little help from the aforementioned music. Aside from that one exception, every single episode of this turkey is tied for worst, and they all fail in such unique ways that I could have reviewed every single one of them on it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own, had I wanted to. The comedy isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t funny, the romance isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t romantic, the drama has no stakes, the characters have no development, and I have the strangest feeling that they intentionally meandered throughout the entire run, thinking it was entitled to a second season that never happened, and were thus in no rush to reach any conclusion. I was willing for the longest time to give this title a few pity points, based on it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good intentions, appropriately goofy nature and killer soundtrack, but that incest episode just sealed the deal. I give Love Hina a 1/10.  "}, {"id": 3298, "score": 5, "body": "_\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is more than just a simple match; this is real drama and real excitement! I dare say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the finest form of entertainment in the entire world\u00e2\u0080\u009d_ \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Mariko \u00e2\u0080\u009cJackal\u00e2\u0080\u009d Toujou, in regards to the final fight in the series.\n\nDear Mariko, fuck off. Matter of fact, to everyone that was a part of the creation of this show, fuck off! This kind of shit is the reason why the general public sees anime as either for children or as some kind of sick animated porn, that probably includes tentacles. The latter is mainly due to the use of ecchi within anime shows. For those of you who don't know, ecchi is a genre in anime where playfully sexual actions are present within a show. I personally don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see ecchi as completely bad, as I have seen shows that have successfully integrated fan-service and lewd acts within a story, whilst not coming across as pandering to the audience (e.g. Prison School and Shimoneta). However, the main problem that I find with the ecchi genre overall is that most ecchi anime uses fan-service for exploiting the sex appeal of characters with the primary reason being to please the audience. This show happens to fall so far down the latter that I honestly think that the staff behind the making of this show have no shame whatsoever. And you know what? That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably right! So with that said I will have no problem with calling this show out on its absolute bullshit!\n\n*SPOILERS BELOW BUT I DIDN\u00e2\u0080\u0099T GIVE A FUCK AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU!!!*\n\nWanna Be the Strongest in the World is a 2013 anime series based off the manga of the same name and was produced by Studio Arms, the studio that made such disappointing and frowned-upon shows such as Brynhildr in the Darkness and Queen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Blade. They were also responsible for Elfen Lied, take that as you will. The show lasted for 12 episodes and was centred around teen pop singer and main star of the popular idol group \u00e2\u0080\u009cSweet Diva\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sakura Hagiwara, who becomes a professional wrestler to avenge her best friend and fellow Sweet Diva member Elena Miyazawa, as well as prove that pop idols can also \u00e2\u0080\u0098lay the smackdown\u00e2\u0080\u0099 when it comes to working in the ring. What makes this series so\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 interesting is that it belongs to the ecchi genre and therefore is obviously going to lean more towards the pervy side of the anime medium, but boy! The fan-service in this show is not just present, it is nearly everything that this show does. I am convinced that the people in charge of this show tried to shove in as much fan-service as they possibly could. Within the first 4 minutes of the very first episode, there is already a shower scene with the two main characters of the show, Sakura and Elena, naked, along with some other Sweet Diva members that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter, who are also naked. You may not know this, but both Sakura and Elena are 17 years old\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 That may shock you and make you feel a little bit bad about yourself, but Japan obviously doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give a fuck about that!\n\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even more insulting about this shit show is when it comes to the wrestling side of things. First off, the attire these women wear look more appropriate as swimming gear or what you would wear sliding down a stripper pole rather than wrestling gear. Just look at the cover of the show and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see the kind of outfits that these women wear. Their scantily-clad gear, accentuating the T&A of each wrestler to such a degree cannot be considered realistic, even for pro wrestling standards. Take one quick bump and we could very well have a wardrobe malfunction on our hands. Now I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care much about the objectification of women in this show, but there is no other reasonable explanation of why their gear is so skimpy than that the animators were banking on sex appeal to intrigue the audience and not much else. But this issue has nothing on the amount of breast, groin and ass shots repeated over the entire 12 episodes, coupled with moaning. Lots and lots of painful moaning. If you enjoy listening to the screams of curvaceous yet disproportionate women coming from your screen, this show might seem like a gift from God to you. However, after a while I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be surprised if you just got bored masturbating to Wanna Be the Strongest and decided to look up some hentai to get off on because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hentai you can find that has more variety of animation than this shit. The number of close-ups of breast and camel toes on this show is so damn excessive and unrestrained that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll probably start to relate to their parts more than the characters themselves. Even the number of boobs and vagina clips showed in the first episode, where pro wrestler Rio Kazama humiliates both Sakura and Elena can be considered tame compared to what is shown over the next 11 episodes.\n\nOne of the biggest problems this show faces is how it uses the concept of professional wrestling to move the story along. The end of the first episode has Sakura face Rio in a legitimate wrestling match after Rio earlier had beaten down and embarrassed her friend Elena at Berserk gym. Sakura tries to avenge her friends and is beaten in rather quick fashion via passing out to the Rear Naked Choke (a proper submission, but in this show, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s false advertisement). Sakura got rightfully schooled by the professional and even loses some of her hair as a result, but undeterred she vows to go pro to defend the honour of idols all around the world. She trains her body for three months before taking the ultimate test for rookies: the hellish hundred throws. Basically Sakura takes a total of 100 suplexes from Rio and some other pro wrestlers that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even matter, some of which share nearly the same character design as Sakura, the only differences being their hair and wrestling gear. After Rio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempts to keep Sakura down along with numerous shots of tits and ass, Sakura survives the challenge, which means that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ready to have her first match as a pro. So apparently, they just let you take a hundred bumps and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all you need. They didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother to teach her any technique or move-set or even the damn rules before throwing her into a match? We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re two episodes into the shit fest as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already a failure of a realistic wrestling drama.\n\nAnyways, Sakura has the first match as a pro and is beaten by being locked in a submission known as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cBoston crab\u00e2\u0080\u009d. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s alright since the fans still love her and happy that she gave it her all in that match, until she loses again, and again, and again, all to the same submission manoeuvre. Obviously she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always put in the Boston crab because the animators kept wanting to show us her \u00e2\u0080\u0098bust & crabs\u00e2\u0080\u0099. Sakura loses several matches in a row, gaining a streak like that of a common jobber and causes fans of her and the show itself to lose interest. Luckily for Sakura, the ace of Berserk gym Misaki Toyoda starts mentoring her and gives her the motivation to break out of the submission of her nightmares, and in her next match she does manage to break out of the hold, before immediately losing via pinfall. Wow, great progression. Meanwhile back at the idol group Sweet Diva, the group has practically become stagnant thanks to their star Sakura becoming a pro wrestler and tapping out to pros that have no development whatsoever. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m in bewilderment as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m writing this as to why on Earth did the creator want to make wrestling look realistic? It wants to be a sports drama so badly, yet events in the show and plot points go well beyond the line of ridiculous! If they chose to see pro wrestling as more of a scripted fight than an actual fight, then development wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have been such a huge issue and they could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve explored the different lives of idols and pro wrestlers a lot better. But the show doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t and would rather take the sport side of it very seriously, with added crotch shots and moaning in between. Fuck this shit.\n\nHalfway into the show, Sakura gets her rematch with Rio, the woman who humiliated her in the first episode, with no real build-up to it other than what happened in that first episode. That shit isn't how wrestling works but oh well, nothing in this show works. In the match, Sakura shows a lot more fighting spirit and refuses to give up, and even manages to hit her double-kick finisher to win the match in a huge upset, scoring her first victory. This could have been a strong moment for the series if they had bothered to show Sakura getting progressively stronger and closer to victory in her matches beforehand as well as actual build-up to the match rather than the half-assed execution we got. And another thing, every single match that we have seen from this show or ever will see all cut out the more acrobatic and entertaining parts of actual wrestling matches that are fun to watch, along with any chain wrestling to help wrestling get a feel for how the other wrestler works. All that we see are suplexes, strikes, holds and finishers, but with no reasoning behind them. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re performing moves just for the sake of performing moves. I guess all those submission holds used don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put much of a strain of the animation budget. Anyway, with Sakura achieving her original goal, she can go back to being a pop star, but she says that she wants to keep proving herself as a wrestler, much to the dismay of her best friend Elena and all of us who\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still watching the shit.\n\nNothing else of importance really happens till the final match so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just go there. While Sakura is facing other wrestlers that are literally there to keep Sakura occupied for a couple episodes, a new mysterious masked wrestler named Blue Panther begins taking out other wrestlers until she gets a match with Sakura, demanding that she retire upon losing. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at this point where she unmasks and reveals herself to be Elena, Sakura best friend from Sweet Diva. Her plan is to force Sakura into retirement so she can join Sweet Diva again. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know about you guys, but forcing someone to join a group through beating them in a wrestling match does not sound like the healthiest thing for a relationship, and it sounds like something that could come from the WWE storyline, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a good thing, cause WWE sucks. They have their match and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easily the best match from the entire show, actually showing ring psychology within the match. Unfortunately, the main problem with this match is with the animation. Overall the animation of the show is rather inconsistent, but the movement in this match especially is just downright shoddy and makes some of the moves shown looks unintentionally hilarious. Sakura took a damn Tombstone Piledriver (move where the opponent's head is driven into mat) and a second later her body started to twist and contort out of nowhere. The use of CGI on the crowd was also terrible and the crowd was shown on-screen for way too long, making the poor use of CGI even more obvious. This show also pulls one of the worst things I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen in an anime: they have Sakura pinned to a near-fall, but rather than showing Sakura kick out, they turn to a shot of the lights above the ring, and we hear some guy in the crowd say \u00e2\u0080\u009cWow, that was close\u00e2\u0080\u009d. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s times like like where I just want to facepalm in frustration with how shit like this is given a pass.\n\nThe match ends with Sakura winning the match. Elena is left heartbroken and pleads her friend to come back to Sweet Diva. The crowd chimes in with their opinion as well, oddly enough, and most say they want to see Sakura back in the idol group, despite cheering her for the last 11 episodes for pursuing her goals of wrestling. Eventually Mariko Toujou comes in and says that both Sakura and Elena can continue wrestling and be pop idols if they can handle it. Who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Mariko? We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get so her soon enough. The show ends with Sakura and Elena all dressed up in their idol gear, performing in front of the wrestling crowd, completely no-selling injuries that they sustained previously in their match. Hoo-ray, the end. Now after all of this I can easily tell you that this was one of the worst stories I have even seen played out in 12 episodes, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the only horrible thing about this steaming pile of horseshit.\n\nThe characters, oh my God! Despite the amount of characters in this show, not one manages to stand out as even average! Sakura, despite being the most significant character, is also one of the saddest excuses for a main character I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d call her the John Cena of the show, but at least John Cena has a personality. Throughout the entire show she struggles in every match, either winning by the skin of her teeth, or being dominated throughout the match. She wants to become the strongest and prove herself, but never once changes or has her morals challenged. They could have if say, they had her reflect on her losses, but they never even try that because the staff are too busy prioritising crotch-shots over character development.\n\nElena is next up on the platform of shame. This girl is both Sakura\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best friend and rival, always coming close to beating Sakura, but never beating her in anything. She is obviously jealous of Sakura\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accomplishments, bra size and overall success. Unfortunately she always maintains her place throughout the show, ending up one-dimensional. One thing I want to know though, how the fuck is this girl able to challenge and almost beat Sakura despite having barely any proper training over the duration of the show, compared to Sakura, who needed to train her boy up for 3 months before even getting a match? \n\nRio Kazama-You know what? Fuck this bitch. She doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter at all to the overall story. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a bitchy wrestler with a cocky attitude and no ass. NO ASS! Alright next character is Moe. Moe is a high school freshman who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the granddaughter of a former wrestler and who was inspired to start wrestling through watching Sakura. This girl is only important for one episode where she faces Sakura purely to keep the show going. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easily replaceable and her only memorable act in the entire show was motorboating the main character.\n\nAnd then, there was Mariko \u00e2\u0080\u009cJackal\u00e2\u0080\u009d Toujou. This woman happens to be the world champion, and yet, she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter at all when it comes to the story. She faces Sakura in the second half of the show because her original opponent was injured, but if you had replaced this woman with some random wrestler, the show wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have changed at all. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just another pair of tits to get off to when you get bored of Sakura. But if there is one thing that I hate about her, more than any other character on the fucking show, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that quote that I put at the start of the review. She called the match between Sakura and Elena the finest form of entertainment in the whole world. She just shitted on the entire world of professional wrestling this that one sentence. I know that it shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be taken seriously but fuck it: Fuck off Mariko! You wish you had as much depth as your cleavage does! Fuck you and this show, bitch!\n\nEarlier on I talked about how shit the animation was whilst explain the \u00e2\u0080\u009cplot\u00e2\u0080\u009d (and I use that term lightly here) of this shit show. But it needs to be said again: THIS SHOW LOOKS LIKE SHIT! The art style is generic as all hell, with nearly every character having a similar design and no cup size below C (if we exclude the high school girl, no cup size below D). This show also has only two proper locations; the gym and the wrestling ring. This show is so devoid of artistic freedom that even at 12 episodes I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m surprised at how long it went for. Character movement is just garbage, and when they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t showing proper movement, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re showing close-ups, screen shots, and reused footage, and it is painful to watch. The fan-service. Is fucking painful. To everyone who likes shows like this because of the ecchi elements in place, if you removed the close-ups of female anatomy from this show it would be very bland. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what this show was, even with the fan-service, because it fails at using ecchi well at all. In fact, with the kind of shots that were used repeatedly within the show, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more disturbing than erotic at all. Seeing Sakura\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vagina whilst during a submission for the umptieth time is not only tiring, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just sad. \n\nIf there was anything that I would say was positive from this show, it would have to be the opening and ending themes. Not the overall OP and ED; those shit videos were piss breaks. But the themes on their own fits with the idol part of the show, and were at least decent to listen to. I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say that I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t skip them every time, but they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t further hinder the show. Overall the soundtrack was a dud, with no song standing out except for one that sounded like a rip-off of the battle theme from the original Pokemon games. In my opinion, no song meshed well with any of the scenes in the show. Voice-acting wise, well what can I say? Half the time the characters were just moaning and screaming; it was just annoying. I guess I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say the voice of Sakura did the best, since she screamed more than anyone else, but then again I screamed just as much from just watching this piece of trash anime.\n\nThis show is literally one of the worst anime that I have ever layed my eyes on. It tries to make professional wrestling look like a noble and rigorous sport, whilst cutting to a muff shot every 10 seconds. It puts pandering shit fests like Queen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Blade and Sekirei to shame. The makers of this disturbing fan-service filled and generic as fuck \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou-can-do-it\u00e2\u0080\u009d crapfest should have changed the name from Wanna Be the Strongest in the World, to Wanna Be the Worst in the World, because this show is deserving of a title like that. The entire existence of the show was an elaborate scheme made to animate bouncing boobies and bulging coochies whilst under the extremely thinly-veiled disguise of telling a story, and an awful one at that. The plot was pure garbage. Calling the cast of this show characters would be giving them too much credit. This is a failure in every possible sense of the word. If you want a proper sports drama, check out something like Hajime no Ippo. If you want proper use of ecchi in a story, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend Prison School. If you just want to see scantily-clad animated women play with each other, even Keijo and some hentai shows would be better than this pile of garbage."}, {"id": 3301, "score": 31, "body": "\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you create a web of lies, you'll inevitably trap yourself and become everyone's meal instead\u00e2\u0080\u009d- someone, somewhere, sometime\n\nPrincess Principal is an unorthodox title to be sure. Steampunk, non-linear storytelling, and rule of cool. Sounds like it should've been a winner, but it was a case doomed to fail as soon as it set out, exposing itself rather quickly as a fraud and a disaster. It's stupid, it's uncool, and most of all, it's insulting. It tried desperately to confuse you and come off as smart and then it tries to patronize you. \n\nPrincess Principal is the condescending and obnoxious dreck from the same team that gave us one of last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most crushing disappointments, Izetta the Last Witch. As blasphemous as this sounds, that show was still better than this one in every single way. Keep in mind, Izetta was sort of a train wreck and plenty were hurt by its unkept promises despite the setting and premise. However, it's like this show decided to do it one worse yet still be seen as better. Let the truth be heard, let this series be exposed for its lies, and let it be cannibalized and demonized for ruining my hopes and dreams of having a better Izetta, just like with Youjo Senki only half a year prior! Let me, the man it deceived the cruelest, have my vengeance, for the lies end here!\n\nCase ST 2\n\nWhen a narrative starts out on such an awful foot as to have narrator exposition of the past as the opening scene and then have a bunch of asspull revelations and stupid moments (few of which ever come to make sense later), then your narrative needs to do a lot to make a recovery. It never does. In fact, those asspull revelations are occasionally present, like the ballerina revelation in episode 1. It tries to play itself as smart by creating information (that it claims that we missed) out of thin air; that obviously not smart. It does this a few times and it's annoying every time. The technology doesn't make any sense either and is poorly explained. Apparently, there is this C-ball that the main character has and at one point they try to steal the prototype that was just finished, except they already have the original so that officially makes no sense. Lastly, the factions are insanely difficult to keep up with thanks to how the executed their non-linear storytelling, and we don't even k is which side between the commonwealth and the royals is the east or west side.\n\nAs stated earlier, this show treats you like an idiot. The asspull revelations that never add up aren't the only example of this. Hell, they're not even the most egregious. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more egregious is the fact that this show constantly beats you over the head. Every single episode, the show constantly drives home the fact that spies lie and that they're not good people, as well as that everyone always lies. More than 5% of the total dialogue is centered around these three things. The dialogue is so condescending and terrible overall, and with all this thrown in the pot, it's just an especially big insult to the audience's intelligence. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you know that spies are liars?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gee, I sure did, hell, so did everyone watching. You don't have to remind us constantly. Anywhere between 3 and 25 times an episode, especially in the early episodes. Not everyone knows when they're being mocked or patronized but when you realize that it's happening to you, it's aggravating, so a show shouldn't ever do that to the viewer, who is maybe trying to use this as an escape from reality. Instead, Princess Principal, how about you instead focus on telling a coherent story and SHUT THE FUCK U-\n\nLying is bad\n\nThat being said, there are times where you can see a glimmer of hope in the narrative. As predictable as episode 6 is, the finale and tragic irony of the song to the situation at hand is brilliant, almost reminiscent of some of the other works this writer has worked on, specifically the final scene of the 23rd episode of Code Geass, a personal favorite. This series, especially in the second half, starts actually trying to elicit emotion, but it's not always effective at it. Sure there are good moments like episode 7 which was the only really solid episode of the show barring some of 6, but then we get episode 8 which while that did provide context to some scenes from earlier, it actually reveals another problem and missed opportunity in episode 2, one of the worst of the series; this isn't even speaking of the embarrassingly bad and mind-numbingly stereotypical episode 9 which feels like it would normally be a sappy kids show episode that also patronizes the audience. In a way, it's almost trying to be the reverse Izetta where instead of starting off decently and turning to complete shit later on, it starts off horrendously and gets better later, except it stumbles as that hallways through the second half anyway and ends up back where it started. Too little too late comes to mind. Besides, the finale is a sequel bait disaster anyway and anytime the show takes a step forward, it takes a stab back as well.\n\nCase C 2\n\nWith the exception of Ange and Charlotte, none of the characters have any semblance of chemistry. Hell, none of the are memorable. Their personalities are beyond basic and not-fleshed out or progressed at all. There is no one worth giving a damn about, for they are so lifeless and static. If this show I supposed to be a rule of cool series, why does only one character try for this angle (the girl with the tits), and why isn't it one of the more prominent characters? They're so plain and tired, and one of them, names Beatrice, starts out especially bad and hypocritical. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the typical \u00e2\u0080\u009cprincess loli bodyguard\u00e2\u0080\u009d trope except more annoying, and then she becomes a mod benign version of this exact same trope with little to no progression. Hell, all of these people are little more than tropes! The two \u00e2\u0080\u009cbest\u00e2\u0080\u009d characters are Ange and Dorothy. Dorothy because she tries at rule of cool and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hot (and she actually has an explored past), and Ange because she has this weird thing about the Black Lizard Planet she keeps lying about nonchalantly. Oh, and she and this princess kinda sorta love each other...I suppose. Reasonings loosely related to it are dumb though. Regardless, the idea that such straws need to be grasped just to say something interesting about these characters is proof of their failure as a cast. This isn't even speaking of the other characters that come later since they're not worth mentioning and they exacerbate this issue.\n\nCase A 4\n\nThe show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visuals do not fare much better. Studios Actas and 3Hz did a joint effort for this project, and if nothing else, they were consistent...ly bad. The Light Novel default art style aggravates and does not look appealing in the slightest, and the designs range from mediocre to abysmal, with the worst being Chise\u00e2\u0080\u0099s design. The rest of the art looks decent and occasionally pretty detailed, like with the C-ball, and that's the only praise I'll give the visuals. The animation is ok at best, though the fights are pretty badly choreographed. The CGI ranges from mediocre (for the cars) to abysmal (for the people) and there is even a moment with a CGI room for the foreground and background and it causes a long 7 seconds of bad slowdown (what is it with anime that have CGI and slowdown and why are all of them always shitty anime?). When we see these backgrounds in situations of motion, or any time for that matter, they look terrible, and so does the photorealistic backgrounds of the school garden, which you will see from time to time. Shame since the steampunk-esque setting is an interesting one in terms of potential visuals yet these don't warrant much merit.\n\nCase SO 6\n\nOne of the most renowned composers in the industry, Yuki Kajiura did the music for this anime. This is honestly one of the weaker OSTs I've heard from her to date. The songs are mostly pretty reserved and thus aren't very memorable, and the few that are more blaring and interesting aren't nearly of the same quality of some of the best tracks of her other works, like the SAO and Fate/Zero OSTs. The tracks are repeated quite often too to make matters worse. The OP, \"The Other Side of the Wall\" by Void_Chords feat.MARU, is easily one of the best of the season. It emphasizes rule of cool and is filled with the frantic energy that makes you pumped to watch each episode of the show, as awful as this show is; it is the only real good thing I could find in this show, which is unfortunate. The ED, \"A Page of My Story\" by Ange (Ayaka Imamura), Princess (Akira Sekine), Dorothy (You Taichi), Beatrice (Akari Kageyama), Chise (Nozomi Furuki), fares nowhere near as well, as contrarian as this apparently sounds. It is an ok enough track on its own but intro in particular gives me major mood whiplash every time I finish an episode. Overall, it was a decent enough repertoire of music but little was special and it was honestly underwhelming on the whole.\n\nCase E 3\n\nThis show was very difficult to enjoy. The action wasn't even that competent, the characters were unbelievably dull and bad, the plot was wrecked beyond belief, and the show treats the audience like a dunce. The most enjoyment I got out of it was listening to the OP theme by you can do that as well as engage in the full version without having to see the show anyway. Not to say that the experience was heinous but it was continually frustrating and I am left bitter for it.\n\nCase O 3\n\nWith that, the case is closed. Princess Principal is hereby found guilty of lying about being a good show, treating its audience like an imbecile, being caught so far up a web of lies and lack of proper establishing that everything is convoluted, and all around being a massive disappointment. For a rule of cool show, this didn't even try that hard in any aspect, even visually or musically, and for a show of emotion, it shot itself in the foot almost every time it tried. It's off to the cellar, Princess Principal; good riddance."}, {"id": 3302, "score": 40, "body": "It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a tale as old as time, and yet it still takes place in the distant future\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 After space on Earth started to become scarce, the human race expanded to the stars, developing the technology to terraform planets and claiming them for the sake of creating brand new civilizations.

I mean, I wrote up a Gantz review several years ago, but that was LONG before I actually learned how to write reviews. Well, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never seeing the light of day, so I guess my intro to all things Gonzo will take the form of the apparently immortal 2002 classic sci-fi series Kiddy Grade. Now, with your typical Studio Gonzo production, you can expect it to fall on one of two sides of the scale\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll either have gorgeous high-budget animation, or dirt-cheap animation that does it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s damnedest to appear as visually pleasing as possible. Kiddy Grade falls very securely on the low side of the scale, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made a LOT worse looking shows than this.\n\nYes, I should get this out of the way right now\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The fact that it had a low budget couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be more obvious if it was on the street pan-handling. Key frames\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 AKA, moments when there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no action on screen other than mouth flaps, brief bursts of movement and embarrassing motion loops\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Are everywhere. Even at their scarcest, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in every other scene at least. Thankfully, these issues never pop up during the action scenes, so while it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a good look per se, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s somewhat excusable considering how cleverly Gonzo was able to portray the femme fatales kicking villainous ass without having to sacrifice frame rates to compensate it. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of CG used for the characters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 space ships and guardian mech robots, and while it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really mesh with the 2D animation style of the rest of the series, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not too bad on it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own merits.\n\nWhile the animation is relatively good, at least compared to other Gonzo shows of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time, the artwork is a lot stronger. The color palette is bright and diverse, standing out beautifully against the backgrounds, most of which are monotonous and gritty with realistic wear. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say the backgrounds are never impressive, as there are some very appealing outdoor scenes, but the dullness of spaceship interiors and even space itself complements the characters nicely. The character designs are diverse almost to a fault, as each pair of ES members looks increasingly unique to the point that I could imagine them being pulled out of the sketchbook of a caffeine addict on a 5 Hour Energy binge. Simply put, with it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s highly distinctive art style, there are no other characters that look like Kiddy Grade characters.\n\nThe music is made up mostly of electronic tunes, meant to convey the spacey, futuristic feel of the show, and does so in an ambitious fashion. The soundtrack was fairly new for it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time, but looking back at it fourteen years later, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been done a lot better since then, causing what was once a unique sound to feel kind of generic to our spoiled ears. The opening, on the other hand is a lot more standard, and was probably considered generic even back in 2002. Setting aside the video for a moment, you have two options with this opening\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 A dubbed version and a subbed version. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard countless people recommend the sub, but is it that much better? The singing is definitely louder and more confidant, but it opens on a pair of cringe-worthy Engrish lines that sound awkward in both pronunciation and wording. The dubbed version fixes this problem, which earns it some points, but it also features a far duller-sounding singer, and the lyrics\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Like most anime theme lyrics\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Do not translate well to English. I want to recommend the subbed version really badly, but those damn opening lines, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6The Ending theme, in both languages, is a much more pleasant listen.\n\nThe English dub is from the very early stages of Funimation, and as such it shows a lot of quirks from that period of Funi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existence. There are plenty of names in it that you really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see as much anymore, such as Dameon Clarke, Scarlett McAllister, Gwendoline Lau, Rebecca Paige, John Myron, Antimere Robinson\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Just a ton of names that either haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worked in years or only had a brief stint in anime, and for the most part, none of them are really that impressive here. The exception of course is Demeon Clarke as the shady auditor Armblast, but even this role is a far cry from the acting chops he showed as the original Scar in FMA. There are a few modern names sprinkled throughout, such as Eric Vale, Vic Mignona, Alison Victorin in her debut role, Chris Sabat doing a pretty sweet European accent, and Clarine Harp doing something other than DVD design, and yeah, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all really good\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But none of them can touch Colleen Clinkenbeard and Monica Rial in the lead roles.\n\nMonica Rial is probably one of the most well known voice actors in the business. Her name is almost guaranteed to be on any anime fan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favorite actor list, and for good reason. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a consistently good performer, and has been ever since her first day on the job. In contrast, a name I see disturbingly little of on those lists is Colleen Clinkenbeard, who may actually be the most under-rated and taken-for-granted performer in the industry. Kiddy Grade was her debut not only as an actor, but as an ADR director, and while I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m disappointed to say both jobs amounted to some rough results in the beginning of the show\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The acting was somewhat underwhelming, voices weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always matching the lip flaps\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It improved rapidly on both counts towards the middle, showing off a lot of the latent talent that she had both in and out of the booth.\n\nYes, the dub takes a while to get off of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mainly due to the growing pains of a duel first timer. Colleen has proven herself since then to be a highly respectful director and writer who can easily navigate the minefield of localizing a dub without bastardizing it, and has shown in several instances that she can hit all the slanginess of a Jamie Marchi dub without suffering from any of the tasteless Jamie Marchi excess. As an actor, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shown a surprising consistency across a wide range of voices, giving her a chameleon quality that can make her very difficult to pick out, even when she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s playing a bubbly and upbeat character like Eclair. Pair her with fellow veterans Monica Rial and Laura Bailey, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a dub that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty damn good at it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best moments. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not necessarily better than the sub, but if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for a time capsule of early-2000\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Funimation, I highly recommend it.\n\nOkay, so, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s set aside my earlier plot synopsis for a second and go over what this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really about. Kiddy Grade is the story of two femme fatale law enforcers with charisma and power to spare. One is a hacker that can manipulate and even astral-project herself into any kind of computer system or machine, and the other has super-speed, super strength, and a tube of lipstick that can turn into a razor-sharp whip. They work for a supposedly benevolent organization, but corruption in the upper ranks forces them into political conflicts where they eventually have to engage in space battles and mecha fights against their peers and coworkers.while gradually revealing their own troubled past.\n\nWhy am I bringing this up? Because Kiddy Grade has one of the most awesome sounding premises I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever heard. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know a single person who could hear it and not immediately put it on their \u00e2\u0080\u009cto-watch\u00e2\u0080\u009d list. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a title that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s endured in the popular conscience for 14 years without fading into obscurity, so one would naturally assume it to be of some quality, or at least a sizeable fanbase willing to overlook any problems it might have. And yet, when I go on Facebook to say it hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t aged well, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m met not with anger, but likes. When I complain about some details that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fit right in retrospect, I get responses pointing out MORE inconsistencies related to the plot over-all before anybody comes in to defend it. Keep in mind, this is happening in very similar fan groups to the two that I got booted out of for talking shit about Guilty Crown, so where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the flame war over this? And while we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on the subject, why can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I watch more than a few episodes at a time without pausing to do chores?\n\nTo answer this question, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to be dissecting three specific episodes of the show. Depending on how high their respective ep. numbers are, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be using different amount of detail and spoilers for each one. First up, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take a look at episode five, Day/Off. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to be running down the entire episode in detail, but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Cowboy Bebop, here. Important spoilers don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen until much later.\n\nTo start, Eclaire and Lumiere have the day off from work, so they each decide to spend it differently. Eclair goes out drinking with a friend, and Lumiere goes to the opera. Sounds like a great set-up for some one-on-one character development, right? Well, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s see what happens. An employee at the club approaches Eclaire, commenting that she looks too young to be in there. His manager comes along and says that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new, and not to bother the lady\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Not because she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an ES member, mind you, but just because \u00e2\u0080\u009ckicking people out makes us look bad.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Which makes no sense, because serving alcohol to minors definitely looks worse. She dances with a guy, and when he tries to kiss her, she shoves him through the air and into the table where two criminal organizations are making a deal. They both assume the attack was orchestrated by the other side, which doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make sense, because who plans to have a human being thrown at their table? Even Monty Python wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come up with a strategy that absurd.\n\nOn her way to the opera, Lumiere hears a lonely little girl crying behind some bushes. The little girl kisses her and puts her into a trance so some big men can abduct her. Which makes no sense, because didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we just see Eclaire successfully fend off a kiss from a much larger man? Why would her partner just stand there and let it happen? Lumiere wakes up in a storage room with a bunch of other kids who were abducted as well. Which makes no sense because are there really that many kids walking to the opera alone that she just happened to be one of them? Seeing how quickly she escapes her bindings, its fairly obvious they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know about her power, so it would have to be random, right? And how was the trap girl immune to her own lipstick?\n\nThe crime organization recruits Eclaire to work on a mission to pay off her debt to them\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Which makes no sense, because not only should she have bolted during the confusion, but they were the ones who misconstrued a clutzy coincidence\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And she winds up face to face with the ship that her partner has just killed the pilots and taken control of, which makes no sense because not only is she supposed to be elegant, or because an agent who needs permission to make arrests shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to kill so easily, but because coincidence is the tool of lazy writers. Anyway, this leaves a lot of unconscious kids to be returned home, but as it turns out, Lumiere has found an on-board computer with a database of the names of all the abducted kids, past and present. This makes no sense because A: Why would they keep a record of kids they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have anymore? B: Why would they need a record of ANY of their names? C: If they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using it for ransom purposes, they must know names of the kids before trapping them, so why go after Lumiere, who doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come from a rich family? D: What about the honeypot kid? Is she a robot? Was she brainwashed? Did they rescue her as well, or was her part in the story done once the audience got their yuri-loli tease?\n\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re having trouble pinning down my first specific complaint, count up the amount of times I said \u00e2\u0080\u009cDidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t/doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make any sense\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the space of one single episode. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t an exception, but the rule. The entire series is like that. Out of almost ninety percent of the things that happen in this series, none of it makes any sense. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s either poorly explained or it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be explained until later. Characters make decisions that are not only stupid, but baffling in terms of the logic they use, forming plans that are either overly-complicated or horribly misguided, or both. The freaking white rabbit is easier to follow than this series is at most points. Even an issue as basic as what the characters are becomes confusing. They are just humans with nanomachines prolonging their lives, right? Well how the hell can their consciousness jump into new bodies? A brain transplant? Are they robots?\n\nFor my second point, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take a somewhat more vague look at episode 14, Steel/Heart. A thing happens in this episode, and while I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go into specifics about who, how or why, two of Eclair and Lumiere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s closest allies are\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Um, I know this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the right word, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll say \u00e2\u0080\u009cBrainwashed\u00e2\u0080\u009d to avoid spoiling too much\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 to kill them. Our heroes fight valiantly, but are unable to save themselves without destroying their friends. Now, this should be an emotional moment, yes? There should be feels here, but alas, there are none to be had. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stress enough how important hope is when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to write a tragedy. In order for a character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death to make an impact on the viewer, there has to be some sort of hope that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll survive, but no, as soon as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbrainwashing\u00e2\u0080\u009d takes place, they might as well have put a big countdown timer on the screen, because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re never given any indication that our heroes can do anything but delay the inevitable.\n\nAnd furthermore, their death doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any feeling of weight to it because despite their constant presence in the story, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re only given one highly forgettable episode to suggest that they even WERE characters to begin with. But then again, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only about half as much time as any other supporting character is given, so why not? There is a huge cast of characters in Kiddy Grade, and while they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re wildly diverse in terms of appearance and powers, they just have jack shit in terms of personality. Oh, they have quirks\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a sibling team where the sister refuses to let her brother call her \u00e2\u0080\u0098sister\u00e2\u0080\u0099 on the clock, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a child/adult team that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always arguing about where to eat, and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Other\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Teams\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about as far as any of them go. All-in-all, the actions of any given team could easily be swapped out with the actions of any other given team.\n\nEven the two main characters fail to leave much of an impression. Lumiere is probably the most interesting character in the cast, as she can at least claim to be elegant and have refined tastes, but she quickly turns that into a gimmick by constantly saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cA lady should be more elegant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the precocious loli, which is more of a trope than a trait. Eclaire is of course the main character, so by the tradition of lazy writing, she has to be the perfectly righteous and idealistic hero. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a martyr waiting to happen, and it gets annoying really fast. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at least one villain who shows promise, but her motives seem confused between altruism and misanthropy. The Noblesse, who are supposed to be the true villains of the show, are native-born Earthlings, and they are nothing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I repeat, nothing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But upper-crust snobs with sticks up their asses and a contempt for all people lower than them.\n\nSpeaking of the noblesse, my final example isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so much an episode as a plot twist that happens towards the end of the series. I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spoil it, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the first step in what might be a huge downfall for the Noblesse, and it has a lot in common with April O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Neal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expanded connection to the Ninja Turtles that was revealed in the latest TMNT movie. Only in this case, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like the turtles were absent and just barely eluded to for four-fifths of the story before coming in like an exposition wrecking ball to tie everything together. Oh, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also have to imagine that April\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been firmly established to have a lot more important things to do than play nanny through the formative years of a bunch of freaking turtles. Seriously, these are supposed to be warriors with respectable authority, why the hell was one of them on nurse-maid duty? And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this final little twist\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 One that even Shyamalan would have sent back to the drawing board\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 That proves just how terribly, terribly written this anime is.\n\nThe series attempts, at about the halfway point, to explain how all of the events that happened up until that point were part of one interconnected plot, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s delivered through status reports to the chief of the GOTT. There are two problems with this, the first of which being that the explanation grinds the pace to a complete halt, and rather than sounding like a canon summary of events, it sounds more like an imaginative fanboy on Reddit tying to connect all the Pixar movies together. The stretching is that bad. Second of all, when you really look at it, this one episode gives away the one thing the creators of Kiddy Grade had been going through all of this BS to try to accomplish.\n\nYes, there was a legitimate goal in mind, here. These writers had an agenda, and once you start making the comparisons, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of embarrassing what they were trying to do; They were trying really hard to make Kiddy Grade the Evangelion of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s genre. That entire sequence was a callback to an episode of Evangelion where the Angels that had been defeated thus far were listed off in a similar report. The narrative is constantly pushing meaningless religious symbolism, like the concept of sacrifice and rebirth, crucifixes, and hell, the organization our cast works for is called Gott, the German word for God. An entire episode is spent on Eclair trying to pull herself together psychologically after a random flashback brought out some erased memories, and the episode is a laughable attempt to copy the mental depth of a show that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t all that deep in the first place.\n\nSo after all that, why is this show so well remembered? Why has it thrived for so long in the public consciousness, when all of the best things it has to offer are now dated? How does a combination of pathos, faux complexity and poorly directed fanservice demand so much name recognition in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market? Well, it all comes down to Kiddy Grade\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sense of style. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think of any anime before or after this one that had the same kind of aesthetic to it, giving it a weird sort of iconic feel.\n\nPeople like things that are unique, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one word I can definitely apply to Kiddy Grade. It fails to tell a good story, it fails to build good characters, and in the end, all it really has to offer is spectacle of two good looking girls kicking ass, like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the pretentious version of Dirty Pair\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Which is all some people want, I guess. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any good ideas\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 On the contrary, I think it had a ton of good ideas, but what it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have was a good enough writer to make them work\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And sadly, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty damn important.\n\nKiddy Grade is available from Funimation. It was originally released stateside in an 8-disk box set that, despite the hefty price even then, came with a pretty attractive set of trading cards based around the eye-catch artwork of the episodes. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for something cheaper, they did recently release the series in Anime classic thinpack form for a much more reasonable price. There have been three movies that were meant to retell the story of the series, but they haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been released stateside\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 After nine years and counting, I think you can give up waiting any day now. There have also been a handful of light novels and manga serials, but these have also sadly not seen the light of day on our side of the ocean.\n\nWhile Kiddy Grade is a clusterfuck of failed story-telling, with a title that more than describes the level of maturity that went into it, I honestly can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say I hated it. It didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make me feel angry or insulted, nor did it ever make me feel bored. Than again, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to attribute those points to the fact that it just didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make me feel anything, positive or negative. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that bad a show to watch if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind having your brain turned blissfuilly off the whole time, but as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said many times before, I refuse to do that. Then again, with or without my approval, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an anime that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s survived for almost a decade and a half, and through whatever black magic it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strange title has been casting, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pretty sure it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s here to stay. I give Kiddy Grade a 4/10.  "}, {"id": 3303, "score": 40, "body": "Becoming a magical girl isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always easy. Not only is it a challenge, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a competition, and you have to win that competition before you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re even allowed to travel to Earth to take up the position. Yes, that means all Magical Girls are aliens, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go ahead and gloss over that fact. Padudu, an innocent, kind-hearted preteen girl from Sea Heaven, has just moved to the world of Sweetland to face these challenges, so that she can live out her dream of going to Earth and spreading happiness wherever she goes! Alongside her in this quest is her loyal familiar Oukochi, a giant hollow fish that she wears as a coat and occasionally feeds on. She also winds up traveling with Pipin, a girl with a bunny as her familiar/backpack, and MyuMyu, and older girl who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s familiar is a pair of cats that she wears as a bikini. Did you bring the drugs? Cool.\n\nAlong their quest as both friends and rivals, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to compete in bizarre challenges where they protect small areas of territory from sumo-driven catastrophes, eat the most food, grant the most wishes, survive as flat minorities in a 3D CG world, make the most money and more as they fend off attacks from the underhanded Queen Pirilun and her useless minion Zucchini, a twelve year old boy with a sunflower around his neck and a fetish for physical pain. Also pursuing them are two police officers, a veteran named Ketchup and her rookie partner named Mustard, but fear not, for the silent wanderer Nonononn is on their side to protect them\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Whenever she happens to be around. At the forefront of their path to destiny lies a battle for dominance in a Wonderland so bug-nuts that even Alice would give up and go fetal.\n\nMagical Play was produced by Anime International Company, otherwise known as Studio AIC. This might sound a little polarizing to those of you familiar with them, because AIC is somewhat of an unpredictable producer. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve put out several great looking anime before, such as Now and Then Here and There, Bamboo blade, Kotoura-san\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Shows that look simple at first glance, but had generous budgets poured into them. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also been known to take on really artistic projects, like Humanity Has Declined, where the focus is more on eye-catching visuals and ambiance than expensive movement. Then the majority of the work, particularly the ton of ecchi titles they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve put out, were made as cheaply as hell, and have no problem showing it.\n\nMagical Play was originally released on the internet as a series of twenty-four short-length episodes that were pretty much designed to fall into obscurity. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t imagine AIC intended to impress anybody with it, which is why I expected it to fall into the third of those categories\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Oddly enough, it seems to have fallen equally into all three. The animation has a very cheap aesthetic, and it can look really awkward in the beginning, but the budget management does seem to get better through the course of the series. It starts out with a lot of frozen talking heads and static backgrounds, but before long the motion has improved to the point that they were able to use full-blown walk cycles and everything. It looks as decent as it needs to, never really going out of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way to impress anybody\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Except for the CG scenes.\n\nYes, every so often, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 3D animation in this show. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sparse for the first few episodes, and is removed enough from the real story to not be too distracting\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But in the beginning of episode four, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an entire mini episode where Padudu and MyuMyu have mysteriously walked into a 3D land, despite the two of them being two dimensional. I guess I should say right now that this is early 2000s Japanese 3D animation, so it looks a lot like RWBY but with better looking hair and quality control. The juxtaposition of two flat-as-paper characters walking around a 3D rendered world is a surreal image that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen very often, outside of one episode of Gravity Falls, and while I would complain about how awful the 3D animation actually is, the episode itself already makes ruthless fun of itself, complete with animation glitches and a scene where somebody literally crashes reality.\n\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a common misconception\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, common among the people who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve actually heard of this show\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 That it shares a creator with Azumanga Daioh. While it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true that Kiyohiko Azuma did work on this, he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really do all that much\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 He was the character designer, and nothing more. The humor and animation are obviously not his style, but the rounded facial structures and familiar hairstyles are so similar to his iconic work that once you notice it, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never not be able to. And honestly, the character designs are one of the best things about this series, so kudos to him, he clearly put a lot of imagination into what the outfits of a bunny, cat, and fish-based trio of magical girls would look like, and Nonononn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shark design is absolutely stunning. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even mentioned in the commentary that the heads of MyuMyu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cat bra look very similar to the mysterious dream character Chiyo-daddy.\n\nThe music is fairly standard and forgettable, made up of a lot of plinky, upbeat slice of life music with that all too common hint of whimsy thrown in for good measure. The opening is your typical bouncy children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tune with a video full of easy-going visuals, the characters moving across the screen and smiling\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And some near nudity followed by a nose-blood-splurt with the power of a rocket. The opening, in other words, is a perfect representation of the show, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to that later. The English dub is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 well\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s awful from just about every angle. None of the actors seem to have been blessed with any talent, and about three quarters of them perform their roles like the director was sitting right outside the booth with a gun saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cLOUDER! MORE SCREECHY! EITHER THE GLASS BREAKS, OR YOU DO!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMost of the so-called actors in this thing are unknown names, with the one exception being Larissa Wolcott, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only really known by ADV snobs. You may remember her as the actor that took on the role Excel Saga\u00e2\u0080\u0099s title character, who was only able to match her predecessor in terms of pace, and was otherwise a dreadful replacement for a renowned power actor. Aside from her, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s somebody who played a minor character in Fairy Tail, a bunch of people who only did enough anime voice roles to be counted on one hand, and the girl playing Pipin, who sounds voice-wise like Hillary Haag, but is such a bad actor that comparing any further than there would be borderline sacrilegious. I would say the only saving grace with any of these performances is that they do sound accurate to the Japanese performances.\n\nThe writing in the dub, on the other hand, is anything but accurate, as entire exchanges are rewritten to the point of abandoning the intent behind them entirely. For an early example, Padudu encounters Pipin in the desert, and the hyper bunny girl says \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re lucky I allowed you to rescue me\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do one favor for you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d When in the dub, she says \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow dare you show your face to me! Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fight!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Or something along those lines. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bizarre, because at no point in the series can I decipher the reason that any of the dialogue was changed as drastically as it was. I mean, I guess some of it was removed because Japanese folklore would be inaccessible to American audiences, but the stuff they replaced it with is rarely any better. Whether you watch this show in Japanese or English, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s equally as baffling, so just pick whichever one sounds better to you.\n\nOff the top of your head, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to hear what you think the most random anime of all time would be. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be forgiven for picking FLCL, as it switches styles on a dime, features a borderline incomprehensible story. You might have picked the Revolutionary Girl Utena movie, or perhaps Excel Saga and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spin-off Puni Puni Poemy. Sorry, guys, but Magical Play beats them out. FLCL may be insane, but it has a primary setting and a sense of continuity, with interwoven themes between the episodes. It has a beginning and an end, which Magical Play doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Utena\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movie held several deep themes and is loaded with symbolism, which Magical Play isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Excel Saga may have attributed each episode to a different genre, but there was structure there. Puni Puni Poemy, as well, had a sense of direction and focus.\n\nThe anime that comes closest to Magical Play\u00e2\u0080\u0099s level of insanity is Humanity Had Declined, which is a non-linear story revolving around the human and elf(?) races, between whom no bizarre stunt is too crazy to work as an episode, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a sense of development as we learn more about our heroine and her little friends. Magical Play doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even do that. It takes anything the viewer may have learned about story-telling, throws it out, and tries instead to emulate the Oscar winning short Rejected. Okay, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not AS random as Rejected was, but there was no moment in this show where a swarm of ticks bursting out of somebody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nipples would have felt out of place.\n\nThe plot of the series is thus; In order to become a magical girl, you have to win fight, complete tasks and succeed in competitions, through all of which you win Flower Marks, little stickers that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be calling Star Chips, because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basically what they are. Padudu falls from the sky and lands on Pipin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head, taking her out right after she won a fight, thus stealing her victory. She wins Pipin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s star chip, earning herself a lifelong rival. She then meets MyuMyu, who decides to use Padudu as a patsy and human shield. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where any semblance of a plot ends, and from then on out, the whole Star Chip thing just serves as a backdrop for everything our three main characters do to fill out air time. That end of the plot, by the way, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even halfway through episode 1.\n\nFrom then on, the series is essentially a collection of sub-plots and running gags intermingled with each other. Padudu is always eating meat from her fish-coat, Pipin is always complaining about her lost Star Chip, MyuMyu cheats and manipulates them, MyuMyu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bikini cats wander away to embarrass her with out-of-frame nudity, the Dandelion boy atempts to attack her and Nonononn but is always foiled by either his ACME equipment malfunctioning or MyuMyu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boobs giving him a nosebleed, the cops suck at being cops, and the three main girls do random stuff that is at best half-assedly connected to a message. As far as pay-offs go, nobody ever wins another Star Chip, Pirilun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beef with Nonononn is never resolved, and the hapless cops never catch a break. The only resolution we ever reach is with Oukichi, who is sacrificed for a massive feast just so the sadistic Padudu can find out what\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll happen when his meat gets depleted.\n\nWe get two backstory episodes, which is the only real derivation from the running gags and sub-plots, but neither of them are particularly important. The first one deals with Padudu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life in Sea Heaven, how she met Oukichi, and how she first started to eat his insides. The other one goes into the childhood friendship of Nonononn and Pirilun, and while I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll admit that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a surprisingly somber tale without much laughs, it ends up meaning jack shit in the long run, as it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t connect to anything that happens afterward or before. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give the show some serious credit for only being four episodes long, because otherwise it might have lost it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shock value and become dull like Hare + Guu did, but still, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to come away from it feeling anything other than empty. It has it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moments, of course, and I particularly loved the segment where an attempt to grant wishes went overboard and caused Armageddon. But overall, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too few laughs to be a comedy, and no real depth to justify it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slow, casual insanity. At least it made for a good AMV Hell 3 clip.\n\nMagical Play is available from ADV Films, now known as Sentai Filmworks. There are two different DVD collections available, one that was released in 2004, and a more recent one from 2013, and while I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know quite what the difference is, the 2004 one can be found ridiculously cheap online. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fifth episode that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fit into the canon of the first four, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an all CG tale where Padudu teams up with Nonononn to fight a fat, dancing Jamaican woman, and if that sounds appealing to you, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s available on both releases. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also available, like the main show, to be viewed for free on Crunchyroll. In addition, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apparently two manga adaptations, but I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find information on either one.\n\nFrom what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said thus far, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve probably guessed that I have a negative opinion of this show. In a way, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re right. There aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a whole lot of positive things I can say about it, apart from it having decent looking characters and some funny moments. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a good show, but I just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help recommending it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so bizarre and bat-shit crazy that, if nothing else, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth watching for the experience alone. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not gonna lie, the second I saw on the DVD cover that the main character wore a sentient fish coat that she ate pieces of meat from, it was as good as purchased. There is no better anime to showcase just how weird and random the medium can be, so I feel like watching it at least once is something every anime fan should do, like School Days and Garzey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Wing. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bad show, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just the right kind of bad to be ironically important. I give Magical Play a 4/10. "}, {"id": 3304, "score": 20, "body": "Ryoko Okami is a sixteen year old student, who goes to the very prestigious Otogi High School. She has a strong sense of justice, and is always ready and willing to throw her all into a fight in order to protect herself and others. This admirable toughness, along with her generosity and benevolence towards those weaker than her, serve her very well in the Otogi Bank, a school club that does favors for people in exchange for returned favors down the road.  She often works with her best friend and room mate, Akai Ringo, a girl who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sweet and charming on the outside but cunning and manipulative on the inside. Together, this team of Wolf and Red strike terror into the hearts of the wicked\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 All of whom look like stereotypical anime punks.\n\nOne day, as they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re walking home from a mission, a mysterious boy from their class follows them, and proclaims his love for Ryoko! His name is Morino Ryoushi, a boy who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bold in tongue but shy at heart, who gets terrified whenever somebody stares at him. But only if they think the word \u00e2\u0080\u0098staaaaaaaare\u00e2\u0080\u0099 while they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing it. With his ability to seemlessly blend into a crowd, he gets recruited into Otogi Bank, and now, the three have to continue working together! Well, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the set-up\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll save the plot for later, because hoo boy.\n\nFor now, Okami-san was produced by JC Staff, the people who produced Index and Toradora, and to say that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a step down would be putting it nicely. For those who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember it, the animation in Toradora could occasionally look cheap and clunky, like a sketchy pen-and-ink design that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite finished. In order to make the movement of thew characters appear fluid, they skimp on the artwork, making for a really weird looking result if you go to slow-mo. There are quite a few shows that default to this style once or twice in order to stretch their budgets, like Samurai Seven and Welcome to the NHK. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ugly, but taken in small doses, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the worst thing in the world.\n\nWell, Okami-san is presented entirely in this style, from beginning to end, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incredibly difficult to get used to. The backgrounds and landscapes are amazing, but in regards to the characters\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like K-ON, but a few drafts shy of the final draft. Yeah, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what I was smoking when I said the animation was top notch, because this is some of the cheapest, ugliest animation that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen. Most of the time, when the characters are talking, their appearance onscreen will consist of a tiny burst of movement followed by several seconds of still frame. The characters are designed to be proportionally normal and slightly angular, and yet theiir faces are completely moefied, making for character designs that honestly give me a headache to look at. To make matters worse, there are more frozen backgrounds here than in March of the Penguins, as characters who aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t speaking just stand there, still as statues, errily refusing to even blink.\n\nThe dub isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t terrible, but we are unfortunately dealing with a Jamie Marchi script, and like usual, I can tell it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s her within the first half of episode one. Have you ever had a weird aunt who tries to look cool by saying all the hip slangy stuff that she thinks your generation will be able to relate to, even though she just comes off as ironically charming at best? That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Jamie Marchi. Thankfully, she shares duties with Chuck Huber, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not as bad as it could have been.\n\nJoel McDonald plays Ryoushi as earnestly as possible, doing a great job in making him likeable. Monica Rial seems to have a great understanding of her character, as she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s able to play every shade of her personality believably. Oddly enough, the one who falls flat is Brina Palencia, who would normally be one of my favorites. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to chalk this up to bad casting, because she never really seems to own this particular character, and you can tell Marchi didn't give her the best dialogue.\n\nThe most depressing part of the dub is Luci Christian, whom I have come to consider the queen of voice acting. Whom I would sell a kidney to meet in person. She plays the part of the narrator, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job extends far past the intros and outros that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d expect her to voice. No, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s present through the entire show, talking our ear off the whole time. She dumps exposition on us, makes rude comments about the characters and their bodies, she drowns out the dialogue, and basically struggles to find some sort of a point for her own existence. Luci tries to make this character interesting, but even with her behind the wheel, I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t heard narration this pointless, cruel and infuriating since Pitch Perfect.\n\nSo, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to go into the plot earlier, and for my reason? Well, the plot of this show is an extensive point of discussion all it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own. This is the basic plot, in a nutshell\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Ryoko is only pretending to be strong, but she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually scared and girly on the inside, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ryoushi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job to warm her icy heart and turn her back to her normal girly self, so that he can be strong for her instead.\n\nThe term \u00e2\u0080\u0098sexist\u00e2\u0080\u0099 gets thrown around a lot, but when the plot of an anime boils directly down to \u00e2\u0080\u0098woman not really strong, let man be strong for you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pretty big red flag, particularly when it has to remind you over and over again that the main character isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually strong. Yeah, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry, was she just duking it out in a street fight with several armed older men? Was she just putting on a brave face while a much larger group of them took her down and attempted to violate her? And she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not strong because she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s afraid and only pretending to be strong? Because she likes puppies and girly novels? Do I even have to point out the layers of bullshit at play here?\n\nSorry, but fearless bravery isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t real bravery, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just stupid recklessness. Being scared but doing the right thing anyway is true courage. The Olson Twins\u00e2\u0080\u0099 made for TV Halloween movie taught me that when I was a child, and this show still has a tough time understanding it.\n\nOh wait, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an explanation for it. She pretends to be tough because she got violated by somebody in middle school, but when she tried to report it, nobody believed her, and everybody started to hate her for lying. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a certain nuance to that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scared and distrustful because she was violated and never vindicated for it, but she acts tough because she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want it to happen again. Her best friend wants to set her up with a good man so she can slowly undo the damage that was done to her. Makes sense, right?\n\nWell, ignoring the troubling implications that this idea makes in regards to the creator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opinions towards women, especially in regards to tomboys, I have to ask\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Why am I supposed to want to see this change happen? What do I, as the viewer, get out of it?\n\nOkay, for the sake of comparison, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talk about Batman for a moment. Yes, I know, they have nothing in common\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Ryoko became a kick-ass vigilante because something traumatic happened to her in the past, while Bruce Wayne became a kick-ass vigilante because\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Okay, maybe they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not that different. Well, Batman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s backstory is so well known that every single incarnation of his story has explored it at some point\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Except for Brave and the Bold during daytime hours, because we must censor to protect the children\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and it ties in perfectly with the development that happens down the road.\n\nNow, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not the first person to suggest this, but it would be very healthy for Bruce Wayne to just get over his parents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 death and give up the crime fighting. He could put aside his cape and cowl, and just live life as the wealthy philanthropist playboy he was born to be. find a good woman, start a family, and live the American dream.\n\nSo, if it would be in his best interest, why doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it happen? Because if it did, nobody would care anymore. The fanbase would die off, and the only readers left would be the ones holding onto the hope that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just some sick dream created by The Mad Hatter.\n\nSimilarly, seeing Ryoko giving up on her quest for justice would take away what is, frankly, the only interesting thing about her. Without it, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just another generic Tsundere. And yet, her best friends\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And some viewers as well\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 want to see this development happen. Apparently it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s okay for a grown man in a black suit to dedicate his life to being strong and kicking ass, but a teenaged high school girl? Work through that shit!\n\nAnd here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my biggest problem with this show. Bigger than my problem with the narrator, or with Marchi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s writing. Remember Ryoko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best friend, Ringo? These two didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t meet until a year after Ryoko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assault. The person Ringo met is, through and through, the very damaged tomboy she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trying to change. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry, but if you think that friendship is trying to change somebody into a better person that you think they can become, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not a very good friend.\n\nBack in March, I wrote a review on my blog about a little anime called Oreimo, a title that is more or less the shortened version of \u00e2\u0080\u0098My Little Sister Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Possibly be this Cute.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Guess what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about. But despite all of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shortcomings, I praised Oreimo for having a cast of characters that make the effort to try and understand and accept each other for who they are. At least, in the first season.\n\nAnd now, you expect me to be entertained by some bullshit series where an awesome character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best friend wants to hook her up with a man so she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be more ladylike? And you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to look me in the eye and tell me that Okami-san is popular, but Oreimo is despised by people? Are you fucking kidding me? Oreimo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s writing was great until the 2013 revival, but Okamisan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s writing was bad right out of the gate!\n\nFor the first six episodes or so, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind this show. The chauvinism goes pretty deep, but it was kind of funny a few times, it was mostly harmless, and the annoying narrator was at least making one or two good jokes.\n\nIt was at about the halfway point that the low quality of the writing really started to overpower what little good there may have been. It tries to do both comedy and drama, but it never succeeds in creating a balance between the two. It can actually be pretty damn jarring at times. To summarize, Okami-san tries to go to some really serious places while struggling to take itself seriously. They even manage to work ecchi undertones into a CPR scene, for Christ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake! After seeing what Ouran High School Host Club was capable of, no anime should ever have an excuse to blend comedy and drama this poorly!\n\nThere are too many characters, and the ones that we get to spend time with normally only get a single episode dedicated to them before they fade back into the background. The narrator wears out her welcome fast, and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell nearly enough funny jokes to justify her presence.\n\nAnd if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not bad enough, this show actually seems to be terrified of itself. We never see the Otogi Bank actually pursuing a debt, because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s terrified of making the characters look unlikeable. The constant fairy tale references never really amount to anything, because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s terrified of not being taken seriously. We never find out exactly what happened to Ryoko in middle school, because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s terrified of upsetting the audience. We never see Ryoushi asking her out on an actual date, because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s terrified of exploring how such an exaggerated character would react to normal social interactions. The narrator won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shut the hell up, because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scared that the writing won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hold up on it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own.\n\nThe writing in general, is really, really bad. It constantly alternates between being insultingly stupid and just plain boring. The amnesia storyline alone is an episode painful enough to skip. The episode where a butler tries to find a bride for his ward is even worse, as he uses it as an excuse to make shallow, despicable remarks about the entire female cast before revealing that he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to be there in the first place. At no point do the characters ever act like real people.\n\nAnd the ending\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 You know what? Throw up a spoiler tag, because I really fucking need to address this. ~!At the end of the series, a rival school\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The respective hell to their heaven\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 kidnaps several main characters, and just to make things more personal, Ryoko is kidnapped and held hostage by the very man who allegedly did something violation-y to her. I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell you how this is resolved, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll sure as hell tell you how it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t resolved. Despite the clear cases of assault and abduction\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and others, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Nobody calls the cops. Who definitely exist in this universe. Would it be anticlimactic, like the end of Monty Python and the holy Grail? No, because Ryoko is being held captive by the very man who got away cleanly with something vague to her. Yeah, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take Dick Tracey to look at this scenario and start wondering if she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been telling the truth back then.!~\n\nFor the non-spoiler version\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The main villain, who is introduced with a promising bang, ultimately fades out with an anticlimactic whimper, promising revenge for a sequel series that will hopefully never come. Hell, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty much how the series ends as a whole\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Nothing is resolved, and early implications about the village being part of a social experiment filled with fairy tale references amounts to absolutely nothing. I know it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to say that someone couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t write their way out of a paper bag, but it really does seem like somebody deliberately was trying to do just that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And failing miserably at it.\n\nStrictly speaking, Okami-san isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the worst anime I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not even on my bottom ten. But you know what? I still hate it. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even hate the anime I once gave 0/10, but I hate this anime. And trust me, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very, very small list of anime that I flat-out hate. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bad enough that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stupid, full of shit, and blatantly sexist, but the way it approaches the subject of rape just tips the scales entirely against it.\n\nI haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen every anime, so I could be wrong about this, but outside of hentai, rape is a subject that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist in the medium. It can be joked about, or threatened, but it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually happen, and it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get dealt with. This is one of the reasons that Now and Then, Here and There is such a rare gem\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Any anime that introduces a plot point about one of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s characters being raped, and actually explores the repercussions and recovery of the attack, can easily be considered a ground breaking series. What frustrates me the most about Okami-san is that by introducing the rape implications in a lazy attempt to explain Ryoko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character, they actually come really close to pulling this off\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Only to pussy out at every turn. They vaguely introduce the subject when needed, then drop it cold and try to make us forget about it until the next time it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s needed. I know it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair of me to whole-heartedly condemn this series because of what I wanted it to be, rather than what it was, but what it was was no peach, okay?\n\nOkami-san and her Seven Companions was dubbed by Funimation, and can be viewed for free on Netflix. You can also find a lot of other anime on Netflix that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t suck, so don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even bother with this festering field full of fairy tale feces. It isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t well written, it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t well produced\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t well. I gave it a four out of ten the first time I watched it, but now that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve watched it twice, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s much more appropriate to give this series a 2/10."}, {"id": 3305, "score": 1, "body": "Blame is an interesting case in the anime world. While the original source \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the manga is both known and respected as a cult classic by many, it has been seemingly plagued with a handful of weird anime adaptations that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even try to be faithful to the manga, including the recent \u00e2\u0080\u0098Netflix original\u00e2\u0080\u0099 film of the same name. Because of this, the entire franchise is basically a fucking mess, and has been a complete disaster when attempted to be adapted to anime so far, with not one single adaptation being able to replicate the visual spectacle and atmosphere that made the manga so famous. But this ONA version stands out from the rest, because when it comes to Blame\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anime adaptations, this one has to be the worst one by far, and quite possibly the worst anime adaptation of a manga I have ever witnessed. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe me? Read on and find out just what kind of horseshit you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in for.\n\nBlame, the ONA version was made in 2003 by Group TAC, a studio known for their consistent low-budget animation style. While they have made some quality shows like Touch and Texhnolyze, they are also responsible for horrendous shows with the likes of Baki the Grappler and Gilgamesh, and this ONA fits right along with the latter. When you hear that a show is comprised of only 6 episodes, each running for approximately 6 minutes, red flags probably go off in your head. With only 36 minutes to work with overall, you can only do so much. But in the case of Blame, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as if they did not even try to put anything of substance into this ONA. For a franchise that prides itself off on being so \u00e2\u0080\u009catmospheric\u00e2\u0080\u009d with its setting, it falls into the worst case possible for an \u00e2\u0080\u009catmospheric\u00e2\u0080\u009d show: awful pacing, muddled tension and coming off as unintelligible and dull.\n\nThe story of Blame is set far into this dense dystopian future, where humanity has created machines to take over maintenance of overall cities, only for these machines to defy humanity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s desire and take over these cities whilst also exterminating any human they come by. The result is a seemingly never-ending cyberpunk wasteland where humans have resorted back to living tribal lives, searching for any remaining resources in order to survive. The reason why I am telling you this here is because when watching the actual show, it is impossible to come away with any understanding of the plot, and that is because in this show, there is no plot. Any sense of a storyline here is non-existent and trying to find one is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. The first episode has no dialogue whatsoever and only shows still shots and error screens for the entire runtime. The only thing that means anything in the entire episode are the error screens \u00e2\u0080\u0093 completely unintended \u00e2\u0080\u0093 because they indicate just how fundamentally broken this show is! I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even know if those error screens were meant to come up or if there was a legitimate problem on the production side. Regardless, the first episode does nothing to engage viewers into what exactly this show is about, and neither does the rest of the episode. Anyone who thinks that this show is all about symbolism with its unique choice of shots, I dare you to try and explain it, as I could only imagine that explaining it would be just as hard as explaining why this show even exists. If you are looking for anything \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeep\u00e2\u0080\u009d in this show, the most you will find is a metaphorical middle finger aimed right at you, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that needs any explanation to understand. The show is shit right from the start and moves on at a snail\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pace, whilst throwing all sorts of random events at the viewer like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fucking Oprah Winfrey giving out free stuff on her show. Except in this case, all you get is shit!\n\nA non-existent plot does not always imply non-existent character development, but Blame is the kind of terrible treat that gives us both these empty qualities. In the lifeless world and show that is the Blame ONA, there are\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 protagonists. I refrain from using the word \u00e2\u0080\u0098characters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 as these protagonists are about as artificial and empty as the overall show is. Hell, even calling them caricatures is too much praise. The show follows two protagonists, Killy and Cibo, and the most distinct feature about each of them is their hair colour. As for who they are, their backgrounds, their lifestyle, their goals, why they are here and why they fight, all of this is unanswered throughout the show. So while the show technically has characters, there is nothing to really say about them as they have no depth to them at all. Also, their chemistry in this version is absent, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as if either one of them could die and the other protagonist wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bat an eye to it. They care about each other about as much as the staff cared about quality in this entire show.\n\nWithout a proper sense of a story or characters, this show ends up looking more like an animated artbook than anything with an actual plot, and it even fails when it comes to this. Blame is almost completely devoid of animation; most shots being still pictures arranged in a poor attempt to simulate movement that only further hinders any enjoyment one could get from watching this. The landscapes, while interesting at first glance, ultimately serve no purpose and adds to the bleakness viewers have when watching the show. The cinematography here is also laughable, with the oddest use of panoramic shots, motion blur and camera angles I have ever seen in an anime. The show goes so far as to put a 360-camera rotation for no reason whatsoever, causing me to believe that the staff do not know what they are even doing nor why. The staff also seem to be unable to used colour correctly. Numerous times in fight scenes, the backgrounds change colour in what I assume is an attempt at censorship, but it looks so god-awful that it takes away from any action or excitement these scenes had in the first place. The show will also go so far as to hit viewers with a barrage of bright lights flashing on the screen to the point where I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be surprised if they caused epileptic fits to viewers. If a toddler was splattering paint all over the screen, it would probably be more visually appealing than what we got from Blame. \n\nRegarding sound, this show should have had no sound at all. If it would have been just silent, then maybe it could have been appreciated better as a purely visual piece of storytelling. But alas, that is not the case, as most of the sound that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to get from this are muffles that are hard to interpret and music that, while somewhat futuristic and fitting the setting of Blame, is just downright terrible. The voice acting is just ridiculous, having the voices manipulated to sound different, with the result being voices that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fit the protagonists at all or the world in general. The high-pitched buzzing was enough for me to believe that this was an assault to my eardrums, and it sums up my thoughts on the overall show: it seems to do more to harm the viewer than to entertain.\n\nAnd that is Blame, the ONA version. If you wanted to know more about the show, good luck because as I said before, this show makes no sense. There is nothing here worth salvaging as the staff tried to just pass off random clips and pictures from a manga as an actual story. The staff that worked on it even said that it is meant to be a bonus to the manga and should only be taken as such. But that raises the question: Why even bother making this? The answer, unfortunately, is because they wanted money. Money off of a lousy piece of trash that is supposed to be impervious against flaws as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only an addition to the original source. Well I say no. This should never be considered acceptable for a staff to put next to no effort into making anything of substance and then put it off as an extension to the original. The anime and the manga are two separate entities and should be treated as such. Making a show where you have to go to the original source to find out what happens is just lazy and greedy, and it should be called out. And the fact that this crap came out in 2003, the same year as Texhnolyze, is even more depressing. While Texhnolyze is considered by many as the pinnacle of atmospheric anime, Blame is more like the equivalent of rock-bottom.\n\nThis \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperimental work\u00e2\u0080\u009d turned out to be an epic failure that rides on the coat-tails of the successful manga it claims to have adapted from, but rather than get more people interested in the franchise, it drives them away. An incredibly bad piece of experimental cinema and one of the worst anime adaptations I have ever witnessed. It does everything an adaptation could do wrong, all while coming off as incoherent, pretentious and practically unwatchable"}, {"id": 3308, "score": 20, "body": "Hanoka might not have reached the infamy of other terrible anime, such as Skelter+Heaven, Abunai Sisters, and Mars of Destruction, but that's because there's a lot less terrible with it than those other anime shorts, which is the best compliment that i can give it.\n\nReleased in 2006, Hanoka makes the big claim that it's the first anime to be fully animated in Adobe Flash, and it kinda shows. While I have seen much uglier animation, it's easy to tell that this series animation is a bit rough around the edges.\n\nThe series also has another problem that some short series have in that the OP is way too long. Each episode is roughly 5 minutes at most, and the OP is a minute and a half. More than one fifth of each episode is purely the opening. If it was 10 seconds, there wouldn't be a problem, but every time I skip it, it subconsciously feels like I'm skipping huge chunks of an episode.\n\nWhat little story there is takes place in an indeterminate year far off into the future on planet called Tokinea, where human beings only known as \"Inhabitants of the Stars\" are attacking Humans on a planet called Tokinea, accusing them of polluting the planet with their technology. Humans have created \"Demon Gods\", powerful weapons used to destroy the Inhabitants of the Stars. This series focus' on \"Demon God 7\", known as Hanoka, and the boy who she is teamed up with, as they struggle to fight against the Inhabitants of the Stars.\n\nAnd this brings us to the series' biggest problem. The whole thing feels like the footnotes of a 12-episode series. There is clearly the faintest hint of a plot and characters, but the series is way too short to give any of it the proper depth it needs to be even remotely entertaining or interesting. On top of that, the series has a recap episode. The whole series is just barely long enough for one regular sized episode, and it has a recap episode just over half way through the series. Just why?\n\nUnfortunately, due to the Aruji Morino's (the creator of this series) failing health, the series didn't end up the way he wanted, and even he is unhappy with the final product. Maybe someone can pick this up and make it a fully fledged series, but I doubt that's ever going to happen.\n\nThe DVD actually comes with a couple of touch ups, such as new and extended scenes as well as some rerecorded and new dialogue that add some mild plot to the whole thing. There's even a prologue and epilogue that changes the whole resolution to the anime. So clearly the team behind it knew they had a bit of a flop on their hands, and they tried their best to make it better, but it didn't really work out.\n\nAs it stands, I can't recommend this to anyone unless someone is looking for an anime that has something even mildly noteworthy about it, like the fact that this is the first fully animated series in Adobe Flash or the DVD has a slightly different version.

Made to promote a mystery smartphone game developed by Cucuri for iOS and Android devices, the plot follows Detective Holmes, and his assistant Hudson, as both of them solve a case given to them by the Metropolitan Police of London.\n\nWhile the plot is basic, it is enough to get a mystery mobile game rolling. And you'd think that a short anime used to advertise said mobile game, it could lead into the games plot as some sort of prelude, or maybe be an adaptation of a small part of the plot from right at the beginning, but it isn't.\n\nIn the anime, Holmes is given a case to solve, but we don't see him solve any of it. Oh, he does solve the case that was given to him, you just don't see any of the actual detective work, with the anime instead focusing on all of the in between bits that you wouldn't want to actually see. This was probably done because of extreme budget and time constraints, but it makes the entire series frustrating to sit through. Which you wouldn't think is a problem with how short the whole thing is.\n\nEach episode is only 3 minutes, and with 12 episodes, that's a total of 36 minutes to work with. While not a lot of time, it could have been used to solve a smaller case. Or tease the plot of the game like i mentioned earlier. But instead, the whole series is Holmes and Hudson spending most of their time not solving the case and arguing about not solving the case.\n\nThe whole plot gets solved off screen. What we get instead is slapstick involving a loud and annoying landlady who continually hassles Holmes for rent, and Holmes's pet, a mysterious cat named Kira, who is more than it seems, and not much else.\n\nThe worst thing about it's measly 3 minute time limit is that a significant chunk of each episode is the opening and closing credits. So the series went from having about 36 minutes of time to work with, to less than 15. Did a series like this need an OP and ED around the same length as a regular series?\n\nThe Vampire Holmes anime isn't really worth watching, unless you need something quick and easy to digest during a lunch break. And even then, there are quite a few other anime that you could watch instead of this, such as Detroit Metal City, Inferno Cop, and the Lucky Star spin-off Miyakawa-ke no Kuufuku. Even the McDonald's advertising campaign (the Join The Crew campaign), about the girl who becomes the boss of her own McDonalds, is a step up from this.\n\nMaybe if you speak Japanese fluently, or even read Japanese really well, you could probably go check out the game instead.

But it seemed like none of them could stand apart from the crowd, rise up and be the season\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beacon of hope for anime fans.

People will write it off as just cheap otaku pandering, but that in itself is just cheap. This show is a misunderstood masterpiece as it makes anime economically a viable option to invest time and money in to. And how does it go about doing that? The only way the industry knows how: ANIME TIDDIES!!!\n\nOk. Enough with the nonsense.\n\nAs you can probably tell, Hajimete no Gal has no shame; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a show that managed to stand out from every other anime this season purely because of the amount of lewd fan-service jammed into the show. It is an ecchi high school romance-comedy anime produced by Studio Naz. Nothing in that last sentence sounds promising to me as I have only seen one anime before that belonged to those exact genres that I thought was good, that being the extremely sadistic Prison School. And Studio Naz, despite never having seen a show made from them, are responsible for the notorious DRAMA-tical Murder, need I say more. This anime from the start was pinned by many to be disaster, and while I am of the belief that shows that are predominantly ecchi are not inherently bad, I was not looking at this anime with much in the way of expectations. But I still held hope that it would not turn out as a complete disaster. After all, when one first imagines shoving a hotdog up their ass, I would expect the reaction to be rather negative. I mean, who in their right mind would ever shove a hotdog up their ass? But assuming something is different to experiencing it firsthand. Who knows, maybe one would enjoy the feeling of a hotdog inside their ass? You can never really know unless you try it, so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I did. But not the hotdog part, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still not trying that. I watched all 10 episodes of Hajimete no Gal, and this is what I thought:\n\n*NOTE: This review is purely for the subbed version.*\n\nHajimete no Gal in short, is trash. This just so happened to be one of those times when assuming a show is terrible before you even start was the best course of action for many anime fans. It follows this generic-looking pervy dude in high school named Junichi who has next to no confidence at all and is a virgin \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this feature being seen in a negative light because in this kind of anime, of course it would. He is portrayed as a pathetic loser who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s saddled with a trio of friends even more pathetic that all lust over women, read porno magazines openly and ultimately keep Junichi from having any real chance at getting laid. But one day, the three stooges force Junichi to confess to the sluttiest girl in school that they know as some sort of prank. Junichi being the weakest character in the entire show goes through with it and somehow\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it worked. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cgal\u00e2\u0080\u009d he confessed to, Yukana Yame, knows that all Junichi is after is sex, yet she decides she wants to go out with him. This is implied that she seems to take pleasure in teasing him and making fun of Junichi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s insecure self, but that maybe there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more to Junichi that Yukana likes that will be developed as the show continues. With this kind of premise, it is obvious that the show is on the trashy side of anime, but the setup did show promise. The relationship at first looked like it could turn out alright, and the way characters were introduced as common caricatures in a harem anime gave the possibility to break the stereotypes within the sub-genre, leaving us with a show that, whilst trashy, has some substance that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth the watch. Unfortunately, the hope was all for nought as it turned out to be another shitty harem series.\n\nFrom the first episode, we are shown every female character that will eventually be a part of the harem: the stereotypical main \u00e2\u0080\u009cgal\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yukana, the big-titted loli Nene and Yui, the Asian prefect (who just so happens to be the only female with a cup size below D). Honestly, their appearances are the only features that matter, because when you take away the T&A, they are all basic bitches that are only there for the sake of the harem and that never changes. Remember that these women all have the feelings for Junichi, the pinnacle of \u00e2\u0080\u0098self-insert male protagonist\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that is so bland that in no way can anyone similar to him get the kind of attention he gets. The only female that makes logical sense to be in his harem is G-cup jail-bait Nene, and that is only because of their childhood friendship. Yukana has no sensible reason for spending so much time with Junichi, especially considering how she first met him after seeing him read a porno magazine with the rest of his doofus friends \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the future child offender included. Yui is only after Junichi because of this weird fetish for controlling men like him, despite how Junichi seems to be the only guy in the entire show that she is ever interested in, paying no attention to any of his fellow virgin friends. Yukana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friend Ranko is another character prevalent in the show and is the only girl that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want Junichi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s virginity, but she has as much development as the rest of the cast here \u00e2\u0080\u0093 none. Also, fun fact: Ranko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character design is a rip off of Mito from Food Wars. The only viewers that I can imagine liking these characters are the ones who screenshot specific clips for \u00e2\u0080\u009clater use\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nThe male characters are no better, with each character being completely one-dimensional, cringeworthy and an embarrassment to any man with integrity watching this. Junichi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best pal Shinpei has one purpose in this entire show: to act as Junichi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wingman. You might be thinking somewhere along the lines of \u00e2\u0080\u0098well that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty shit\u00e2\u0080\u0099, but at least he has a reason to be on screen. The blonde-haired guy of the group, Keigo has no reason to even exist! I had to look up his nam because he was so irrelevant. He has so much hollow characterization that he could have switched spots with Junichi as the generic protagonist and the story would have stayed the exact same. But the worst of them has to be Junichi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fat ass friend Minoru, who openly admits that he is a paedophile with no shame whatsoever. This guy even says that 15 year old girls are \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo old for him\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 this is a new low folks. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even more cringe is how these little shits seem to nearly always talk about online streams of cam girls when together in school. Hajmete no Gal already shows numerous couples groping each other in public in the first 5 minutes. But when it comes to showing how much of a cesspool the setting is, it goes above and beyond, and that does nothing in the long run. It may be laughable at first, but it only adds to the pile of manure that this show shits out on a regular basis. \n\nSaying that the characters was the only problem is a massive understatement to how far down the toilet this shit sank. The plot is fucking horrendous. It tries to show progression with Junichi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship, but only focuses on random events that happen as the couple gets closer with each other. This type of storytelling makes it difficult to structure plot elements unless there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good writing behind it, but there is nothing that has been said in this review so far that in any way indicates good writing. Overall, the structure is a mess, riddled with contrivances that destroys most of any chance of development for Junichi and Yukana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship. From the very beginning their chemistry is about as authentic as the lead duo from Fifty Shades of Grey and by the end you are either questioning what was the point of all this, or just gave up on the reasoning and continued watching for the \u00e2\u0080\u0098plot\u00e2\u0080\u0099. The dialogue is also dreadful if you ever take the show seriously. And even then, the script writers probably never gave a shit about trying to make anything quality when you hear lines like this come out of nowhere:\n\n_\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll I want is a dope pussy to fuck.\u00e2\u0080\u009d_\n\nAll I want is some god damn respect shown from staff to viewers that take time out of their day to watch this content. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe to say that this show has no respect for even telling a competent story, let alone its fanbase. The consensus around most harem anime is when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen one, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen most, but this is such a failure that it ends up as a shell of the common harem anime. There are a lot of problems with this show, and it does not help that there was only 5 episodes that actually had storyline progression. Yes, out of the 10 episodes the staff had to tell the entire story, only half of it has anything remotely meaningful. Producing Hajimete no Gal like this made everything feel incredibly rushed, to the point where there is no possible way that anyone watching this had time to get invested in these characters and care about what is happening on-screen. But wait, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, because along with a rushed plot, viewers are subjected to watching full filler episodes dedicated to fan-service; the kind of content you would expect from a show like Fairy Tail. From the compulsory beach episode, to the entire harem getting a job at a cosplay caf\u00c3\u00a9, they are a waste of animation resources. And after persevering to the end, I have concluded that there is nothing that this adaptation did that could be considered a positive \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it is a terrible adaptation and a terrible anime in general!\n\nNow while it is an awful show with nothing redeemable when it comes to story and characters, the animation and sound is what saves Hajimete no Gal from earning a 1/10. The animation style is usually very common with romance-comedy anime: standard designs with bright, dynamic colours. There were a few jarring points, like how pink lines used for characters blushing go off the side of their face, and the last episode looking more like it came from Chronexia and the Eight Seals. And while it is overall generic and looks very unremarkable compared to similar anime, technically I found it to be just ok. Maybe I have just become desensitised to anime breasts drawn the size of watermelons but it never bothered me anymore than how sloppy the writing was. However, there is something that I want to get off my chest and that is how there is an uncensored version of Hajimete no Gal that has no reason to exist. I watched the uncensored version, therefore I expected uncensored material, yet all I saw were a couple panty shots that got censored in the \u00e2\u0080\u0098safer\u00e2\u0080\u0099 version. How in the world are you going to censor panty shots in an ecchi show? Even worse, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still censorship in the NSFW version. What the fuck!? So even if you were only watching it for a weekly wank, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d probably have better luck with a handful of other anime from this season. Kakegurui would be a better choice for that reason, even with the \u00e2\u0080\u0098look at me I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so CRAZZY!!!1!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 expressions. Sound-wise, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fine: J-pop opening and ending with basic OST\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, nothing more. Voice-acting was good, with emotions coming through the characters well. Production-wise, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fairly competent, and I would be lying if I did not say that I thought some moments were absolutely hilarious. The best scene overall was definitely in episode 6 when one of Junichi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friends dressed up as Kirito from SAO in an attempt to impress some ladies, comedy gold! Sadly that moment only lasts for 10 seconds, and those kind of moments cannot compensate for how terrible the show was overall and in no way saves this show from damnation. \n\nAnd thus, these are my thoughts of Hajimete no Gal. There is more that I could have stated, but honestly this show is not worth any more time and effort that has already been given. The show is a throwaway anime that lives solely to sell blow-up sex dolls and lewd posters of the female characters to otaku fans that will buy into this garbage every season. It is a piece of trash that continues to wear down the ecchi genre and ultimately makes me ashamed to be a fan of anime in general. My advice: Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t watch it, and if you do want to watch it, stop, and go back to my original advice. Unless you plan on watching the dub, and even then, only watch if you're in the mood for some trash."}, {"id": 3321, "score": 25, "body": "_\u00e2\u0080\u009cPart of it went on gambling, and part of it went on women. The rest I spent foolishly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d_ \u00e2\u0080\u0093 George Raft.\n\nTo those of you who have watched Kakegurui I ask: Why did you watch this anime? Were you intrigued by the aesthetic look of the show? Or maybe what drew you to Kakegurui was the concept; gambling! The latter was what caught my eye, as past experiences with gambling anime have proven that they hold some of the most entertaining and exhilarating moments I have ever seen. These shows have given me goose bumps from sheer awe and admiration while watching psychological battles of wits and strategy between people willing to risk their very lives on even the simplest of games. Unfortunately, these kinds of anime are extremely rare to come by, as nearly all of them are practically unknown to most of the anime community and nearly impossible to watch any of them legally. So when I saw that Kakegurui was airing this season and also happened to be the most popular show of Summer 2017, I was pretty excited. I had heard good things about the manga and it was being produced by Studio MAPPA, a studio that I have high hopes for despite not being impressed with any of their previous works. All that was left for me to do was watch it, and this is where the hype for this show died for me. I was disappointed with Kakegurui from episode 1, because even after just one episode, it is obvious to see that Kakegurui is a terrible gambling anime.\n\nKakegurui takes place in Hyakkaou Private Academy, a prestigious school where the student are the most wealthy and privileged students in all of Japan. I use the term school lightly because there seems to be no actual classes or learning happening, instead the school is more like a gambling den, where every student partakes in gambling. They bet their fortunes against one another regularly, and those who become in debt are practically slaves to the holders of their wealth. The show focuses of Yumeko Jabami, a new student who gambles for the fun of it and is really good at it; too good, in fact. Her actions end up disrupting the student hierarchy of Hyakkaou Academy, causing the Student Council to come up with ways to stop her. Throughout the show, Yumeko befriends beta cuck bitch-boy Ryouta Suzui and fellow gambling gal Meari Saotome who help her as she gambles to her heart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s content. Ironically, Yumeko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first gamble at the academy is against Meari, and it is here where the first major problem of the show lies.\n\nThe game Yumeko and Meari play is a card-game variation of rock-paper-scissors where the crowd of people watching them write the symbol of \u00e2\u0080\u009crock\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cpaper\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cscissors\u00e2\u0080\u009d on cards, where they are collected and put into a box for both players to draw three cards and play the game. Meari manipulates the majority of the class\u00e2\u0080\u0099 votes to her advantage, however Yumeko still wins decisively and reveals exactly how Meari cheated. Throughout the entire game, the audience is given no insight into what Yumeko is thinking or even a hint as to how she was able to figure out Meari\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scheme until it is given through exposition after she has already won. As such, viewers are forced to believe Yumeko was able to piece everything together without fault. Doing this is lazy of the writers as it solely relies on having to tell the audience what happened, rather than show it as it is happening. This problem is apparent in every gamble in the show and kills the opportunity for viewers to engage with the gambling games and the characters playing said games. The games themselves are also poorly constructed; some come off as unnecessarily complex, others are just too simple and easy to beat. Being marketed as a gambling anime makes the show look incredibly dumb and retarded, taking away the chance to get excited for how these games play out. And that leads to what I feel is the 2nd biggest issue with this anime: no thrills.\n\nAs you watch Kakagurui, you begin to notice a couple patterns with each gamble: High-stakes are never fully realised, every female character is bat-shit insane and \u00e2\u0080\u009cYumeko wins LOL\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Seriously, even when Yumeko loses like in episode 3, she has no repercussions from losing. Because the audience is always watching from the perspective of either a mere onlooker or one of Yumeko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opponents, she always comes across as too good for every situation she is placed in. Because of this she rids the show of any tension it could have had. And when you figure out that most of the time Yumeko gambles, she barely even uses a complete strategy, relying on pure luck to win at random times, which feels like a slap in the face to anyone expecting consistency and/or intelligence from this show. The fact that there are no actual punishments fulfilled from losing a high-stakes gamble also hinders the joy and excitement viewers get from watching. Now while there are consequences for being in an extreme amount of debt (e.g. house pet, Meari\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cLife Schedule\u00e2\u0080\u009d), you never actually see the show go through with these consequences and even then, the punishment for losing rarely ever matches the reward for winning. And in Yumeko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case, the money she wins never really matters to her at all. She is the kind of sadomasochist that would throw countless amounts of money away to feel satisfied with how high the risk of losing a gamble is. Yet the show never goes through with these risks. So I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m left here after watching each gamble asking myself \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the point?\u00e2\u0080\u009d. A lot of fans of the show have been saying that Kakegurui is not a gambling anime, but a great thriller, and I just cannot agree with that statement at all. It is a mediocre thriller at best and that is only if you turn your brain off.\n\nSpeaking of which, this show stretches one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suspension of disbelief so much that you would think this has the quality of fanfiction-level writing. Not just with the gambling aspect of it, but the entire setting is fucking retarded. From the very start I was always curious why there were so many students at Hyakkaou Academy and why they would all gamble. But as I continued watching, the curiosity turned into frustration because it became apparent that there is no proper reason why so many students would stay there or continue to engage in gambling than to make Yumeko even more perfect than what she already is. Yumeko exposes a lot of the games played in gambles as cheat ways to get other in debt, yet that never changes the amount of gambling that takes place within the academy, and that is because most of the students in the background are ignorant buffoons. I would also like to know why only one adult to my memory has appeared in the entire 12 episodes. ONE! I cannot imagine such a prestigious academy to only have one adult working at the academy, but it makes sense with the amount of betting that takes place so regularly. And how in the world are guns and kidnapping allowed? And why does being in extreme debt eventually lead to a life sentence that dictates you to a wealthy future? So many questions that are never explained because this show is not about logic. It tries to look smart but just comes off as a dumb piece of shit. Calling this show psychological is pure lunacy; if anything, it is psycho-sexual because any real sense of logic got thrown out the fucking window!\n\nNearly every character in this show pissed me off. I have already stated how Yumeko is convoluted out her own ass and is like a vacuum sucking all the excitement away from the show, but she seems like God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gift to this show when compared to every other character. Meari, who seemed like she had potential, starting off as a cocky bitch that is humbled by Yumeko before being humiliated by the student council. Sadly, she turned out to be a weaker clone of Yumeko by episode 4 and is only used as a way to explain other games Yumeko plays as the story goes on. Fucking waste of potential. Ryouta is their other friend, but honestly he does nothing in this show. He just reacts to shit happening around him and nods in response and is a waste of space. Fuck him. The only other characters that matter are the one-note members of the student council that only matter for the one episode they are in before getting pushed to the side. Dishonourable mention to eyepatch-girl with the revolver fetish and a chronic masturbation habit, edgy bitch. Although, there is this one supporting character who literally tried to rape Yumeko that was unironically my favourite character purely for that one moment. If a bitch was lowkey killing the quality of my show I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d tell her to bend over and take it too. All kidding aside, every character is awful in their own way and make the show even more predictable and boring.\n\nRegarding the production, from a company like Studio MAPPA I was really disappointed. The art style is not impressive, most of the female character designs are generic, backgrounds are fairly basic and visual effect are for the most part impressive. The most controversial feature of the animation has to be the facial expressions and I have mixed feelings about them. On one hand, they showcase how broken and mentally unstable these characters get at times, but these faces just do not fit the visual look of the show and come off as cringe-inducing to me. The fan-service used is also off-putting to me, seemingly thrown in at random intervals in each episode. Yumeko pretending to be a cat was a definite low point for my enjoyment and did more to prove to me that it cares more about sex appeal than anything of substance. The music used was fine to me, with the OP being perhaps the best part of the entire show, which is not a hard feat. The ED however, was nice to listen to once but afterwards was always skipped, as I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see how Yumeko walking for 90 seconds as her breasts bounce constantly is worth seeing more than once. The voice acting was fine until characters went into their crazy stage and felt artificial and forced, but I suppose that fits the show unintentionally.\n\nIn conclusion, Kakegurui was pretty awful, filled with formulaic, villain-of-the-week gambling matches that felt like a waste of time once it was all over. In the end it was only trying to entertaining on a superficial level; it was never attempting to have a real identity, besides being yuri fapbait. Now I have no problem with anyone who liked the show; you are free to like and enjoy whatever anime you want to, but if someone were to ask me if I enjoyed it? HELL NAW. Lemme put it this way: If you liked Mirai Nikki and Akame ga Kill, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll probably enjoy this. But if you are anything like myself and thought those two shows were terrible, Kakegurui ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t gonna be worth your time. Now if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll excuse me, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m off to watch something that is actually worth my time."}, {"id": 3322, "score": 40, "body": "Nagisa Aoi was just an ordinary girl. She wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t especially smart, she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t especially pretty, she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t especially noble\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 There was really nothing special about her. Then, one day, she transferred into Miator Academy, one of three all girl schools located at the top of Astraea hill, a sacred place where no males are allowed to enter. The three schools are affiliated, and they only accept female students from proper, upstanding families\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one other possible qualifier, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll talk more about that later. Students are expected to live on campus in two person dorm rooms, and as a right of passage, first year students are expected to act as maids for their elders. Luckily, Nagisa was able to avoid this fate, transferring to the school in her third year of education because of\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Reasons\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And it was at this school that the once ordinary Nagisa would become\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, still an ordinary girl. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no evidence that that part of her is ever going to change. But somehow, despite this ugly duckling slowly growing into an average duck, there is one thing about her life that is about become extraordinary.\n\nFor you see, at these three schools way up on Astraea Hill, they elect more than just a student council\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They also elect an Etoile, who represent the school in all of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glamour and prestige. For now, the Etoile is Shizuna, a tall mysterious girl with long white hair and a spirit that radiates with ennui and depression, and for seemingly no reason at all, she appears to have taken a very special interest in young Nagisa. From long measuring glances to sudden, uninvited embraces that come within a hair\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breadth of ending in a sultry kiss, the most beloved and respected student on campus has her empty eyes on Nagisa, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re filling up fast. Nagisa has no idea how she attracted this kind of romantic attention, but luckily for the older girl, she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to be in any hurry to try to lose it, either. As the two young ladies become closer, and the bond between them begins to form, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find that the Astraea Hill School System is both a political and social minefield, full of backstabbing, sabotage and political intrigue. Will our perfectly ordinary heroine brave the dangers of Astraea Hill for the sake of a love that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s truly extraordinary, or will her destiny fall short in the end?\n\nThe Strawberry Panic anime was produced by Studio Madhouse to capitalize on the successful magazine run of a series of short stories, all focusing on different all-female romances taking place at the Astraea Hill Schools. Productions from Madhouse rarely ever have generous amounts of money poured into them, which can lead to even beloved classics like Trigun looking wonky half the time, but on the plus side, some shows can still flourish visually without a lot of financial backing, like the dialogue-heavy Death Note. Well, Strawberry Panic may have a lot of dialogue in it, but the nicest thing I can probably say about it is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the worst looking anime I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen. They clearly tried their hardest with it, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only so much a bare bones budget can do when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attached to a light, fluffy show that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the benefit of heavy shadows or obscure angles to hide it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flaws. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m honestly not sure how good this show even COULD look, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clearly the kind of show that Kyoto animation was born for.\n\nMadhouse tries to hide the limitations of this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movements, and for the most part, it does manage to pull it off, relying on as many staticky conversations and panning shots as it possibly can, and it treads water at least well enough to\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 well, not enough that the shoestring budget goes unnoticed, but well enough that you can ignore it and focus on the story. Having said that, the very second the motion needs to pick up even the slightest bit, the returns can be flat out embarrassing. Characters walking often look like profile images bouncing up and down as they move across the background, a tragic horse accident in the latter episodes is clumsy enough to bring inappropriate roars of laughter to what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supposed to be somber scene, and if you can tear yourself away from the beautiful piano melody in one particular scene, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll feel duped when you realize that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just looking at a panning shot where a couple of frozen characters just move their upper arms ever so slightly. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even watch a character fall down the stairs on screen, no, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very intentional cutaway.\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a nice looking show in terms of design, however, as every named character has a specific look that you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forget, even if you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen them or thought of them for extended stretches of episodes. In fact, I got so used to having their looks inform their identities that towards the end, I briefly mistook one of the main characters for being two separate girls all because her hair was sometimes down. Their designs are generic, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at least different enough to distinguish one girl from another, and the use of different uniforms for each school also helped this to happen. Miator has black uniforms, Spica has white uniforms, and Lulim have yellow vests paired with checkered skirts, all three of these designs being popular ones from the history of high school anime. Oh, and of course, there are also maid outfits present. The backgrounds are serviceable enough, and although it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really have anything to do with the story, the architecture is also really pretty to look at. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a lot of flowers\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yeah, I know, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a yuri, big surprise\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not just border decoration, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a greenhouse full of them, and a lot of care clearly went into their rendering.\n\nAs I mentioned before, whatever beauty the visuals may lack is made up for tenfold with the soundtrack. The instrumentation is mostly comprised of violin, piano and cello, and while the standard slice-of-life music that occurs while nothing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really going on can be a bit on the underwhelming side, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of melancholy and pain in this anime, and the music translates this beautifully. There are a couple of classical songs that are played when Shizuna and Nagisa are bonding over the piano, the instantly recognizable but still very well-chosen Moonlight sonata and Maiden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Prayer. As for the original music, Yoshihisa Hirano put together a powerful score that almost manages to lend gravity to the melodramatic nature of the series. There are several emotionally gripping moments that work hand in hand with the score to rip your tear ducts out through your throat, But at the same time, honestly, there are several moments in this show that are so uncomfortable that the music will wind up being the only thing you WANT to remember them for. Kaori\u00e2\u0080\u0099s theme tends to be a popular favorite, but I strongly prefer the tension present in Unmei and Fui ni Semararete.\n\nThe aversion to movement is unfortunately carried through to the first opening, which appears to do the bare minimum on a visual scale, showing the different characters in leisurely glamour shots, reacting to the camera before the next character can get their spotlight. The song, Shoujo Meiro de Tsukamaete by Aki Misato, is a fine song on it;s own, a little on the generic side but still well orchestrated and catchy. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good enough op, but it;s also a really predictable one, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad the second opening threw all of this convention out the window. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s called Kuchibiru Daydream, once again by Aki Misato, but it comes off as a lot more lively and inspired, with more force and flow behind the vocals. The imagery in this opening is also a massive improvement, as it still kinda reeks of budget restrictions, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s able to do a lot more with it on account of the fact that it TRIES to do a lot more with it. This mirrors the level of effort present in the anime, which started off a little lackluster before picking up steam towards the second half.\n\nThe endings, surprisingly enough are mostly live action. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see that very often nowadays, and for good reason, but these ones actually do manage to skew past the awkwardness thanks to the chemistry of the two ladies on screen, Mai Nakahara and Ai Shimizu. They also happen to be the singers of Secret Dolls, which has a distinctive goth-rock feel to it. Makes sense, I guess, since they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re both all dressed up in goth-loli costumes, which I would consider overkill if it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fit the doll theme so well. They sell the yearning between them mostly through facial expressions and clever directing, and finish by sealing the song with a kiss. The same two singers reprise their roles for the second ending song, Ichigo Tsumi monogatari, which is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 A thing. A really weird thing. It goes off in an entirely different direction with creepy singing paper cut-out CGI, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all fine compared to the fact that the energy and set design remind me of Hi Hi Puffy Ami Yumi, which is one of those things nothing should ever remind me of . So yeah, the second opening and the first closing were really great.\n\nAnd since there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no English dub, I guess we should get right into the writing, huh? Well, I do have a few comments about the Japanese sub, even though I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m woefully underqualified to judge Japanese acting. First of all, there are a lot of times where the lip flaps didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t match the voice of the people speaking, which is a mistake I thought only dubs could make, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a shame that I was only able to watch it with subtitles, because I had trouble keeping up with the dialogue whenever my eyes started to involuntarily close over how bored I was. Oh yeah, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re starting on this note; There are a few things Strawberry Panic is known for, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pretty sure one of them is just how much of a train wreck the story and plot are. That is, when there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even story and plot present. Right off the bat, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re introduced to some meek little redhead with so special or distinguishable characteristics in a cast that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already bloated from the start, and while it feels like you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supposed to care about her, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re never told or shown why she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth that kind of attention.\n\nThe only interesting thing we learn about her\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Possibly ever, now that I think about it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Is that she has the ability to uncontrollably run through forests like she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a WWE wrestler waiting to encounter a rope to bounce off of. Aside from Shizuna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abrupt attraction to her, nothing else of consequence happens for a very long time. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re dropped into a story that has at least a dozen characters, little to no attempts at world-building, and a bunch of creepy non-consensual almost-kisses being our only clue as to what or who we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supposed to care about. I would honestly recommend keeping a pillow handy during the first six episodes, and on and off after that, just in case you decide that a dream might be more interesting than what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on onscreen. It meanders through fields of inconsequential fluff before it ever approaches anything resembling a point, wasting time on characters who wind up getting shoved to the side anyway, including almost everybody from the Lulim school, like a loli with a teddy bear, a pair of useless girls who I just wound up calling Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, and one named Chikaru who I wish was important, because she feels really likeable.\n\nThere is a point, of course, but it takes an inexcusably long time to get there, and even then, there are problems present. The actual meat of the story is the romance between Shizuna and Nagisa, and while you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re never really given a clear reason as to why Nagisa would develop feelings for the older girl, Shizuna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attraction to her is VERY well defined, and while I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spoil it here, it carries an admittedly compelling layer of conflict and tragedy to the idea of the two of them being together. Besides, while Nagisa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feelings may be undefined, they still feel more than real enough to make the audience genuinely care where their romance goes. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not the only major romance, though, as there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another sub-plot involving an equestrian and a young blonde student, and it starts out okay\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really sweet and heartwarming at first, then it dives into a bit more drama as it evolves into a love triangle, but it all goes south as the two villain characters standing in their way get drawn in, making it a love pentagon, with enough going on in it to make it feel beyond convoluted, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s BEFORE the hokey-as-fuck amnesia plot twist.\n\nHonestly, thinking back, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m tempted to say that Shizuna is the only character in the cast who really feels developed and fleshed out by the end. We know what happened to her, why it happened, how it started, how it made her the person she is, and how it motivated her actions in the present, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of room to interpret whether she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a selfish character, a sympathetic character, or both. For the most part, everybody else has personalities that have been defined just enough to differentiate them from each other, but their personalities are almost entirely informed by their role in the story and their interactions with others. With the exception of a few girls from Lulim, you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any trouble remembering who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s who, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have a hard time caring for any of them, aside from the two main couples and maybe Nagisa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s roommate, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a hard maybe. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll probably wind up hating the little girl with the teddy bear\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, a lot of people seem to, I personally just ignored her\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And there are a few characters who, after they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve disappeared for a while, might just coax a \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, I remember you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d out of you when they appear again.\n\nBut you know what? There was one story arc where everyone generally came out looking good. Yeah, some of the best moments in the series take place when Shizuna and Nagisa are alone(depending on your tolerance for questionable levels of consent), but the one arc that really worked as an ensemble was when the three schools decided to put on a play. They pick the European classic Carmen, and just about everybody plays a fun role in this arc. Egos are challenged in the cast listing, Nagisa gets a little extra depth, the villains get to be nasty for what feels like no real reason, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intrigue and last minute improvisation, beautiful costumes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The problem is that it only lasts two episodes, despite spanning a period of several weeks. In a smarter anime, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have expanded this arc to at least a quarter of the show, using it as a backdrop to other less consequential stories, tying them into it so that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be something to look forward to through other boring or forgettable moments.\n\nBut they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do that here\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Strawberry Panic never comes near the level of effort or inspiration that it would take to come up with a solution like that. Well, fine, you wanna get lazy? There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another solution they could have tried\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Cut the length of the series down to 13 episodes. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a ton of material they could have cut, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry to say, as pleasant as it was in the beginning, the entire Hikari/Amane/Yaya thing could have gone bye-bye along with it. I mean, seriously, would anyone miss that sub-plot? They could have cut the story down to just focusing on one school, Miator, and still had enough time to develop Nagisa and the few supporting characters around her more properly. The problem is, and I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe more people haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t noticed this, is because this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a show you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supposed to think about. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supposed to be drawn into the emotion and the romantic and political intrigue, because if you stop to think about what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching for one second, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll realize that very little of what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing makes even a lick of sense.\n\nFor example, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be the only one who found the Etoile system to be confusing as fuck. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s see if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got this right\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an elected position where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re basically an ornament, meant to uphold the beauty and nobility ideals of the school, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not the Student council president, even though you have to sign a lot of undefined papers. You apparently keep this position until you graduate, which can take up to six years\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 If you follow the plot closely, Shizuna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been doing it about three years\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vital that you have two of them, but if you lose one for whatever reason, they just carry on without making any attempt to replace her. Oh, and you can be from different grades, so what happens when one graduates and the other hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t yet? And are you supposed to be a couple with your partner? If not, why would you have to run away and abandon the election just to be with the person you love? And why do the people in charge tell prospective candidates that they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a choice when they clearly do? And why is it okay for one school to not submit any candidates? Is any of this explained in the source material?\n\nOn top of that, I had trouble understanding why every girl we meet who has even the most slightly established sexuality is a lesbian. Yeah, okay, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a story about lesbians, but the context it creates feels really weird, like the story exists in some post-apocalyptic society where men have gone extinct. It kind of feels like it was influenced by the Japanese Romantic Friendship custom, where adolescent young women are able and even encouraged to engage in close, emotionally strong bonds with one another, although such bonds are strictly platonic, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expected to leave it all behind when they grow up so they can marry and reproduce. One show that took a harsh metaphorical look at these customs was From the New World, which took Romantic Friendships and evolved them into more sexual territory, but Panic takes it into a different direction, treating these bonds as actual romance\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The difference being that unlike New World, Panic ignores the effect these relationships might have long term. Nobody ever brings up what their futures will be like once they graduate and reenter Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heavily patriarchal society, which almost makes the series feel vapid. It has no stakes.  I was honestly confused by the conflict in the final episode, which made no sense from too many angles to count.\n\nNo, I know exactly what they were going for with this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an escapist fantasy. You know, the kind of story where the reader can experience a situation or lifestyle that would be impossible or really troublesome in real life. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unrealistic by design. This series was written for the viewer to escape into a world full of beautiful girls who want nothing more than other beautiful girls, with no conflict outside of their romantic woes and social standings. Now, is that a bad thing? Honestly, it depends on who the fantasy is designed for. A lot of lesbian media is intentionally designed to exploit queer people for the sake of fetishizing them for the enjoyment of straight males(To be fair, yaoi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market is just as bad), and that was my initial impression of the series. Of course, there was also the possibility that the lesbian fantasy in this show was created as an escape FOR lesbians, especially when you consider just how badly oppressed they are in Japan NOW, let alone in 2006 when this series was released. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an important distinction to make in cases like this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it for?  On the one hand, it creates an environment where same-sex relationships are the norm, and are explicitly romantic in nature, which sounds nice, but it also refuses to acknowledge said relationships ever leaving the school, which leans more heavily towards the idea of homosexuality being a phase you grow out of, which is more of a patriarchal idea.\n\nTo try and answer this dilemma, I took to social media, and asked for anybody who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seen the series to let me know what they thought of it, along with their gender and sexual preferences. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get a lot of responses, which isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very surprising when you consider how personal a question that is, but what was surprising was that the few responses I did get were from queer women who had generally favorable opinions of it. They were well aware that the show had issues, and that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s problematic in spots and a little dumb, but they all said that when they watched it as teenagers\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Remember, this show is now 11 years old\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It helped them come to terms with their sexualities, and even taught them that it was possible, even okay, for a woman to have romantic feelings for another woman. They even said that the material that was obviously meant for titillation was just as enjoyable for them as it was for presumed straight male viewers, barring the few non-consensual moments. Admittedly, my sample size was small, but it was still very revealing in terms of what it means to the people I thought it was just exploiting. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not much, but it does earn the series a little redemption in my book.\n\nStrawberry Panic is available from Anime works, a division of Media blasters. The 5 disk thin pack has unfortunately doubled in average price since it was released five years ago, but used copies on Ebay can be found at a reasonable price. The original novels are available stateside from Seven Seas, and the original manga is available from the same company.\n\nWhile the process of reviewing this title has been enlightening, my opinion on it has remained largely unchanged. I still consider it a train wreck, full of random fluff, way more characters than it could handle, and an ending that was entirely unsatisfying and wound up raising far more questions than it answered. Having said all that, I do understand that it has an important place in LGBT anime. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tackle the struggle to define ones\u00e2\u0080\u0099 self, as Utena did, and it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t satirize the oppressive patriarchal society of Japan the way Yurikuma Arashi eventually would, but it does manage to present the idea of same sex romance in a somewhat progressive way, and I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really fault it for that. It presents an escapist fantasy where queer women both younger and older can set aside the idea of forbidden love and guilt so they can just feel normal in a world that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s constantly telling them they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not. I still can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t justifiably call it a good show, but at the very least, I do now know that there are people out there that I can confidently recommend it to, even if that demographic is a small one. I give Strawberry Panic a 4/10"}, {"id": 3323, "score": 30, "body": "We all remember our first love. It happened in high school for most of us, middle school for a few of us, and much later in life for those of us who were less fortunate. It was that shy, awkward time in our lives when our hormones were raging, our need for intimate one-on-one companionship was impossible to ignore, and after putting forth more and more effort until it felt like we were just screaming our ears off into a dark abyss, we finally managed to convince the object of our desires to invest some time in us. Well, that, or you were the one being persuaded, and you eventually gave in and relented, but either way, we finally found somebody that we could call our own\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Somebody we could say was ours, to spend all of our free time with, all while people gossiped behind us about what may or may not be going on behind closed doors. For the first time, we found somebody that we wanted to do all of that mushy stuff that grossed us out when we were children with. We were finally one half of a couple. You never forget something like that.\n\nFor Mei Tachibana, first love isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the subject of nostalgia\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming for her, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming hard. While she was used to spending time by herself, avoiding all of those phony, blood-sucking, backstabbing social circles who have burned her before. With no interest in impressing anyone, Mei retreated into the background, not wanting to attract any attention to herself\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Which, ironically, attracts the attention of Yamato Kurosawa, the most attractive and infamous boy in school. Having fallen in love with her at first sight, Yamato will stop at nothing to make her his, even while admirers, a former flame, a famous model, and even his own little sister try to compete with her for his attention. She is of course attracted to him as well, but how can she let down her defenses for him, when she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been hurt before? How can she give herself over to someone, to trust him as he trusts her, when she has no idea what his intentions are, or what a plain, ordinary girl like her can possibly offer someone as perfect as him? Oh, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a troubled young girl from Forks\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Um, I mean, Japan, to do?\n\nSay I Love You was animated by a company named ZEXCS, which is apparently pronounced like Zekushizu. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever come across that name before, but they were also partially behind the production of Diabolik Lovers, so I must have. Taking a closer look at it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history, it was apparently formed by a former JC Staff producer, and yeah, now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m starting to put this company into context. The work that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen from JC Staff have been wildly varying in terms of quality, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m kind of surprised to say that in this case, we have a title that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wildly varying in quality all by itself. Say I Love You was clearly a low budget series, as evidenced by the plethora of shots where people are frozen in the background like mannequins, stuck in time in the middle of their conversations, but it overall isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bad looking animation, either. Thankfully, this kind of show doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to be heavy on movement, as a lot of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story is told through inner monologue and long wistful stares, so the constant dips in budget don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ever get too distracting.\n\nWell, I say that, but the material they may have wasted a bit too much on is also present more than a few times. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say saving money for the sake of scenes that require more movement is a bad thing, but the frozen backgrounds become a bit less forgivable when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got money to waste on pointless shots like animations of children running at a distance as well as other similarly blurry, shaky-cam looking shots that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still not sure what they were trying to do with. Like I said, though, this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a genre that really needs to be told through a lot of movement,and considering how fluid the little movement it has actually is, this show actually looks slightly above average compared to others of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ilk. They put a lot of effort into making basic motions and interactions such as minor scuffles and walk cycles look realistic, even if characters freeze a bit too often when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking to each other. Aside from the few key visual tropes of a shoujo anime, character designs skew towards realism, and while the backgrounds are adequate overall, there are brief moments where the artwork and lighting are so beautiful that you might actually forget the few nagging budget issues.\n\nThe music for the series has a very pleasant tone to it, as do most Shoujo based soundtracks, but this particular composition by Yuuji Nomi just had that little extra bit of effort and diversity behind it. Some of the tunes are a bit loopy, and can become annoying when played on endless repeat in the background of scenes where nothing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really going on, but the ones with actual purpose and intentions behind them are kinda genius, using a number of different instruments to bring a soft, melodramatic feel to the story. From the xylophone to the violin, every note is played with the right atmospheric pace, with vibrations in all the right places to convey the wavering hearts of the cast. Unfortunately, the opening theme Friendship by Okazaki Ritsuko, is a bit more on the generic side. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re heard a shoujo opening song before, then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard the one, which honestly just feels like a bland version of the op from Fruits Basket. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not necessarily bad, per se, but you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss anything by skipping it, and the same goes for the ending.\n\nLikewise, the English dub isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bad, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really kind of unremarkable, as it mostly just goes through the motions. Honestly, they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even bother matching the lip flaps in a lot of scenes. Actors Greg Ayres and Monica Rial, who should have been breaths of fresh air in any dub they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in, play disappointingly close to their most common typecastings, with Ayres playing the pervy girl-crazy best friend, and Monica playing the likeable, bubbly best friend. The same could be said for Andrew Love, who once again plays a somewhat dimwitted tough guy role, but since he gets misused a lot easier than those other two, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just consider his playing to type a good thing. If there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an especially sour note among the cast, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Leraldo Anzaldua, who I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never been a particular fan of, and they gave him the lead role. His approach to the character seems to almost be inspired by Robert Pattinson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach to Edward Cullen\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Play him as you see him, even if that interpretation is a negative one, and Leraldo plays Yamato like a wet rag with all the personality and enthusiasm you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d expect if Shyamalan was directing him.\n\nThere are a few beaming lights, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Caitlynn French does a way better job with Mei Tachibana than the role actually required, all while giving just as honest a portrayal as Leraldo gave. She plays the role as sometimes bitchy, sometimes preachy, while never becoming unlikeable in either tone, and she even made her character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s depression feel a lot more crushing than the original Japanese seiyuu did. There are some lines she had to speak in this show that were downright uncomfortable, and probably not by design, and she still did surprisingly well with them. Emily Neves was also a gem as the snooty, duplicitous Megumi, and while that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not really a surprise as she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always been a bit of a chameleon, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really get the full effect of it until she breaks down towards the end of the series. Oh, Brittany Karbowski and Tiffany Grant also get small parts in this, and while that alone should be a selling point, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re roles are limited, both in time and in content. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really condemn the dub, as there are a few really good performances in it, but I feel like if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m being honest, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gotta recommend the sub.\n\nYou know, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not immune to the charms of a good shoujo anime. I really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think anyone is, even if they protest that fact. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re like anime chick flicks\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Sometimes, even hardcore action and gore fans need to sit down for a feel-good viewing of The Princess Bride. Likewise, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve yet to meet an anime fan that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enjoy Princess Tutu and Ouran High School Host Club, and while those two shows do deliberately contain a lot of dual appeal, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really mind the more stereotypically shoujo anime, either. I liked Fruits Basket. I love Ikuhara\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work. Those of you who remember my Vampire Knight review will know that I consider the first season to be a major guilty pleasure. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind the giant eyed heroines with absurdly rendered pupils and eyelashes. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind skinny bishounen males with haircuts that are ultimately dated because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re based on whatever\u00e2\u0080\u0099s popular at the time. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got nothing against the genre or it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tropes, so I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want you to think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m biased when I say that my first time watching this series, almost exactly one year ago, I dropped it after three episodes.\n\nBefore I get intro why, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s go over some of the more persistent problems hiding right in plain sight just beneath it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flowery surface. Starting with the main character, Mei Taniguchi, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re told early on that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like other girls. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like the gossipy girls who play social games for their own benefit, and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also not like the girls who alter their natural appearances to impress guys. Okay, we know what she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not, but what is she? We know she has a tragic backstory where some rotten kids blamed her for something they did wrong, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s caused her to become distant and bitter even several years later, and we know that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s honest, and occasionally has wisdom to offer people, but aside from all that, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gotta be honest, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of boring. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a textbook Mary-sue character, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only real flaws are her shy nature and mistrust of others, and she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do a whole lot to solve these problems. Other people do. Hell, she rarely ever makes progressive or active choices as a protagonist.\n\nAnd her boyfriend Yamato Kurosawa is even worse. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really my biggest problem with him, but his biggest problem is objectively the fact that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so damned inconsistent. There are a ton of examples I can bring up, but I feel like one of the most obvious is when we find out that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a virgin. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s explained to us that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really selfless and kind, and he slept with a girl because she made him think it would make her happy. Well, this happened in the same episode that he invited himself along on Mei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trip to the salon to get her hair cut, but he immediately hijacked her plans in order to take her out on an abrupt date. She misses the salon, upon which he says that he likes her with long hair. Oh, NOW you have an opinion? Your pants fly off because a girl asks for your dick, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re totally a martyr, but when a girl thinks her hair is getting too frizzy to manage, THAT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll voice your opposition to? When it comes to character development, actions speak louder than words, and his actions in this case just felt controlling and manipulative.\n\nAnd that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not even him at his worst. People often give him shit for kissing Mei without permission in order to get rid of her stalker\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Which, while effective and somewhat excusable, feels a bit overkill. As a wise red dragon once said, never play an ace if a 2 will do. They seem to forget that in the same episode as the salon incident, towards the end, he catches her hiding and watching him, and takes the opportunity to kiss her without permission again, ultimately pinning her against a wall and kissing her into submission. If she hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been receptive to that, she could have had him behind bars for sexual assault. He ditches her for hours in the middle of a date because his friend had something to give him, he went over to another girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house for weeks after school without telling Mei, and he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even make a habit of asking her what she wants to do until the final third of the story\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Up until then, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s do this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou should\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d I am honestly convinced that the anime adaptation skipped over some info dump about him suffering some kind of brain damage as a child, to explain the way he behaves throughout the series.\n\nSee, this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just a shoujo romance series. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something far more insidious. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a self insert wish fulfillment fantasy boyfriend series. Mei isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t supposed to be an interesting character, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supposed to be a blank slate for the audience and presumably the writer to imprint themselves onto, so that they can live out the experience of having a popular, handsome boy getting all up in their business. Yamato isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t supposed to be an interesting character either, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supposed to be an unobtainable dreamboat who only has eyes for the main character, much to the dismay of, like, oh my god, the entire school. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like Twilight without the sparkling vampires, or 50 Shades of Grey without the BDSM and torture devices. Hell, the only torturing device involved was my own DVD player. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get me wrong dudes are guilty of this too\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 We tend to get a lot of stories that depict us as badass loners who get bothered by sexy girls who fight with us but eventually succumb to our awesomeness through no real change of our own, like Steins;Gate and Sword Art Online, but Say I Love you takes this concept to a special new low, because I have a very specific person in mind who might be dreaming it up.\n\nJust for fun, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like you to imagine Tomoko from Watamote\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yes, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really doing this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Alone in her room, bitching about the people in her life, when all of a sudden she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like \u00e2\u0080\u009cWouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it be awesome if the most popular boy in school fell in love with me? That would show all of those losers. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be obsessed with me, and it would be because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m different. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not like all of those back stabbing bitches, or those tramps who slather on gallons of make-up to whore themselves out to boys. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll fall in love with me at first sight, and he wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take no for an answer. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not easy, though, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d play hard to get, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d come at me kind of rough, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s okay, because we both know we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be together forever! He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d even turn down a model for me\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 no, wait, he IS a model! Oh shit, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d better write this down! I can make a manga out of this!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And then after two hours of brainstorming, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like \u00e2\u0080\u009cOoh, and then his friend comes back, and he totally falls in love with me because we like the same theme park, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d totally fight over me! Oh, and we get a hotel room, and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Nope, gotta think of my demographic. nothing happens at the hotel because he respects me, and while he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more experienced than me, none of what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done before me matters, because none of it involved me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mindlessly self-indulgent right down to the fact that backstabbing classmates are used as a constant source of antagonism, as well as being basically what every named antagonists\u00e2\u0080\u0099 backstory boils down to, and no attempt is ever made to humanize them. They come close to it as part of Megumi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s backstory, when they abandon her in favor of someone she refused to invite, but even then, the abrupt decision and hive mind element to the scene make no sense. Actually, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of occurrences in this anime that make no sense, from Mei and Yamato leaving a festival early all because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re friends decided to go home(They seriously wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take the opportunity to be alone?), to Yamato\u00e2\u0080\u0099s creepy relationship with his sister, who he seems to act as both the parent and the crush of, to how easily Megumi comes undone over her inability to ensnare Yamato, even though she literally just decided out of the blue that she wanted to date him based on his looks. The tragic part is that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clearly a rip off of Ami from Toradora, who was a much better written and explored character.\n\nEarlier in this review, I referred to the relationship between Mei and Yamato as their first love, and I did so for a specific reason\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It was my attempt at gently stating that, in all likelihood, it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be their last. Not only are such romances doomed to fail in real life, but the one between them isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even based on a solid foundation. Yamato\u00e2\u0080\u0099s love for Mei was decided and settled upon based entirely on his first impression of her, and he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even bother getting to know her before imprinting on her. Outside of his good looks, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see what Mei sees in him, outside of his persistence and refusal to give up on her. Their love, respectively, is superficial and circumstantial. He didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even open her up to other people, like she claims\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Once he picked her, other people came to her out of curiosity, through no effort of his own. In their own mutually exclusive ways, these two characters don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even know what love is, and eventually, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but get the feeling that their relationship is destined to end with tears and heartbreak, with the school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new power couple splitting up, and honestly? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m okay with that.\n\nWith most high school anime romances, even the bad ones, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re given a sense of purpose in the two of them staying together\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Even in a shitshow like Clannad, where I wanted Tomoya to get remarried after his wife died, he was still destined to marry Nagisa before anybody else, as their emotional codependency formed too intense a connection to break. In the Love Hina manga, we get to see over time how the spineless dumb-ass Keitaro was able to win Naru\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart. In a good show like Toradora, you know enough about Ryuji and Taiga\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friendship and backgrounds that we know they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make sense with anybody else. In Say I Love You, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get a sense of any of that. If they were to break up, with Yamato dating Megumi and Mei winding up with Kai, those relationships wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily last forever either, but it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel like some major tragedy\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It would just feel like \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, part 2 of the story!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And yeah, with this being the worst case scenario, the series lacks any real stakes, making it kind of tedious to get through. Honestly, the final episode was a joke, with the two of them being separated by a series of phone tag related coincidences. Yawn.\n\nSay I Love You is available from Section23 films both on Bluray and DVD, and can also be viewed on Crunchyroll. The original manga by Kanae Hazuki is available stateside from Kodansha comics, and the live action film is apparently not available in the US, but from what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not such a bad thing as even fans of the anime and manga find it soulless and bland.\n\nMuch like the shoujo genre, I really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have anything against melodrama, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a much clearer distinction to be made with that material\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Melodrama tends to work best when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self aware. Anime like Bento and so many shoujo titles outside of this one were written by people who knew that the stories they were writing didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t measure up to much in terms of stakes, so they compensated by amping up the emotions, infusing character development into the plot, and using themes to add flavor to what was going on. Say I Love You tries to do this, with a breaking bracelet symbolizing a broken heart, and cats getting along when their owners do, but for the most part, it does the bare minimum, creating a bad romance between two 2-dimensional characters that has no reason or power to stand the test of time. The music and the animation are above average, and to be fair, Mei and Yamato do become a lot more tolerable of a couple in the final third when Mei starts to show a bit more initiative and Yamato starts to treat her more like a person, but I think a romance where the guy sounds ten times happier about his new kitten than about his new girlfriend leaves a lot to be desired. I give Say I Love You a 3/10. "}, {"id": 3348, "score": 30, "body": "Daizoburo Edi-Ban Is a young American-born Japanese man, descended from immigrants and raised to uphold a strict sense of morality. He joins the New York city police force, precinct 34, intending nothing less than to enforce the law, punish evil, fight crime and defend the innocent. His idealistic nature is stressed to the breaking point when he finds out that his partner, whether he likes it or not, is a veteran cop named Johnny Estes, who carries two nicknames\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Sleepy, probably for his chill and laid back nature when he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s off the clock, and Mad Bull, for his violent, uncontrollable nature that he slips into whenever he slips on the badge. A long time loose cannon who would rather spend his time making the rounds with every prostitute in the tri-county area than patrol his assigned area, and to whom questioning live suspects just feels like a waste of time and energy, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take very long for Officer Estes to show his impressionable rookie partner what the inside of a rapists\u00e2\u0080\u0099 brain looks like.\n\nBut as the two cops become closer\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Or, as Daizoburo slowly slips into the trappings of Stockholm Syndrome, which seems equally plausible\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 He begins to see the good nature of his giant burly buddy, as well as the method behind his bull-headed madness. Unfortunately, his trouble doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t end there, as Mad Bull\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cShoot first and ask questions to the splattered skulls later\u00e2\u0080\u009d tactics have earned him more than a few enemies throughout his storied career, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always willing to make a few more! With this giant, over-sexed, trigger happy senior officer by his side, Daizoburo will have to deal with rapists, gangsters, drug dealers, witness protection and a serial-killer who won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop targeting cops, all while struggling to defend his ideals, the general population, and his precious virginity from the very person he was expecting to help him do so. Welcome to the concrete jungle, my friends, because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got fun and games, so strap on your grenade jock strap and take a bite out of the big apple.\n\nHey, did you know there used to be a production company called Magic Bus? If so, then that makes one of us! Seriously, though, talk about obscure. If this thing isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t owned and operated by Miss Frizzle, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure what reality is anymore. Anyway, obscure is definitely the right word for this company, who appeared in the mid eighties and put out most of their work in the nineties, including nine straight years of Legend of the Galactic Heroes. They seemingly went quiet in 2006, having produced only two shows between then and now. Mad Bull 34 was an OVA series that they released over the course of two years. It was released in the early nineties, so\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, you can probably guess from there what kind of animation you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in for. The visual quality of this series is so low budget that even though it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s extremely dated, I highly doubt it was even considered acceptable for it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time. It does kind of work in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advantage, as the low quality does sort of add to the overall tone, making it feel more like a bootleg video of a grindhouse movie, and yeah, that is a pretty good fit.\n\nEven considering this, however, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a really ugly looking show, which is especially hard to ignore in the first episode, where it looks like the producers haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even begun to figure out how to use budget cuts to hide their weaknesses. They get better at it in the third and fourth episodes, or in other words the second half, but the result they achieve isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really as effective as they were hoping, because while it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look cheap or badly animated in those episodes, it does look very obviously like budget cuts are being used, and that is an improvement, but not a huge one. No matter what episode you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching, however, the budget was clearly reserved for action, as the best looking moments in the series are the gunfights, the gruesome dismemberments and exploding heads, and the admittedly fun car chases. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say any of it looks good, per se, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best moments look mediocre at most, but the rest of the on-screen material\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And I do mean the rest of it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Suffers to help the action to even look THAT good.\n\nThe artwork is very roughly drawn, much like the backgrounds, although they did accurately capture the shitty and decrepit feeling of most areas in New York city. Character designs, despite falling to the same issue, are inspired and distinctive, as long we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re referring to the main hero characters. The villains are much more generic and samey, as most of them could be described as stock thugs, with a few rare muscle-bound black guys and sexy femme fatales to break up the monotony. A lot of the women who appear throughout the series, most of whom are either prostitutes, victims or both, are just big boobed, long haired blonde chicks with very little variation in their appearances. The heroes, who are among the very few featured people, are kind of unforgettable, even the one who looks just like all the other blondes. One of the tricks they use to make Mad Bull and Daizoburo memorable was through their drastically different heights, with the title character towering over all he meets, and the actual main character, an obvious audience cypher and the moral center of the group, is quite possibly the shortest man in Manhattan. Oh, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a villain who wears a costume that looks like a cross between Green Goblin and a Xenomorph.\n\nWith only four 45 minute episodes under it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s belt, there really shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be a lot of music, but each episode has at least ten different tracks in it. The music was seemingly entirely produced by one man, English rock guitarist David Ross Skinner, and while it does carry an authentic New York City cop drama feel to it, the homogeny does show, as there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually very little variety to the music. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say any of it sounds bad, as a lot of it is actually pretty cool sounding, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only so much you can get out of a soundtrack that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comprised mostly of slow tunes for \u00e2\u0080\u009cmoments,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and high tension tunes for the action. Most of the ending themes were contributed by a Korean band called Maizurah, who can sing in what sounds like pretty impeccable English, but perhaps more surprising is the fact that the ending theme of the very first episode is a song from the Godfather of soul himself, James Brown. Yeah, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m making that sound more impressive than it is, because James Brown is all around amazing, and yet they still managed to find one of his lesser songs. I seriously think Time to Get Busy is the result of Brown completely forgetting the lyrics and just not giving a fuck.\n\nThe english dub, on the other hand, is pretty awesome. I know that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weird to say about a dub from the nineties, especially for the dub of a low budget OVA, because these things normally sound like the worst things ever, but the actors in this title just have so much fun with what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re given. This is especially true of Allan Wenger, a man with so many voice credits to his name since 1978 that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a crime wikipedia doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a page on him. His dubbing resume extends to animation from a laundry list of countries, with relatively few coming from Japan. In any case, he plays the title character as dumb, cocky and bullheaded, but at the same time with enough laid back presence and good humor to make him feel more like a lovable doofus than a psychopath with a badge. Alan Merriott has a much more pronounced anime history, and as Edi-ban, he skews a lot younger than his co-star, and he does so with a much deeper accent, which easily sells the idea that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just transferred into this precinct from another county. Of course, both actors do have perfect accents and pitches for their characters.\n\nSpeaking of perfect accents, the prime female character, Perrine Valley\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, she certainly has an accent. Her stint in anime voice acting appears to be a hiccup in her primary career as a British TV actress, including appearances in a 2007 Doctor Who spin-off. This is probably the reason she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only British character in the entire series, a fact that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never explained or referenced in the dialogue. She barely has a presence, reads off her lines as stiff and blandly as possible, and is completely overshadowed by the female characters who are introduced in the following two episodes. Unfortunately the dub gets a little muddled from here, partially due to the many names on it that only appear in this specific series\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Which is normally a sign that fake names are being used\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And while several black thugs in the series are credited under the name Wesley Powell, I think I can distinctly hear Beau Billingslea in their performances. I could be wrong, but Beau is awesome, and if these stock thugs were being played by an actual black man\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Unlike the anime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only black female character\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I could see him wanting to keep his name off of it. This show can get pretty racist, after all.\n\nIn the time that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been writing for this blog, if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever said anything negative about an anime you like, and you disagree with me, I respect your opinion, and would love to hear what you love about it that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Granted, when a series offends me in some special way, I may argue with you, but I will at least acknowledge that you have a point that needs making. What I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t respect is when people defend an awful series by saying, in so many colorful ways, that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s immune to criticism. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t claim that any of my points are wrong, just that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re moot\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 A series can be terrible and get away with it because it was never trying to be good, or it was aiming to please an audience that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m apparently not part of. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen this argument used in defense of titles like Gantz, Kiss X Sis, Stella Womens Academy, and an untold number of old, shock-filled OVA series, when really, the only form of media I can justifiably see that defense applying to is actual porn. With any other form of media, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no reason why you shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go in with standards and expectations, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not nit-picky for having them.\n\nFor example, a lot of people love yaoi anime, because they want to see two hot guys bang, nevermind the fact that the situations are often highly rapey and the characters are infantilized. People like yuri anime because they want to see two hot girls getting it on, nevermind the fact that neither of them feel like real people in even the shallowest of contexts. People love romance stories even when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sexist and abusive as all hell, with special nods to Twilight, Fifty Shades of Grey and Say I Love You. Yeah, I said it. I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anything wrong with indulging in your guilty pleasures because the thrill you get out of it is worth all the questionable crap you have to ignore, but to defend it as a profound piece of literature or awesome despite it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flaws when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just ignoring the things you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like is insane. Yeah, I love caviar, but if you spread it on a piece of your dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dried up shit, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to stuff that shit into mouth for some caviar\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to say \u00e2\u0080\u0098No thank you, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like the next batch to be on a cracker, please.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOn that note, do I have a low opinion of Mad Bull 34 because of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s excessive violence, sex and misogynistic attitude towards women? No, because I actually have a rather high tolerance for these things. I enjoy Elfen Lied and Sword Art Online, after all, despite what the mediocre scores I gave them may suggest. The reason Mad Bull 34 fails to impress me is entirely due to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s writing, and if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re scoffing at me for not taking it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ridiculous and tongue in cheek nature into account, guess what, I did. There is no form of literature or entertainment, save for literal porn, that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t subject to the quality of its writing, and yes, that includes exploitation media. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s such a thing as objective quality, or that all forms of media should be united under one unifying standard, but if I have an opinion on something, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to express it in depth and in detail, with no regard for what the piece was trying to do, or who it was trying to entertain. Except with Mad Bull 34, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really NEED much in the way of detail, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to prove it by going episode by episode.\n\nThe first episode, so gracefully titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cHit and Rape,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is the story of how Edi-ban met and formed a bond with Sleepy Joe Estes, and out of the entire series, this one probably contains the most violence and sex. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind that so much\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 What I do mind is that the whole episode plays like a glowing, self-indulgent self-insert fanfic written by someone who wishes they could be a giant, musclebound stud. He gets flaws in later episodes, but Sleepy Joe is SUCH a Mary-Sue here. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the pinnacle of justice, everybody loves him, and the people who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t are either the villains he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inconveniencing or people who just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand him. He gets to have a ton of anonymous sex with hookers for free, but none of them mind, because he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a totally nice person who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s paying to have their STDs and rape trauma treated, even though he demonstrates early on that his form of breaking woman out of shock is to penetrate them anally. He murders criminals for bullshit reasons, following convoluted logic that the rest of the world just blindly accepts, because he is Joe, and he can do no wrong, even based on a guess so farfetched that Sherlock Holmes would pump the breaks before acting on it.\n\nThe second episode tries to be better, as it introduces a strong female character\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Of course, by this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s standards, strong means \u00e2\u0080\u0098not a prostitute,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and like most female characters, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty much just there to get in trouble, get assaulted, and show the audience her tits. I honestly don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember much about this episode unless I really think about it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I recall the villain being more obvious than Doctor Evil, Sleepy being able to survive half a dozen bullets to the ass as well as a point blank grenade explosion to the face, and to be fair, one of the most epic moments in anime history\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Sleepy Joe pulls off his pants to reveal that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tied a few dozen grenades to his pubes, which his partner starts to pluck and throw at a bunch of 1930\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cartoon mobsters. Honestly, that moment is probably why people remember this series at all\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They sure as hell don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come back to see Daizoburo miraculously rise from his death bed, all of his teeth suddenly intact, after a phony marriage ceremony helps him recover from what should have been a fatal beating.\n\nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to give away too much of the last two episodes, for spoiler reasons and the like, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just going to lump them together here. The third episode involves a plot between a politician and a reporter that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so confusing, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s honestly hard to keep up with, and our heroes get tied up in a witness protection story where everybody keeps making decisions that are stupid and contrived beyond belief, the backstory to the situation we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re dropped into is told to us and never shown, and apparently a politician can buy his way out of being positively identified by ten murder-scene rape kits, and with that much power, a lone reporter shooting her mouth off somehow poses a threat? And then you have the final episode, which started out really good, with a villain from Sleepy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past come back to haunt him, killing more male police officers than the Russian chick from Kick-Ass 2, and it seems like the series will go out on a great note before a sudden reveal halfway through turns it into the most bafflingly awful love story since Elfen Lied. It does say something about your ability to write villains when the first one that has a remotely understandable motive gets treated like a fucking saint.\n\nIf any of this interests you, which I can understand, then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in luck\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 After twenty years of obscurity, it was rescued and released stateside on DVD in 2012 by Diskotek Media, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been doing a lot of that lately. You can find it at a pretty decent price, too. Unfortunately, the original manga, which I can only imagine is superior due to that usually being the case, is not available, nor is it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sequel, Mad Bull 2000.\n\nI hope by this point I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve proven to you that my problems with this title go far deeper than it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so-called shocking content. Your sensibilities may differ, but for me, offensiveness is a matter of context, and not content, and no matter how bloody, over-sexed or misogynistic the material got, I just couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t muster up enough interest or investment in the story or characters to GET offended. It was so stupid and badly written that even when graphic rape was occurring on screen, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel sorry for the victims, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel angry at the villains, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel disgusted by the tastes of the writer, I was just bored, staring blankly at the screen and waiting for any\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Any\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ridiculous shit to be as entertainingly bad as the crotch grenades were. And speaking of entertainingly bad, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly what this series is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 You invite some friends over, you get drunk enough to think your reflection is picking a fight with you, and you laugh your asses off at how desperate this series is to try and make you remember it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not anywhere near one of the worst anime I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never recommend it to someone on the assumption that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll genuinely, soberly enjoy it. I give Mad Bull 34 a 3/10. "}, {"id": 3349, "score": 40, "body": "Shogo Mikadono had been living a comfortable, carefree life up until high school. As the only child of the Mikadono group, a wealthy network of the Mikadono family and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friends and business partners, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been selected as the sole heir to the company and family name that his father, Kumagoro Mikadono, has dedicated his life to strengthening and expanding. Unfortunately, on the day of his ageing father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death, when Shogo is finally given a taste of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s written in the family patriarch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s will, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revealed that in order for the young heir to inherit his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very lucrative estate, he must undergo one final task; To enroll at a certain high school, fall in love with a dignified and agreeable classmate, and make her his fiancee, with whom he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be sharing untold riches on the day of their marital vows! It might not be the most romantic grounds for a proposal that anyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ever heard of\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Still beats the idea of having to come together to repopulate the earth, when you get right down to it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But for a rich man to marry an attractive woman who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only interested in business and money isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a new concept, and it certainly isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t unheard of.\n\nHowever, as is the unfortunate pattern of life, even the simplest plans must become complicated somewhere down the line. Not long after hearing about this stipulation, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s confronted from just out of reach by a soft, reassuring voice that he won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always be alone\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 That the owner of the voice is his long lost sister, who has every intention of marrying him and staying by his side forever. Wait, did I say soft and reassuring? Because I meant deeply concerning, as it turns out that his father did in fact father an illegitimate daughter who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been separated from him since birth, and to make this revelation even more shocking is the fact that the girl with the voice is also going to his new school! Now, his attempts to pluck a bridal rose from a garden full of crazy weeds is being hampered by the fear that one of his sultry suitors may actually be his secret sister! This matrimonial minefield is made even harder to cross by the fact that with each step that moves him forward, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being confronted by red herrings that are only pretending to be his sister for their own ends. Can Shogo safely pick the woman of his dreams and collect his rightful inheritance, or is the only thing he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bound to inherit a deformed child and a one way ticket to Alabama?\n\nYou know, the longer I do these reviews, the more likely I am to cross every single animation studio off of my list at some point. This time around, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about Studio Gokumi, a company that spun off from Gonzo in the early 2010\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. The name literally means Studio Group 5, which\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. I have no idea what that does, or even COULD mean on a larger scale. In any case, they haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t done very much work, although I have seen two of their shows before, namely A Channel and Yuki Yuna is a Hero, two shows whose best qualities were their visual qualities. A Channel, like most of Gokumi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s early work, was low budget, but managed in such a way that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lack of funds could never hurt it in any noticeable way. Yuki Yuna, like most of Gokumi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s later work, was gorgeously animated with a lavish budget that the producers took full, appreciative advantage of. Between the two, Nakaimo is closer to A Channel, being one of the studio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earliest projects, and it looks way better than it really needed to look, given the nature of the material.\n\nTrue to form, Nakaimo looks perfectly fine. The visuals aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind-blowing of world-challenging, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re more than serviceable enough to be above complaint. The animators were very clearly working with a tight budget, so the movement on screen is never exactly fluid, but the characters still move just as much as they need to to convey a sense of life. There are shortcuts taken, which is kind of inevitable in such a situation, as movement occasionally has to be limited to save some money, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never prominent enough to bother even the most astute viewer. Not to mention, these shortcuts pay off with interest when the show DOES want to dazzle us with more impressive shots, such as one of the main characters swimming in beautifully animated water, or when they need to show us random CG effects like a can flying at someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head from off screen. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said before that given the choice, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d prefer a well-managed low budget over a lackadaisical high budget at least seven times out of ten, and Nakaimo easily delivers on what I wanted to see from it.\n\nThe artwork is also very pretty, with it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only real flaw being certain shots where the background has an unnatural sort of heavenly shine to it. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen often, thankfully, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s irritating when it does. The backgrounds are fairly well drawn, and while most man-made backgrounds to have a surprising level of intricacy in their design and range of details, things like grass, trees and bushes do blur a bit when you look at them closely. The characters themselves are drawn to type, milking the most cliched archetypes of the ecchi genre dry, extending all the way to the teacher being a little girl. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got the cosplaying loli, the pigtailed flat-chested tsundere, the overdressed goth-loli sweetheart girl, and of course Itsuke from Haruhi as the protagonist. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s saving grace is that once you get past the clich\u00c3\u00a9s, the characters are still designed and drawn really well, although the constant blushing can get extremely annoying. The lighting and filtering effects are also utilized well, if not very often.\n\nThe soundtrack is a bit on the generic side, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not bad by any means. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very pretty in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orchestration, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also really repetitive, as any given track just loops around every few seconds or so. It does it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job well enough, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll hardly notice it, unless it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing the one thing about it that impressed me\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Instead of playing off the little sister mystery as sexy or romantic, moments dealing with the mystery\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 AKA phone calls allegedly from the sister and certain off-color remarks tying into it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Are paired with music that actually manages to make the concept feel creepy or ominous, which is how it damn well should feel, so props for that. The opening theme, Choose Me Darling by StylipS, is your typical fast, catchy song from multiple harmonized female singers, but what makes it awesome is the percussion underneath it, which creates a pretty memorable beat. That, and i\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pretty sure a decent amount of the animation budget went into it, as it makes for a pretty awesome watch, and it goes out of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way to introduce the characters and several plot points that happen throughout the show.\n\nThe English dub was produced by Sentai Filmworks, and before I start doling out the praise\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Of which I have plenty to go around\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to have to go into some negatives, because Nakaimo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dubbers made two huge mistakes. First of all, I was shocked to see that Steven Foster wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t on this dub. Yeah, he quit a while ago, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve only ever seen lip-synching this bad under his direction. In his heyday, his response to the critics blasting him for his translation choices was to release dubs where he stayed true to the original Japanese right down to the letter, and stopped giving a fuck about lip flaps. These were his *better* dubs, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m kind of assuming the company figured out from him that they can do this to save some time and effort and still remain on peoples\u00e2\u0080\u0099 good sides. This purely speculative explanation, whether true or untrue, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t excuse the final product, where characters talk while their mouths are closed and stop talking while their mouths are still open. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s over-all a pretty sloppy job, but the other mistake is even worse.\n\nSee, there are several voice actors in the anime industry who have immediately distinctive voices. I like to bring these individuals up as\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 How can I put this gently\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Target practice for beginner voice chasers. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need much experience in voice chasing to recognize voices like Greg Ayres, Luci Christian, Monica Rial, Brittany Karbowski, J Michael Tatum or Hillary Haag, because while these are all fantastic actors, they can not disguise their voices for shit. This usually isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a problem, as you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to be a chameleon to be a good actor, but Nakaimo presents a unique circumstance. The plot of the story revolves around finding out which member of the harem is Shogo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little sister, and right in episode 1, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re given a brief clip of the sister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s real, unfiltered voice. Sentai was clever enough to not credit this voice, but it uses the same actor as the eventually revealed sister character, and they used the most distinct-sounding voice actor they had. They could have used Emily Neves, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually really good at disguising her voice, but nope! Even the most unseasoned of viewers can figure out the mystery as soon as the sister talks again.\n\nFor this reason and this reason alone, I almost want to recommend the Japanese track with subtitles, as the sub didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make this mistake, but if you did that, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be sacrificing what actually turns out to be a pretty awesome dub. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll admit that Clint Bickham is a bit awkward in the beginning, but he grows nicely into the character before long. Monica Rial and Brittany Karbowski play his two most prominent love interests, and of course, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re more than reliable even with the worst material, which is good, because by the end of episode 1, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve respectively gushed to themselves over how puffy and cream-filled their boobs are and tried to badger Shogo into sticking his tongue into them through convoluted logic. I would not trust lines like this to any other actors, so thank god the director knew what material to drop in front of what actor. Most of the actors are newcomers and less-popular names, with the exception of veteran Tiffany Grant as the trio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s homeroom teacher, and while everyone does a pretty damn good job, none of them stand up enough to be brought up on the same platform as our three leads. If it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for the serious misstep I mentioned earlier, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d tell you to skip the dub and watch it in Japanese\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 You know what? Screw it, just do that. Good acting isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worth spoilers.\n\nOff the top of my head, I can pick out two genres and one trend that have dominated the anime landscape in recent years, earning an equal amount of ire from anything but the lowest common denominator of the anime viewing community. These genres are Harem and Moe, and the trend\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 One that many critics wish would just go away and die already\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Is incest. Specifically little sister incest, because incest without focus apparently isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t abrasive enough. The harem genre has been a mainstay for decades at this point, and in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trek through time, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s become one of the laziest, samiest things imaginable. I mentioned earlier that the characters were drawn to type, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because there are a lot of repetitive types to draw from. Moe hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been around quite as long, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s become just as repetitive with it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sexist characterizations and shameless melodramatic tragedy porn. These three elements are copied and pasted to death because they work\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 People flock to them, both here and especially in Japan, so nobody bothers changing it. That would be all well and good, if it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for the crushing feeling that people pushing out this material know damn well that they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to try.\n\nWell, this was more or less what I was expecting when I bought the series on DVD, but I was very quickly astounded to notice just how much this series DOES try. It puts forth genuine effort to be more than the some of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parts. If you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t had the mystery spoiled for you\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Which means you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re probably watching the sub\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a shockingly good mystery, played out through a story that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way more interesting than anybody should justifiably expect it to be. A character is introduced in episode 2 who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supposed to be the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stand-in for one of the worst harem tropes imaginable, the ever insulting \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrap\u00e2\u0080\u009d character, and while I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell you just what their deal is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be more satisfying that way\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I can think of two reasons the character was introduced. The first I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to later, but the second ultimately makes them my favorite character in the show. Instead of acting as a member of the harem, they exist to help Shogo unravel the mystery of his sister through their epic set of ninja investigation skills. This in turn adds a little more depth and attention to the plot, which can often be forgotten among the tons of fanservice.\n\nThe story has many twists and turns, and a handful of the characters do get individual arcs, which is a common enough way for a story like this to explore each member of the harem, but Nakaimo does it a little differently. While each arc ties into the fleshing out of an individual character, they also revolve around the mystery of his sister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s identity, with each one setting up what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supposed to believe is a new red herring for him and his gender-neutral ninja sidekick to discuss and solve. Each character with the exception of the student council president has their own backstory, their own tough circumstances, and their own reasons for getting tied into the mystery. What they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have, however, is individual reasons to pursue Shogo, because guess what? Half the harem don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even really want him! Only three of the six girls compete over him, with the other three busy pursuing their own interests that he may or may not be relevant to. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pretty sad commentary on the repetitive nature of the harem genre that THAT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a breath of fresh air. Having said that, I liked these characters, underwritten as they may have been, and I genuinely cared what happened to them. Shuffle and Maken-Ki didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make me feel that way.\n\nAfter all that praise, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re probably expecting me to call Nakaimo a genre defying masterpiece, right? Oh God no. It may be one of the better products of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s genre, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a product of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s genre, and as such, it comes with a lot of the same trappings. When it comes to the writing that carries the series to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full run, coincidence is the rule, not the exception. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard not to roll your eyes at how the different arcs incorporate themselves into the little sister theme, from a girl claiming to be his sister to promote her little sister maid cafe to the entire school thinking Shogo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so awesome that calling him Big Brother becomes a trend. Even when the plot gets really interesting towards the climax, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 DO\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 A climax, and very little is actually followed up on. Also, I should probably mention that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a ton of nudity in this anime. Not only that, but they go out of their way to show every female character named at some point\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, thankfully, this excludes the little girl teacher. I generally separate nude scenes into categories of integral, incidental and forced, and while Nakaimo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s are all over the place, most of them feel forced. Hell, the other reason the gender-flip character exists is to guarantee maximum flesh output. Seriously, their excuse for casual nudism makes the chick from MGS who breathes through her skin seem legit.\n\nOh, and by the way, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re one of the special little snowflakes who gets triggered when they hear a work of fiction called \u00e2\u0080\u0098sexist,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 you might want to jump on over to one of my other works. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t call a fictional work sexist, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stupid, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not real!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yeah, well, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a reason the term pop culture has the word culture in it. The way you write people is a reflection of the way you view them, and the popularity of the work is a reflection of how accepted that mindset is. Nobody watches Coal Black without thinking \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s racist.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On that note, there are several character constructs of the harem genre that I consider sexist, and while Nakaimo only hits a few of them, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still really bad. Girls holding onto a crush for well over ten years is sexist and unrealistic. Girls becoming obsessed over a boy over a misunderstanding that makes her think they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re betrothed is sexist and paints women as idiots. Girls being so thirsty for the D that they claim being a pedophile is better than being gay is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give them this, at least it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a new one. But it still ties into the harem genre\u00e2\u0080\u0099s age-old insistence that girls will obsessively want the self-insert male character, and through him, the lonely male viewer.\n\nIf there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one area where this show actually did come close to impressing me, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s with the actual little sister character. While the series begins on a note that some sexy, exploitative Imouto hijinks are about to go down, you find out by the end that while the plot line is wildly misguided, it does manage to follow a more scientific interpretation of incestuous feelings, ala the idea of Genetic Sexual Attraction. In a nutshell, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been more or less proven that when two blood siblings aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t raised as siblings, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re genetically predisposed to find each other attractive later in life, and yeah, Nakaimo does adhere to this, whether intentionally or not. Unfortunately, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think the writers really know what they had with this material, because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an uncommon enough subject matter that it still deserves to be taken seriously, and some serious groundwork needs to be laid down before it can ever be approached with this level of ecchi kitsch. I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spoil how the series ends, obviously, but like with all of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other promising aspects, it winds up dropping this ball pretty hard. Like I said before, I do appreciate it for trying.\n\nNakaimo, My Sister is Among Them is available from Sentai Filmworks, and can generally be found on Blu-Ray and DVD at a very generous 30-40 dollar price range. The original light novel by Hajime Taguchi is not available stateside, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m kind of feeling like that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good thing, because it continues way longer than the anime, and some of the spoilers I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard about the extended story have been pretty cringeworthy. The manga adaptation, illustrated by Mottun, is also not available stateside.\n\nDespite it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unfortunate history, harem anime don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to be bad. They can be great, just like any other genre. The difference is that all the good harem titles I can think of were high concept works that used the genre as a backdrop for a clear, ambitious plot that received most of the writer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focus. A few good examples would be Chobits and some versions of Negima. I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put it anywhere near the same playing field as those titles, but for what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth, Nakaimo DID vastly exceed my expectations. Of course, I was expecting it to be a 1/10 piece of filth, so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s admittedly not saying much. It tried, and at the end of the day, that alone made me develop a soft spot for it. There was some genuine effort that went into making this title stand out among it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s genre, and while that effort might have ultimately been bogged down and silenced by the trends and clich\u00c3\u00a9s of the genre, it still makes enough of an impact to show what the genre CAN be. I enjoyed this show, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d watch it again, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d even recommend it to a few people, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be a bad critic if I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t judge it as a whole. I give Nakaimo: My Sister is Among Them a 4/10."}, {"id": 3351, "score": 0, "body": "_\u00e2\u0080\u009cMM-EEEEH EHH EHH MEHHHHH AHH RRRR AHHHHHRHHH AHHHHHHHHASDFGHJKL\u00e2\u0080\u009d_ \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Quote from either a character in the show or myself. It was kind of hard to tell since both of us were in some severe pain and agony at the time.\n\nDragon Ball is one of the most famous and successful franchises in both the manga and anime industries, spawning several stand-alone movies, video games and TV sequels being made to this day. It is practically a household name, a worldwide phenomenon that holds a ton of nostalgia amongst many anime fans, and whatever thoughts you might have about its overall quality, you cannot deny that it is one of the most influential anime that has ever been made. You may be wondering why I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m talking about Dragon Ball at all in this review, but the thing is that it is important to understand that when shows, books or even ideas gain huge success, what follows is usually a bunch of knock-offs and cheap imitations that try to capitalize on the original\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success. Super Kid (titled on MAL as Super Child as this is being written) is a show that many believe to be one of these knock-offs. However, I would go against that belief; not because it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t true, but because just by having Dragon Ball affiliated by name to this travesty is giving it too much acknowledgement. This show needs to be called out for what it really is: One of the absolute worst things that I have ever experienced in my entire life!\n\nTechnically, Super Kid is a cartoon created in South Korea that apparently took 3 years to make before being released upon the masses in 1995 and eventually this abysmal pile of animated horseshit made it to the West and managed to get actual distribution and an English dub (Fuck you Canada). But do not let even that mild achievement fool you, as this is easily a contender for the infamous title of \u00e2\u0080\u009cWorst Anime of All Time\u00e2\u0080\u009d, right down in the depths of anime hell with the likes of Mars of Destruction, Hand Shakers, Pupa and Boku no Pico. While you might find this review enjoyable, the actual show is anything but; it tests the limits of human tolerance to shit, and with a runtime of over 100 minutes, that is a holy load of shit to endure. I remember the first time I ever watched this shitstain and I regret that decision to this very day. I had heard from people like BobSamurai that this was one of the worst anime he had ever seen so I was not going into it with any real expectations. But the expectations I went in with were fucking shattered because it was just THAT FUCKING TERRIBLE! I was a fool for even giving Super Kid a chance, as I was only 20 minutes in before I gave up. I could only take 1/5th of it on my first try, already falling into depression and questioning my life choices. Then later, I tried again and managed to survive the entire ordeal, and now I regret even getting into anime at all. All because I came across this worthless piece of garbage. I was a fool for initially watching the shit, but I must have been mentally retarded or under the influence to give it a second chance and sit through all of it. And even in a world where practically everyone should be allowed second chances, this is a worthy exception to that ideology. And now, here I am, months after enduring the horror that is Super Kid, with a review that aims to not only expose this garbage as one of the worst things to ever have been made, but to also act as a warning to never attempt to watch this shit as no one should be masochistic enough to sit through all this shit and live to tell the tale. Epidemics have been caused by anime much more competent that this, please have mercy on yourself and the rest of mankind.\n\nThe actual movie that is Super Kid starts around 4 minutes in because the first 4 minutes were dedicated to this awkward trailer for the show that acts more like a summary than anything to get viewers interested or engaged. It is just a monotonous, irksome synopsis that tells everyone watching what they are going to witness, only 96 minutes longer. This is a waste of 4 minutes on the production side and it does more to help the safety of the public by letting them see what they are about to experience and providing enough time for people to evacuate the cinemas before it is too late. The narrator comes off as completely obnoxious and overexaggerates the shit out of this show, filled to the brim with blatant lies that no one would buy. Saying that this show has \u00e2\u0080\u009cnonstop action from beginning to end\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cfilled with laughs, thrills and terror\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Unfortunately, it is all just terror, and can only be considered action by default, especially when it is coupled with animation so awful that it is painful to watch and audio that changes volume inconsistently throughout the entire trailer. If anything, this show belongs in the genre of self-torture, because that is all you will get throughout the entire 100+ minute runtime. The narrator also fucks up his own lines, saying that \u00e2\u0080\u009ceach new villain is more dangerous than the next\u00e2\u0080\u009d. You read that right, not as dangerous as the next, or more dangerous as the last, but every new villain is MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE NEXT! Whatever, I should not even be going on about the trailer for this; it is probably the best part of this entire show, and it only goes downhill from here. So, to all the anime fans that decided to ignore my warnings about this shit and plan to continue watching it, this was your chance to stop and do something productive with your time. If you are in this for the long haul, then you, like myself when I first saw this, are a fool. And to quote Mr. T: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI pity the fool!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe movie properly begins with news reporter (spelled \u00e2\u0080\u009cRoperter\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Hell I guess) Ju Eun-Joo sleeping at her desk for the first 2 minutes before waking up and falling out of her chair and onto the ground, before falling back to sleep again. She must have bipolar or some similar disorder to be like this at her workplace and not get punished for it. And yes, this show focused on a minor character sleeping for the first 2 minutes. Eventually she is woken up after her phone becomes animated like an old Disney cartoon, moves right next to her before waking her useless ass up with one of the most obnoxious and painful ringtones I have ever heard in an anime. It was her boss that was calling her, but that does not matter much to her as she literally falls asleep again while on the phone to him. How does she even have a news reporting job in her current state? Anyway, she is informed that a group of kidnappers are fighting the \u00e2\u0080\u009cSuper Kids\u00e2\u0080\u009d and she is to go to their location and report on it. I just have to say it: Ju is obviously supposed to be the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Bulma\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of the series, however she is nowhere near as intelligent, useful or attractive as her counterpart and is more akin to Jabba the Hutt.\n\nIt is at this point where the audience is given a debrief about who the \u00e2\u0080\u009cSuper Kids\u00e2\u0080\u009d are exactly. Ju takes off in her flying car and this is where shit really starts to get bad. First off, Ju\u00e2\u0080\u0099s car changes in interior design as she travels to the Super Kid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s destination, most likely due to the animators not giving a single fuck about the show they are working on to bother remembering what it looks like. Really gives you an impression of how much the staff cared about making this shit. Then, the information about the Super Kids is shown, except you cannot read all of it because not only is half of it spelt incorrectly, but because this movie was recorded off of a handheld camera that cropped out part of the screen! It is also an epic failure when it comes to battles because the camera keeps zooming in and out on scenes where nothing happens and throughout the entire duration would not stop moving the fuck around. Did Korea know that there is something called a fucking tripod? I have never seen such incompetence quite like this. To add more insult to injury, the group is not actually called the Super Kids, but called the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGokdari Group\u00e2\u0080\u009d after the name of group member, Son Goku troll and the main character, Gokdari. What, the fuck?\n\nRegarding the group, from what I can make out of the shoddy information sheets and what is told to us, Gokdari is the leader of the group and is nearly 200 years old. He also possesses superhuman strength and is full of chivalry. That is not much information at all to gain much of an understanding of who Gokdari as a character is, but unfortunately, that is the most we get from every character in the group. Other members include Big Boy, who stands at 170cm, weighs 160kg, is 13 years old and is labelled a coward. That last part is the most honest thing that is said in this entire show considering how much time is spent on Big Boy shivering in battles like a little bitch. We also have the fugliest member of the entire group in Samachi: a 99 year old alien that also happens to be full of chivalry and is said to be a \u00e2\u0080\u009cspace super power\u00e2\u0080\u009d. But the most distinctive feature he has is his appearance; this dude look like the result of King Piccolo banging an asparagus stalk, and bipolar \u00e2\u0080\u009croperter\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ju has the audacity to say that she would be up to dating him. What in the actual fuck!?! I may not know what kind of people live in the world of Super Kid and this might be an attempt to promote a morally good message about beauty on the inside and such, but this show also promotes retardation in every fucking scene. The insect has probably been on drugs the last couple weeks and in the picture provided he physically looks so starved that he would probably rather eat shit for 2 hours than appear in this garbage. In total, there are 8 members that are given a debrief and 2 of them barely get any screen time at all and do not do anything in regards to the plot. As well as this, only 2 of the members are under 18 years old, with the majority of the members being considered well into their adult years, and some being hundreds of years old, yet they are called the \u00e2\u0080\u009cSuper Kids\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Fuck this.\n\nThey finally get to the fight between the kidnappers and the Super Kids, but I use the term fight very loosely here. This has some of the worst choreography, transitions, build-up, subtlety, any element that you could come up with that has an influence on what makes a fight good is done terribly here, and it is not surprising given everything that we have seen so far, you can only realistically expect so much. One part that especially pissed me off in this fight was when Gokdari gets the upper hand and puts his staff in his opponent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth and causes it to lengthen in height, resulting in the kidnapper crying in pain and trying to give up because his jaw would have been ripped apart, but Gokdari did not care at all about that. So much for being full of chivalry, ya dick. What is even more mind-boggling is how the opponent puts the lengthened staff back into his mouth to prove he was trying to give up. Did no one working on this know what a fight actually is? They also try and sneak in a Casablanca reference in the fight scene because why the fuck not? It sure as hell adds nothing to the fight. And to top it off, they use tentacles\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Better get used to them because tentacles are used by every main villain throughout this show and are used a lot. But more on that later. This entire \u00e2\u0080\u009cfight\u00e2\u0080\u009d only proved to me that the staff behind it are incompetent at not only directing a fight scene, but also following basic subplots. The only trait we learned about Gokdari prior to the fight is that he is full of chivalry, and yet here, he is basically torturing his opponents. It gets even worse when after the battle, Gokdari hands over the kidnappers to the police in public, with one of them butt naked, leading to much embarrassment and humiliation from everyone. So much for Gokdari being a chivalrous guy. And of course, he only handed them to the police AFTER he was given the bounty for them. But perhaps the biggest blunder of them all was the fact that despite they were kidnappers, the Super Kids did not give a fuck about who they kidnapped, leaving their current whereabouts and wellbeing completely unknown. And right now, I think that it is important to know that so far this review has only covered the first 20 minutes of the film\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. Fuck this!\n\nAfter that ordeal, the show moves to a couple cops trying to find where the Super Kids are now that the kidnapper have been taken care of, except the flying car that they are in cannot even fly; it teleports several times around the fucking screen. The saddest part about this is the fact that when Ju used a flying car before, it could at least be considered in motion. This is a bunch of still pictures that have no flow or consistency between them. The policemen arrive at the Super Kid tower (an abandoned tower) where before they can even enter the same room as the team, we are shown the team using a hologram and an abacus in the same room. And that abacus is apparently being used to count the reward from the kidnappers: $50 million dollars. The policemen ask the Super Kids to capture this new villain Judowgi, who sold his family to slavery for gold. He also has committed acts of planetary genocide beforehand but that gets shoved under the bus. What is even more insulting is that the reward for Judowgi is $200,000. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forget that the reward for those two kidnappers before was $50 million\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even make this shit up!\n\nNevertheless, the Super Kids accept the task and get in the Gundam rip-off to fly to the planet Judowgi occupies, and this time the animators actually show the robot flying. I would be impressed since the animators do something competently in this film, but it just irritates me how inconsistent the staff is with animating the most basic concepts that is never a problem with any other legitimate anime you can find. I guess that would have drained their already abysmal budget down the drain. Also, every time there is flying in this show, the animators reuse cells at nausea and never even try to hide it. They did not even bother to draw a larger picture to make it less obvious. Super Kid truly is revolutionary in how it is able to fuck up on so many basic levels. While the team is on a supposed 20-day round trip, we find out that not everything is what it seems with the two policemen. One wants the people of a planet to love and respect him to further his political agenda, while the other is revealed to not be human. Startling revelation, except no one watching this could try to give a fuck about what is happening on screen. By the way, that reporter from before managed to sneak into the Gundam and is there too, because reasons! Nothing in this show makes any fucking sense. Heck, when they all finally arrive at their destination, they scout the land on top of a magical flying carpet. If you are still reading this, you should have already started to lose your fucking mind and have a headache so bad you should see a doctor about it. But that pain is only miniscule compared to what the actual show does.\n\nFrom here, we see Gokdari blast the shit out of the planet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s indigenous E.T before the group encounters 3 villains: Judowgi, a red alien and a sorcerer that can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop teleporting. The sorcerer, surprisingly has the best backstory of all three - his son was killed by a police officer and thus helps Judowgi on his quest for world domination. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty shit but at least he has a reason for his actions, as poor as it may be. In this show, you take what you can get. The red alien? That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the officer that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t human. They showed him having a metal arm before but I guess the production team decided later that it would be easier to animate a red monster with tentacles. Judowgi is also a mind fuck given that he fights the Super Kids most of the time in a different form; one that allows for more tentacle action. Other than Judowgi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s battle, the fights are not worth the time and effort to mention honestly. But one thing, never in a fight does anyone dodge an attack. These fights are more turn-based than a Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon game, but at least in some Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon games, dodging is actually an option. \n\nThe thing about Judowgi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fight with the Super Kids is that compared to what we have seen previously, this is some next level bullshit. Judowgi has the team all beat with tentacles only, until he is betrayed by the sorcerer. He was betrayed because the Super Kids reminded him of his son. I want all of you reading this to now look at the cover picture of this crap and see the ugly ass gremlin on the cover. That piece of shit reminded him of his dead son. The sorcerer then caused Judowgi to spit out a dragon ball, weakening him to the point where he uncontrollably changes forms between fugly ass tree and the Elephant Man. Despite being weakened, he still kicks the shit out the Big Boy and meth-head Piccolo, but then we get the biggest asspull so far. Gokdari can use Expansion Jutsu and uses this to take the upper hand before Big Boy channels his inner Yokozuna and hits multiple Banzai Drops to send this motherfucker into the Shadow Realm. Finally, we see the Super Kids back on Planet \u00e2\u0080\u009cFuck Logic\u00e2\u0080\u009d as Gokdari donated the $200,000 reward to a nearby orphanage and everyone lives happily ever after\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 except for those of us unfortunate enough to have seen this schlock.\n\nAnd with that, I am done! There is more bullshit in the show that I could talk about, like how Big Boy is trapped in the friendzone and acts as a third wheel around Ju and itsy bitsy Samachi, or how they rip off even more ideas from pop culture, but since I started writing this review I have lost my mind, turned my brain off, came back to reality before finally no longer giving a fuck about this show. This was god-awful. I have wasted hours of my life watching this bullshit. It is so hard to put into words the exactly quality of this garbage because I have seen abysmal anime before. The anime is noted at the beginning: Mars of Destruction, Pupa, Boku no Pico, all of these are horrendous in their own right, but Super Kid manages to fuck up so much on so many levels that it makes these other shows look competent. The plot. OH. MY. GOD. I cannot find one solid aspect of the story that is worth a shit. NOT ONE! And the thing is that this is such a simple plot, but it is so fucked in the ass with bullshit and nonsense that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like the story was shoved into a shredder and what was left was used by the staff as a public toilet. The characters!? What characters!? Saying it has characters implies that the show had more than one, and there is only one character worth talking about, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the fucking troll doll! Gokdari is probably the worst protagonist that I have ever seen in an anime. They tell you he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a nice guy with good morals and is \u00e2\u0080\u009cfull of chivalry\u00e2\u0080\u009d, but his actions say the complete opposite about him. So much, that you just want to go into your computer screen and choke the life out of him. In fact, they should have renamed him \u00e2\u0080\u009cCockdari\u00e2\u0080\u009d, because that is exactly who he is, a cock-sucking brat. \n\nIf you thought the story and characters are the only problems with Super Kid, you must be blind, deaf and dumb. The animation, just look at the picture on the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s MAL page and you can tell that it looks like shit. I have already talked about the epic failures the animation in this show has, so much so that Super Kid has without question the worst animation that I have ever seen. At least with Hand Shakers, it looks somewhat new and in a way, fits in with the animation of today. This looks like the people behind this worked in the early 80\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, used the DeLorean from Back to the Future to travel over a decade into the future and still thought animation was the same back then. And even back then, it would have looked like shit, but it came out in 1995, the same year as Ghost in the Shell for fuck\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake. And the sound? The sound is probably the best thing about this whole show, but even then, that is no compliment as it still manages to make an epic failure when it comes to sound. Not only is the soundtrack and the voice acting terrible, but the utilization of audio in this film is horrendous. The sound effects don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even match the action happening on the screen and the volume changes so much that it all feels like an assault on your eardrums.\n\nThankfully, you can turn the volume off, but what you should really be doing is turning the entire show off! This is not the kind of show that was released too early in development and needed to be taken back to the drawing board. Superkid is the kind of show that needed to be taken into a dark alley and have its brains blown out. The only thing noteworthy about Super Kid is that every aspect of the show FUCKING SUCKS! It is my personal belief that Super Kid was not made to be an anime. Super Kid was made to be this new torture method made that escaped while still in production and some awful production company called the UM Productions thought they could use this to make money and increase their popularity by releasing it as an anime to the public. All it increased was the rates of suicide and depression of South Korea, and yet somehow Super Kid managed to get an English dub. Well since it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s called an anime to this day, all that I have to say is... THIS IS THE WORST ANIME THAT I HAVE EVER FUCKING SEEN!"}, {"id": 3352, "score": 33, "body": "As a fan of the games, this kind of half-hearted cynical half-baked crap that Hoods presented, appalls me.\n\nGame Anime Adaptations! If you've been hanging around the community for long enough, you may notice a trend. Anime adaptations of video games don't exactly have a good rep (not as bad as movie adaptations to be honest). Sure, some like say, Persona 4 The Animation, do a good job adapting the story and characters, while putting decent production values into the music, acting, and animation, but then we get shows like Blazblue Alter Memory. Shows that botch the story, wreck the characters, and overall, not give enough of a damn to satisfy the fans who clamored for its existence. Let's expand on this one.\n\nIf you know about the games this anime was based on (Blazblue Calamity Trigger, and Blazblue Continuum Shift), then you'd know about the many different paths and endings they have, and with exception to the Calamity Trigger Reconstruction found in an updated version of Continuum Shift known as Continuum Shift Extend, the games challenge you to determine what goes where in order to piece together the true chronology of the games (and feel like a genius in the process). The anime decided to make a lot of changes; none of which are acceptable (with one exception that goes under episode 11 spoilers). The first episode condensed so much, in such choppy and cumbersome fashion, that it almost guarantees fans to be pissed. The first game had enough canon content for approximately 6 episodes,and the second game he even more content, over double that of the former. This adds up to about 20 episodes worth of content to adapt, meaning they could easily separate this into a 6-episode mini-series and a full-cour sequel. \n\nThe first game's storyline is cleared in the first 2 & 1/2 episodes. This meant, rushing a lot of the early parts of that story, along with cutting things out entirely. Then, certain subplots of BOTH GAMES were removed entirely, seeing as they take up to past the third game to resolve. This means, we only have 10 and 1/2 episodes worth of canon material left. So, we got 2 pseudo-filler episodes to permeate what's left of the 12 episode run-time, which automatically damned the story, given how much there was to adapt. Hell, the two pseudo-filler episodes could've spent some time world building like in the games, but I bet Production I.G. was too busy counting all that Psycho Pass money to bother. Then again, they gave this to Hoods, so, whatever. \n\nThis anime is also a terrible place for newcomers since the anime offers too many changes, and it's also marred by awful pacing that makes it actually even harder for anyone to understand than the games, including the fans, and that's just sad. Episodes 1 and 2 are especially guilty of this, with episode 1 speeding through about 4 episodes worth of content, and episode 2 slowing down dramatically compared to the pacing of episode 1, making it feel like the show hit the brakes after realizing how fast it was going. Certain motivations and story elements don't add up, and the changes, most of them range from unnecessary to downright damaging, only compound this issue, along with the issues of the next category. But before we head there, I must also mention that with the amount of stuff they cut out (more than 1/2 of the important subplots) it would be impossible to adapt the third game and make it fit with this anime. They'd have to go the Tokyo Ghoul Root A route of making up new things due to how far gone it was, and given the actual quality of the series, adaptation quality aside, I don't think they could pull that off, in the off chance that they get that sequel after all.\n\nLet's start with the main protagonist, Ragna, as he gets the worst treatment here. In the games, he was a badass/jerkass who always knew what witty insults and rebuttals to come up with. He often was subjected to ridicule among a majority among the other characters, and coupled with his harsh backstory, you couldn't help but feel sorry for the guy, especially since he's actually a pretty great guy if you're not an asshole to him (for most part), well, gruesome 1-man rebellion aside. Here, if you know the personality of New Dante/Donte (BrainScrachComms reference)/Dante from DMC Devil May Cry, you can see where the anime screwed Ragna up. His development is confusing and nonsensical, he is somewhat less sharp with the tongue, yet much more of a prick, and not likable here at all, even with the backstory, well except for episode 8. Most of the others have major flaws I won't even begin to point out, lest this review become insanely tedious to make. A lot of them are also either watered down, missing distinct personality traits from the games, or given new traits that either clash with the characters, or just come off as jarring like most characters, Makoto Nanaya, and Imperator Librarius respectively.. Only a few characters suffered little damage, and the only improved character from the source material is Lambda-11, given how little screen time she had.\n\nThe production values aren't much better. The object models (most of them anyway) look on par with some anime around 2013, but that's the only praise this'll get. The character models look more generic and odd, almost annoying, especially since they are rife with animation mistakes, and you will most certainly notice them and how awful hey are. Unfortunately, there are a wild amount of lip-synching problems (in the SUB no less in 2013 where studios have normally fixed that issue to a decent extent) which bog down the animation front, and given a 12 episode series done in 2013, this is inexcusable. The fights are horrendous as well. Sure some of the later ones are borderline passable albeit still very generic, but the first and last 2 battles are all dreadful, suffering from terrible choreography, random ass mini explosions due to regular poles and swords tapping the ground (no extra supernatural or sci-fi stuff to them, just plain ol'  swords and poles being swung),  attacks that don't behave like in the game, and random likes drawn whenever characters battle in a top down perspective, despite the fact that nothing is flashing! Just... DBZ spam (minus flashy attacks and blasts) that way they don't have to animate good fight scenes. This proves that this doesn't just fail as an adaptation, it fails as an action show in general. How sad that the animated cutscenes for the third game Blazblue Chronophantasma (which came out mere months before this garbage did). I get that Hoods was the one responsible for this show, but goddamn, at least TRY to make your characters look good!\n\nSo, as established, this show is a dumpster fire. Yet, for all my bitching about this series, at least the music staff realized how important this project was. Not only did we get great remixes of the original tracks, but they even cover different music genres! Hell, since certain characters and confrontations only got their own theme in the third game (which came out only a few months before the anime did), those themes were incorporated to the great library of music in this anime. Plus, the OP and ED were both great; just what we'd expect from this franchise. The dub, while not as good as any of the games, it's still pretty decent. Sure some characters like Nu-13 and Taokaka went in less than stellar directions, but the ADR Director, Patrick Seitz, who voices Ragna no less, managed to at least salvage some of the dialogue. Some of the other performances were also pretty good as well, even if not all characters were given the same good direction as in the games, despite having the same voice actors as the third game, which also got dubbed before this. Plus, this anime's awful adaptation of the character designs doesn't really let them lend well towards English voices. Well, the sound`s good, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something I suppose.\n\nDespite the great music and decent dub, I still heavily disliked this anime, to put it lightly. The 1st and 11th episodes pissed me off to Haruhi Season 2 levels, and most of the episodes, barring episode 8, weren't very entertaining either. The horrid fights don't help much either. It was a borderline depressing experience of pain and fury, and barring one episode, each episode made me feel that way, and boy do I never wanna come back.\n\nAll in all, this was a horrendous series that exemplified most of what a bad video game adaptation is. The fights sucked thanks to abysmal choreography and choices, the characters sucked due to being generic in this version, the story sucked for a variety of reasons, and overall, was a very intolerable experience, even with the small flashes of actual quality here and there. In fact, it feels like Hoods either or little effort or simply did not know how to do this at all and just have yo whole throwing shut st the screen, even gutting its source in the process. It feels heartless and soulless. Newcomers should stay away, at least until playing the games, since this did not show off how an anime version of Blazblue would truly be like, let alone what an action series should be like thanks to its abysmal production values and lack of regard to literally anything other than a decent OST. Well, hopefully, whenever the final game comes out, someone can adapt this series properly. Until then, we have some games to play. With that, I bid you adieu."}, {"id": 3353, "score": 2, "body": "\"Now you will experience true evil...\"-Some shitty ass tentacle alien monster, 1995\n\nOh, believe me. I already have. This shit has pushed me to the limit...\n\n*spoilers for Super Kid. Don't watch this fucking abomination; it's not worth your time. Read the review instead and spare yourself the pain*\n\nSuper Kid is some kind of South Korean knockoff of the ultra popular anime: Dragon Ball Z. This anime is so bad that I actually wish I picked Dragon Ball Evolution instead. This pile of fucking horseshit is why I wish we sided with North Korea instead, so the they couldn't make this dumpster fire. In the span of two hours, your patience and sanity is assaulted, put to the test; only the strongest of individuals will survive this travesty. It isn't even funny bad in any regard; it's just maddening. I legitimately find this to be a prime contender for the title of \"Worst Anime of All Time\", and in a world such as this, where over 2 decades after this dreck came out, the likes of Hand Shakers, Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei, and Mars of Destruction exist, that's quite an honor, if you wanna put it that way. You need an iron will to even last halfway through this heap, much less the whole 100+ minute torture session. I might as well have watched SAW; at least there I would know what I'm truly in for before I even watch it. Hell, given that this is a garbage DBZ knockoff, I probably should've watched Dragon Ball Evolution instead.\n\nBefore we even start the putrid excuse for a \"story\", we have to sit through almost 4 minutes of a trailer that shows almost everything that will happen in the movie. It's just an obnoxious and tedious recap of what we were literally about to see and it just kept dragging on and on just as soon as you think it would end. Keep in mind, after this, we have over 100 minutes left to view, and they literally waste our time for 4 whole minutes. Nonetheless, with that out the way, let's jump into the movie proper.\n\nWe actually begin with 2 minutes of Eunjoo sleeping and her coworkers chatting, and the snoring is obnoxious, but then her walkie-talkie goes all Walt Disney on her by sprouting arms, legs, and an angry 1940's Disney cartoon character face before waking her up with an excruciating ringtone that probably hurts us more than it does her. It's a call from the boss of her reporting business and she literally falls asleep again, snoring, and somehow the boss can't hear her loud ass snoring. How has she not been fired yet if she has been doing this kind of crap on a possible consistent basis? Whatever, we see some random, unexplained, green cubes of letters as Eunjoo takes off in her flying car and is given a debriefing on the \"Super kids\u00e2\u0080\u009d, which is just crappy exposition for the audience. Also, the youngest member is 11, the youngest member to be active in the movie is 13, and everyone else is either older or infinitely older, with our protagonist being 199 years old and one of them being 2000 (though they can't identify an exact age but never even try an approximation). Kids my ass.\n\nWe then see these...\"kids\" take on a reject member of the family of Kang and Kodos from the Simpsons, and some Terminator reject, as they have kidnapped a scientist. We never see the scientist in this movie, so this was unnecessary as they could've just made it so that the criminals were causing havoc in the city or something (that way it would make sense how they handled it). After embarrassing interplay and fighting, they are apprehended. Also, we learn that we will never know how these characters get their powers as they just pull any and all powers out of their ass. Remember in Dragon Ball Z, Naruto, or even Fairy Tail how people would call out their attacks and perform specific motions in order to channel their body to perform them? Yeah, there's a reason that's important (as annoying as it can be to hear the same attack name shouted over and over); it's so that it doesn't just come out of thin air. These shounen series actually establish these attacks and what is supposed to happen for them to be executed like a hand sign or a specific body gesture. Here, these guys pull whatever our of their asses, some of which could've really gotten them out of sticky situations had they used them earlier, which becomes especially apparent in the second half.\n\nAfter that, we see the heroes acting like brats before a commissioner and an officer give them their next mission, which is the bulk of the plot: stop this alien overlord which has ravaged planets (you're already making the Frieza and Buu connections, I just know it) and his assistant with a \"tragic past\". After it all goes wrong, said assistant, whose name isn't even on MAL, does a pathetic face turn and points out Heroes to the fact that the officer was evil all along, so they split up, two to take down the cop, and two to take down our main villain, especially since he has recently captured Eunjoo, who was a stowaway since she wanted to get more scoops about them.\n\nThe fight Gokdari and his rock buddy have against the cop who randomly turns into an alien is part for the course at this point, and runners the question of how they got back if tee spaceship they used to get to the alien planet isn't being used; this also applies to how they get back. As for the final fight, it's also par for the pathetic course at this point. The assistant takes it some kind of crazy energy ball the villain stores in him that made him powerful and performs a sacrifice to destroy it, and then the villain gets his ass kicked and arrested, and the heroes get money and spend it on some random charity. The end. Also, remember the 11-year-old girl who was shown in a screen in the beginning? Never shown. There was this guy that looked like Yamaha from the original Dragon Ball and he's only on one scene. Either way, you get my point, right. Everything is pulled out of its ass and never properly introduced and the plot makes no sense. It's such a simple plot, which makes it all the more unbelievable as to how badly they fucked this up. Either way, moving on.\n\nThe team of \"Super Kids\" is absolutely unlikeable and unworthy of being called heroes, the supporting cast is barely there and barely worth mentioning like the lazy and pathetic Bulma wannabe, Eunjoo, and the villains are pathetic and one Note losers that all become crybabies at one point or another. Gokdari is infuriatingly arrogant and dumb, and he actively goes as far as to basically torture opponents who surrender, like that alien. I needn't mention the assistant character with the \"tragic past\" of losing his son and then turning evil until only now decided \"I wanna be good again so I'll help these good guys\". Let's get the rest of this shit show of a cast started since I already covered Eunjoo and Gokdari. Also, the Yamchalookalike and the 11-year-old girl, as well as the generic mayor and the rest of the villains won't get a mention since I have literally already said everything you can say about them in this review as it is; they're that pathetically characterized. There's also this pilot guy who only shows up to do one thing: deliver a punch with his mech to the final boss, leave, and then go weirdly berserk in hopes of finding the now defeated villain. Well, here we go...\n\nBig Boy (what a generic and lame name) is a 13-year-old coward who keeps getting the hots for Eunjoo and being an arrogant loser; that's his whole character. Samachi, who looks like a winged and anorexic King Piccolo, is just a bickering teammate who just gets his job done. Rockpile only talks when he wants to make rock puns about something going on and has nothing else to him. Saint Teolteol is just an old man with nothing to him other than the fact that he is the eldest one; he doesn't even do anything. You know, the sad truth is that I've just covered every single character here to a T. Pathetic.\n\nI bet that as soon as you heard \"Korean knockoff\", you immediately knew that the animation would be cheap at best; you'd be right since sometimes you actually do have to judge a book by its cover. The animation often jitters to the point of looking like an animatic (or a series of still pictures moving fast but not fast enough to convince us of actual motion); this is a 1995 movie, a movie released the same year as Ghost in the Shell and Macross Plus Movie Edition, with both are gorgeously animated. The fight scenes are pretty bad as well thanks to the lack of actual choreography. Characters almost never dodge either. Expect a distressing amount of reused animation, which I have never seen in an animated film before. Then again, this was probably made in a puny budget; that would explain why they hired a Horrendous cameraman to record this. They often zoom in and out for no reason and in many scenes of travel, the camera just jitters in order to help make the scene look less like animation and more like an animatic. It's not like it records the full screen either given how during the scene where Eunjoo sees bios of the Super Kids, it's cut off. The animation isn't overall abysmal, but it's still terrible and coupled with it being reused and having a bad camera, yeah...\n\nEver wanted to see a film assault your ears? Then you've come to the right place, fucko! This film will make your ears bleed in pain and beg for mercy by the 10-minute mark. The OST is obnoxious as fuck, and that's largely thanks to the fact that the sound equipment in this film is so goddamn awful that a 1960's Hanna Barbera cartoon does a better job, no scratch that, fucking 1920's films have infinitely better sound equipment for their music and voice acting! Then again, the OST is worthless even on its own and I don't need to research the songs to tell you that. The sound effects are beyond atrociously as well, like the rocks or how when a character crashes into a ground it at one point has the sound effect of the classic \"character gets slammed into a car\", and I don't need to tell you why that is a horrible sound effect choice, do I? It applies to almost every single sound effect imaginable here. The Ocean Dub (yeah, it was dubbed by the people that gave you the god-awful DBZ Ocean dub) is easily the worst dub I have ever heard in my life, not because the voices don't remotely fit with the characters, but because they're so damn grating! Special mention goes out to the infuriating voice of Gokdari and the borderline incomprehensible voices of the cop's alien form and the main villain's final form! God, fuck this dub! Fuck everything about the audio! I'm damn sure I lost at least a few cilia over this horse shit! Let's just move on...\n\nThis film is so, so goddamn irritating that it hurts! Hurts like a mother fucker! If the abominable characters don't piss you off enough, the nightmarish audio will really crest an experience so irritating that it becomes even more maddening than having to put up with a whining, crying 2 year old at the supermarket that just wants whatever the fuck he can't have, and having to put up with that is not only infuriating (especially if you're the parent), but it's goddamn mortifying for all parties involved. Yet, this film is more irritating and more mortifying; I'd be less embarrassed getting caught watching hentai than even watching this shit, let alone getting caught doing so, especially since it's basically self-inflicted torture for me to view this; I'd get sent to a mental hospital. It's maddening, but not infuriating to the point where you just want to explode like the absolute worst title I've covered, though believe me, with the audio, it really comes close. It's just overwhelming enough to push you to the brink of your endurance but not destructive enough to the point of blind rage and a passionate lust for revenge, and that makes it all the more painful since I cannot reasonably vent until after the viewing is over rather than if I exploded while watching as that means I get to blow off steam to the very piece of technology that is broadcasting what I'm watching. I nearly gave up 15 minutes in, to put that into perspective, and if it was a full-blown television series with 12, 24, or more episodes, I certainly would have.\n\nNow, is Super Kid the worst anime I've seen? God no! Unlike what I consider to be the worst, it doesn't have a gigantic and brutal concentration of plot holes and abandonments of its premise, contradictions of its own logic, or abominable characters with absurd motivations and actions, nor is this as visually offensive. However, it is one of, if not the most irritating and audibly offensive piece of work I have ever endured. Its characters are shallow and pathetic, it pulls so many things out of its ass, it's world building is also ass, its animation is cheap and lazy, and its audio is irreparably bad in terms of equipment, music, sound effects, and dub. It may not be the worst anime I've ever seen, but it's easily in the top 3, as well as being the current worst movie I've ever seen by a wide margin. Fuck this movie and everything about it, not just as a DBZ fan, but a fan of anime, animation, action, and storytelling. With all that said, I'm off to watch some Dragon Ball Z Abridged. "}, {"id": 3354, "score": 3, "body": "You know, when the main Japanese demographic your anime markets towards ends up hating your anime, then you know it blows chunks. Not even pretty girls can remedy that fact. I should\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve listened to OtaKing. Well, rationality is incomprehensible to anyone involved with this show's existence. If you don't want to see a rant on this crappy piece of work that is the cheap bootleg equivalent to Konosuba and an insult to harems, isekai, and entertainment, leave immediately. The gloves come off and the spell of death is cast.\n\nCreative bankruptcy. It's something that any artist of any medium worth his or her salt should dread when creating a work. It's when the art has no soul of any kind, no artistic purpose behind it, meant only for the money. That brings us to our target: Isekai wa Smartphone. This pile of insufferable, bland, incompetent dreck can fuck off for giving harem and isekai shows a bad name (more so than they already have), and for not caring about being a show for people to watch. It has no soul, no drive, and is just an example of corporate greed and a lack of care by literally everyone involved in every aspect of production, outside of the voice actors. It is the antithesis of spellbinding, as it half-heartedly casts the spell of boredom and hatred.\n\nThis anime can't establish anything properly. It can't establish magic until way after it was used and even then the system, especially concerning null, is stupid. It doesn't establish the idea of guilds properly at all. The gauntlets, the currency, none of it! Part of it is because its worldbuilding is beyond atrocious, and there are gigantic leaps and lies, so yeah. Oh, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an example! When a butler got hit with an arrow offscreen, how? Apparently he and the guys he was with were surrounded by lizards with swords and shields, so that can't work, and apparently part of it broke off and... yeah. Also, inconsistent magic since they say the only way to use magic (except maybe null) was with special designated crystals yet they violate that multiple times. Oh, and the protagonist knows literally every magic ever, including the personal null ones, which are already a bad system due to being contradictory (since they're supposed to be unique but they're recorded in ways that imply more people can use these null spells, but they're each limited to a few people at a time), and heck, the magic system as a while had its own tuned violated constantly with people constantly using elemental magic without a magical fragment catalyst, so fuck this anime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own rules, amirite?! Oh, and they just randomly and haphazardly insert us into a bunch of scenarios for the characters to quickly solve and have no remote emotional effect on the audience or even have any meaningful things for the characters aside from them interacting and constantly blushing. God, this piece.\n\nDo I even need to mention that this is a generic piece of work with so many of the worst clich\u00c3\u00a9s of a typical LN and that it has some of the worst variations on them I have ever seen? Do I need to mention that this is basically an off-brand of Konosuba that actually went beyond an expiration date before airing? No? Well, too bad! What about the setting and story beats? Well, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something interesting: we don't know how MC-kun died! Think back to any Isekai you've seen. Re:Zero? Subaru blinked and somehow fake into a fantasy world, unsure how it happened but he was summoned by Satela. Knight's & Magic? Kurata (who we know as Ernesti in the fantasy world) got ran over, though we don't know how he got to his fantasy world. Konosuba? Kazuma died of shock and tricked a stupid cunt \u00e2\u0080\u009cgoddess\u00e2\u0080\u009d into coming with him into a fantasy world. Here, well, God tells him that he was stuck by a bolt and then is willing to send him somewhere, we don't actually see what happened to him. It wouldn't have taken long to do something so basic, but look at what I'm reviewing. It can't have a good sweet moment either since it ruins those, even though they don't even work in the first place, but way to ruin your theoretical chance, anime! Oh, and pacing is fucked with this one, especially in the first half. I know I'm just sort of ranting and raving but damn, my brain is trying to scrape this show off of it and none of my friends want to kill this anime, so I have to now. This show has no effort put into anything at all; why should I bother? I would say because I care and because I try to put effort by honestly, my brain is committing genocide against any specifics I can bring up about this nightmare of a show.\n\nI don't think this anime had heard of this term I'm about to say: it's called \u00e2\u0080\u009ccharacterization\u00e2\u0080\u009d! No character has a real defined personality, especially not the main character, who at best can be defined as the stereotypical boring and weak yet OP AF protagonist, like Ayato from The Asterisk War. By far this show's most disturbing and avant-garde offense is that I actually believe that all of the main women in the show are largely the exact same character with the most minor of different traits. No show to my knowledge has ever done that before. Obviously, these bitches are all trash, especially the tsundere one for being a typical tsundere. I can't remember any real traits from anyone else for this show has staged a coup on my brain!\n\nThe other characters are bland and without personality and do stuff you expect, so that leaves us with MC-kun. Oh wait, I said everything about him other than the fact they he gets so OP without any actual progression that it constantly feels like he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pulling powers out of his ass, and yes, he does get a harem, to the point where all of the members can even travel with him, it's their crowded a harem, and for next to no reason beyond \u00e2\u0080\u009cDude is nice enough to help and can do crazy things\u00e2\u0080\u009d and not due to anything about his personality or even looks... ugh. His name is Touya, and I learned that over time but it's obviously not worth remembering. Actually, why should you remember a single character's name? Aside from weakling OP MC-kun, I certainly don't! There is nothing standout or remotely interesting about any of them. They also constantly blush and get embarrassed for no adequate reason. They're also all idiots as displayed by the crime-solving scene in episode 4. I only remember something about the blonde 12 year old princess and it's that she acts like a 6 year old half the time. Just...wow. I could go on and on about the character and especially the narrative problems, but honestly, this anime tries so little in any department that it's honestly not worth it.\n\nVeteran studio, Production Reed took the reigns for this and boy did they not do a good job, to put it lightly. The character art and overall animation are both so unbelievably flat, and so is the magic. It's not a pleasant view at any point, it all looks insanely plain, life-draining in fact! The character designs are pretty terrible overall, to add insult to injury. They can even get walking right as it looks like they're often moving both forward and backward in some walking scenes, like the beginning of episode 3. In fact, they always mess it up somehow, and it's just walking! How?! Why?! Oh, and when you see debris in a fight scene, it looks so poorly drawn and it doesn't fit well with any of the rest of the art at all. \n\nDon't expect much animation in the fight scenes either, especially in the episode 7 duel with the awful looking wooden swords; and I thought Akashic Records was bad in that department. You can also see some rather noticeable errors here, like faces being off, the fact that one of the characters who has a sword suddenly had two swords with hilts on her sleeve and not her waist, and yeah, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty bad and lazy. They also use a lot of visual gag shortcuts that I thought only long-running shounens were allowed to get away with (since no other kind of show uses them and those shows have an insane amount of episodes to have to spread their budget and staff and time etc. on). It's a visual bore with blunders, though thankfully there really isn't any CGI to speak of, since I'm sure that probably would've been handled poorly, just like every there aspect of this show. You know, except it contains some atrocious CGI stairs that have a gigantic frame rate drop and get repeated verbatim later on with a different color and some abysmal fire effects that last for a while in episode 5! You know, because this anime also has to compete for the worst visuals of 2017 too!\n\nThe main uniform the girls wear looks awful, especially with those lines in the white part. One of the character designs is blatantly ripped from the princess from Knight's & Magic, whose anime adaptation just so happens to be airing at the same time as this, only she has been aged down by comparison to a 12-year-old. Why are we sexualizing 12-year-olds again? Also, expect some shitty digital close-ups. Lastly, for God knows what reason, they have it so that the eyebrows and eyelashes always overlap with the hair rather than being obstructed by it. This is basic anime shit and they constantly mess that up. Then again, they didn't really try here either, did they? Oh, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fair amount of reused animation, so that's a sin, especially since unlike Knight's & Magic, this isn't a mecha show (not that I really excuse that show for it either). C\u00e2\u0080\u0099mon, it's 2017! This shit shouldn't be happening anymore! And.. .that's everything for this one. Sadly, this is somehow the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best, or rather, its least worst aspect, it only barely.\n\nFor what it's worth, the OST on its own isn't actually that abysmal, though some tracks are especially bad and wrong. Sure, none of it works or can even be considered memorable, but what's worse is the fact that almost none of it ever fits with the scenes at all. Oh, and while I'll talk about those cancerous scene transitions a bit later and how pointless and aggravating they are in every way possible, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just say that the music makes matters worse in those moments. The OP is the most obnoxious and generic JPop song I have ever heard in my life, especially the techno aspects. Fuck this song, it's not worth naming since it's one of the worst OP songs I have ever heard. Same applies to the ED to a slightly lesser extent; it's also awful and I don't care which of the characters sings it. There is nothing of merit to the music in this show whatsoever, and that almost never happens. If that isn't sad, I don't know what is.\n\nYou know, I have to ask: for those out there who actually enjoyed this anime, how? What is the appeal of this? Is it the fact that the main character is OP? Is it the fact that this is a world with magic? Is it the admittedly out there premise? Because... I don't see this as a show that really wants to entertain, like at all. I see no semblance of soul from this anime, no spirit or any enthusiasm from it or anything. It's not even just super bland to the point of feeling like it was meant for passive entertainment like some other perfunctory works out there. It's not like it even really attempts to have interesting, consistent, or involved fight scenes either. At best, it tries to pander with the whole slime nonsense, in ways that should probably be seen as an insult to the intelligence, or at the very least, ways that should be met with shrugs and groans. And as for the OP MC part, why? Isn't it boring to see some guy plow through anything, especially if he doesn't really do anything fancy or especially crazy and flashy, or have any personality to latch into while doing it? Wouldn't you want that kind of MC to have some actual personality or actually show off some crazy epic shit to cheese fights instead of cheering fights without any effort? Wouldn't you want someone like Izayoi from Problem Children over this main character? \n\nSo it has come to this: the transitions! Fuck these things! They are nothing but obnoxious time-wasters with blaring and equally obnoxious music, either showing the results of a scene for 5 seconds or what happened already, with these stupid and obnoxious characters and voices doing stupid and aggravating things! You see anywhere from 6-8 of these an episode too! You can no doubt tell this got irritating fast! Why was this included? Why?! For comedy? I doubt it succeeded with many viewers.\n\nSo, yeah, this show was boring and vexing as all hell. Not a single moment to enjoy. It doesn't even try so of course I feel unamused to the nth degree. Not to mention that there were a few specific moments (boob grab scene in episode 9 being chief among them) that were especially maddening, so that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help one bit. Some of you might say \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy not just turn your brain off and enjoy the ride?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Because it's so fucking boring and stupid, that's why! If I didn't keep my brain permanently on thinking mode when watching anime, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have dropped so many more by now since I would've quit the moment I got really angry bored from watching, hence more of my time would've been wasted! I actually heard people say this was a parody of these kinds of shows: it is not. It image then completely straight and pretends to be mildly self-aware, so that blows. So yeah, this show fails on both levels! Fuck this show, I hate it! I hate it so much!\n\nThis might prime some of you to ask: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy did you watch this obviously bad show in the first place?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Well, some people probably watched it out of interest of the admittedly out there premise. Maybe some wanted a trashy anime to chill to (and likely found themselves still disappointed). And of course, some of us came here just to join hands with a chunk of the community always ready to see a truly and obviously terrible burn and revel in the flames together (I mean, usually the anime suffering that fate deserves it), often coming one by one to see if it is as bad as the reputation hypes it up to be. Not gonna lie, that was part of it for me. The other part was that for all intents and purposes, this did catch my eye as something I thought would just be a below-average at best isekai title for me to watch and feel little towards, at least after I was initially put off by the cover picture. However, I can definitely say that it did deserve the fate I mentioned in the third reason because as I have been saying over and over again, this anime is the very definition of laziness when it comes to this medium.\n\nAnime is a very intensive and passion-filled medium. There are so many titles out there, good and bad, that obviously show a ton of passion and effort in at least some regard. So, when I see an anime as lazy as this get a sizeable viewership while better and more passionate (if not always good) shows like Knight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s & Magic, ACCA 13, and so on and so forth get at best a much lower viewership and at worst the absolute shaft, I get royally angry. People had to slave over this, and no passion feels like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming out, no care put into anything regarding this show. I am so thankful that this show is getting quite a thrashing, and honestly, it needs all the hate it can get. Honestly, unless you really want to watch something without a soul, you should avoid this anime entirely, as this anime is an affront to the medium as a whole. Is it the absolute worst anime out there? No, there are some worse ones out there for their own reasons, but this anime really has no right to exist, and honestly, it is still very, very high up there, both in an all-time perspective and in the perspective of this season alone. It manages to be an affront to the concept of entertainment, on top of the concepts of a harem and isekai show."}, {"id": 3355, "score": 30, "body": "It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a tale stretching back through countless generations of Japanese mythology\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The legend of Shitenno, the Four Heavenly Kings of Buddhism. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the dragon of the east, the bird of the south, the tiger of the west, and the turtle of the north. By placing statues or other representations of those four animals at the four different points that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re associated with, you can bring good fortune to your home\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Or even to an entire town. One such location is the Abenobashi Shopping Arcade, a long-lasting and culturally rich town that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s finally teetering on the edge of relevence, and drawing nearer to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s end, to the great dismay of Arumi Asahina and Satoshi \u00e2\u0080\u009cSasshi\u00e2\u0080\u009d Imamiya.\n\nHaving spent the first twelve years of their lives in Abenobashi, these two best friends are about to enter a world of uncertainty as the town they love is slowly being destroyed and redeveloped, and Asumi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family is preparing to move to Hokkaido\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But before any of these changes can take place, Asumi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grandfather takes a horrifying fall off the roof of her family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s restaurant. He survives, but their statue of the pelican\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The last remaining guardian statue in the entire town\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Does not. As it shatters, so does reality, thrusting Arumi and Sasshi into a bizarre multi-verse from which there appears to be no escape. They may not ever get back home, but does it matter? I mean, after all, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being human and having your health that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the important part.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said before that the best word you can possibly use to describe the animation quality of any Gainax anime with would be \u00e2\u0080\u009cInconsistent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Well, do you want to know how to make it even more inconsistent? Hire Studio Madhouse to pitch in, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how! Now Madhouse isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily a bad animation company\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I personally feel they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done more good looking shows than bad ones, and hey, every company releases more cheap looking titles than you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d want them to\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But the styles of the two companies are starkly different. Madhouse is primarily known for it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s realism in terms of facial details, shading and environments, even in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more cartoony projects. Gainax, ironically, is much more like an actual mad house in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visual style. Gainax is much more known for it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fast, frenetic character movements and experimental artistic visions. To put it another way, when Gainax tries to put out a show that looks more like a Madhouse project, we get Corpse Princess, and we get bored out of our skulls.\n\nIf there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one thing that both studios excel at, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the clever use of lighting and framing techniques, and Abenobashi looks it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exploiting this similarity. This happens mostly during the slower, more serious scenes, like pretty much the entire first episode. As for the rest of it, this series just looks ghastly. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m assuming there were some major budget problems here, because whether they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re resorting to low frame rates and broken character models to keep the movement flowing or not, it just looks cheap as all hell. It hits rock bottom in the Dating Sim episode, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a very far drop from the episodes that are surrounding it. It looks passable when there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a whole lot of movement going on, but even then, the little movement we do get can sometimes look almost like the result of a poorly drawn flip book. The CGI that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s used whenever Sashi and Arumi jump between worlds is at least pretty impressive.\n\nAs for the soundtrack\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a really weird one. There are a lot of different musical styles in it, all of which were composed by the legendary Evangelion composer, Shiro Sagisu. He has his own aesthetic, but with a story that involves multiverses, and each one of them parodying a different genre, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d also have to pull off a lot of diversity in the sound\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And he does. The soundtrack does it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job nicely. For episodes taking place in present day Abenobashi, he sticks to upbeat, jazzy banjo music, a juxtaposition that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s somehow perfectly fitting with the \u00e2\u0080\u009csouthern hick\u00e2\u0080\u009d reputation that the Osaka region has adopted with the rest of Japan. He abandons this sound and works under a different style for each weird world that the story crosses into, from fantasy epic to big band Star Wars-like themes. It does it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job, but while there are a few stand-out tracks\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The tense, sleazy \u00e2\u0080\u009cHard boiled\u00e2\u0080\u009d BGM from the film-noir episode is a personal favorite of mine\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It still amounts to some generic background music.\n\nThe opening theme, Treat or Goblins, is much less forgettable. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a catchy pop tune with some jazzy orchestration, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sung by Gainax staple Megumi Hayashibara. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fun song, played over clips taken directly from the show(an admittedly lazy tactic), but once you get past the actual music, this song has some strange, strange lyrics. I mean, even for an anime theme. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so hot about an equalitarian, or why I should chit-chat with one, but Hayashibara-sama sure sounds enthusiastic about it. I like the ending theme better, myself.\n\nThe English dub, much like the music, does it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job well enough. The leads are played by Luci Christian and Jessica Boone, two of my favorite actors from classic ADV, and this is one of the first dubs either of them did. Jessica Boone is endlessly charming as mature, ambitious Arumi, but Luci Christian blows away the part of Sasshi, pulling off so much range even as she rasps her voice to what has to be an uncomfortable degree. They work off of each other fluidly, matching and in some cases even surpassing the chemistry the original japanese seiyuu had.\n\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little controversy as to their accents, however. Anime dubs have had a long tradition of representing the Osaka dialect as a southern drawl. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m normally very forgiving about this, as that dialect can be a very difficult thing for an American to pull off. It was used for some comedic effect in Excel Saga, and the dubbed Wolfwood from Trigun was able to use it as smoothly as if the actor were born speaking it, but aside from that, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever heard it done well. The southern accent isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the worst way to represent an Osaka dialect, as any viewers of Azumanga Daioh will tell you, but the fact that the two of them are the only characters in the show speaking it can be a little jarring. In any case, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fine dub overall, but the sub is still a lot more fun. You can go either way on this one.\n\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve watched a lot of Gainax\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work, you may have noticed two themes that they just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop repeating\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The first theme is the perils of growing up, and the second is the dissolution of traditional Japanese culture at the hands of invasive Western influence. These may seem like two distinctly different ideas, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re both representative of the fear and uncertainty of change. You may not find them in every Gainax work, but the amount that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in is staggering. They love writing stories about young children who are either on the verge of puberty or who are already coming of age, and they never shy away from the awkwardness and sexual tension that these changes bring.\n\nIn Abenobashi, Sasshi is our main protagonist(Because of course he is), and these two themes embody everything he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going through in the story. His best friend is moving away just as he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reaching the age where he might start to understand his feelings for her, and his entire neighborhood is quickly being bulldozed to make way for more modern accommodations. We find out pretty quickly that the worlds they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re being sent to aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just a random multiverse, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re his childish fantasies brought to life. Every time they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re about to jump, as Arumi assures him that everything\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be okay when they go home, it just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough for him, and another bizarre world awaits them on the horizon.\n\nThis, alone, is a pretty good concept. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interesting, to say the least, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really the only reason we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re given to care about the two main protagonists. But as the plot evolves, and we get to look deeper and deeper into the backstory of this multi-verse, you can start to see why so many people consider it to be the \u00e2\u0080\u0098boring\u00e2\u0080\u0099 material. It gets way too complicated way too fast, and part of it has to do with just how culturally impenetrable the backstory is. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have to possess a deep understanding of Eastern mythology to fully understand it, and most viewers don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Including me. It involves a story that I can swear I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in later shows like Hell Girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cPurgatory girl\u00e2\u0080\u009d episode, which is really my only clue as to it being a mythology-based story, and the way it ties into the final resolution is just too damn confusing.\n\nOf course, as most fans of the show will tell you, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the story or plot that matters\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the insane, balls-to-the-wall, joke-a-minute genre parody episodes. A little over half of Abenobashi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s episode count is spent on the various worlds that Sasshi chooses for the two of them to visit. Each of these worlds is a macrocosm of the cliches, trends, and tropes of a particular genre of entertainment. It has an experimental feel to it, which brings up Gainax\u00e2\u0080\u0099s third repetitive theme\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The fact that they really, really wish they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been the ones to make Excel Saga.\n\nWell, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never been shy about being the lone dissenting voice, and in my opinion, those are the ACTUAL boring episodes. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not so much \u00e2\u0080\u0098joke-a-minute\u00e2\u0080\u0099 as they are \u00e2\u0080\u0098reference-a-minute,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and considering how little thought or insight go into these references, I found myself constantly referring to Abenobashi as \u00e2\u0080\u009cBuzzfeed the anime.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Every single one of these episodes could have been easily retitled with Buzzfeed-friendly headlines, like \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a sci-fi fan if,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cFans of dinosaurs will roar over these gifs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you hate harems shows and dating games, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll love these observations!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAbenobashi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s style of comedy gets points for pacing, but it absolutely reeks of excess, with constant references being thrown in your face from both sides of the ocean, as well as fan-service shot after fan-service shot that are delivered not only from the kids themselves(ick), but also from the voluptuous, scantily clad meganeko girl \u00e2\u0080\u009cMune-Mune,\u00e2\u0080\u009d their guide to these crazy worlds as she searches for the mysterious blue-haired man that they keep running into. The comedy at play here is more exhausting than funny, and the few jokes I did laugh at were instantly killed by writers who just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to know when enough is enough.\n\nBut getting back to the plot for a moment, we find out halfway through the series that Sasshi isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just jumping between worlds for the reason that he initially thought. The truth is, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s refusing to go back to the real world because of a tragedy that his jumping prevented from happening. I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give away what it was, but the way it was executed was pretty damn clever(Props to you if you figured it out early), and it plays to the fear of death just as well as the world jumping plays to the idea of Sasshi retreating into fantasy in order to avoid the inevitability of change in the world around him. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pretty poignant little twist. The problem, however, is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stupid. Any viewer of at least average intelligence will come up with about half a dozen solutions to this problem, the easiest of which being \u00e2\u0080\u009cGo back to your world just before the tragedy happens, and put yourselves in the right place to manually prevent it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe solution they reach\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 After several episodes of the viewer screaming \u00e2\u0080\u009cFucking tell her already!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 ties in directly to the very culturally impenetrable sub-plot that I was talking about earlier, leaving many viewers to question what the hell just happened. It wraps up not only the tragedy, but the other plot points as well with a nice little bow, thus belittling the themes it was working with and steering directly away from the satisfying conclusion that the series was heading towards. Abenobashi wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t about preventing a series of life changing events from occurring, it was about watching Sasshi grow up so he could learn to become mature and accept them as a part of life. By copping out and going for the happiest ending possible, Gainax just wound up insulting the intelligence of both it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s audience and themselves. Frankly, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing but a shadow of the far superior series, FLCL.\n\nMagical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi was originally available from ADV Films, but it was one of the titles they unfortunately had to sell off when they went under several years ago. It was sold to Aesir Holdings, one of the five companies that have Section23 films as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s distributor. The formats that ADV released it under are still available online, like the individual disks, the box set, and the once popular steel-cased \u00e2\u0080\u009cPerfect Collection,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a little on the pricey side. Aesir has released it in a much cheaper collection that you can currently find on Amazon for about 25 dollars\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Or hey, maybe you were lucky enough to grab it from Rightstuf for 15 dollars during their holiday sale last year. A two volume manga series is also available in many locations\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Most likely used\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 For a ridiculously low price, but I should warn that it does follow a different(and raunchier) version of the story. The soundtrack CD is also pretty easy to find, and like the manga, you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t break your bank over it.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be hard pressed to say that there was anything genuinely good about this show. The plot showed some promise early on, and it may have been more enjoyable for a native Japanese audience than it was for American audiences\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But it wound up being confusing and hard to follow, and like many Gainax projects, it lost sight of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s message as it neared the conclusion. The comedy, which many have claimed to be the saving grace of the series, ultimately amounts to a set of keys being jangled in our faces. Some viewers will be stupid enough to be entertained by all the instances of Gainax saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, look, we remember this too!\u00e2\u0080\u0099, but for those of us who aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, this show was just flat out boring. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nowhere near as entertaining as similar shows like Excel Saga and Panty and Stocking, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d just like to point out that neither of those shows are perfect in the first place. With nothing else to offer BUT that comedy, it has nothing else to save it when that comedy fails to entertain. I give Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi a 3/10."}, {"id": 3365, "score": 20, "body": "Survival anime are nothing new when looking back over the last few years. Shows such as Btooom!, Danganropa and Mirai Nikki are all based around a particular survival game and have all found moderate to massive popularity among anime fans. Even outside of anime, you just have to look at franchises like The Hunger Games and Maze Runner to see how successful the subgenre is. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear that stories based around a group of characters, their impending doom and how they try to survive such are intriguing to a lot of people. But why is that? Personally, I believe these kinds of premises can present a darker look at morality; show a darker side to ourselves through characters put in a severe set of circumstances that test one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beliefs, values, friendships. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surprising how a simple concept can turn into a thrilling experience hard to match anywhere else. But this is where I have a problem with most survival anime; they begin with a simplistic setup and never get deeper. Things like character development and thematic exploration are barely touched on in these shows, with more time used for cheap thrills, cringe-worthy horror and overall mindless entertainment. This is an anime that manages to fail at even these aspects.\n\nKing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Game: The Animation is an anime adaptation of a series of \u00e2\u0080\u009ccell phone novels\u00e2\u0080\u009d and is the most recent example of an anime to present us with a survival game that pits everyone against one another until there is one left standing. Considering what I could take from the poorly-designed cover art to the production studio behind it: Seven, who also made a couple Slice of Life comedies I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve barely heard of and a ton of hentai, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have much in the way of expectations that this show would be anything good, but I was hopeful that it would at least be a fun watch. That was a mistake. King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Game follows Nobuaki Kanazawa, the winner of the previous \u00e2\u0080\u009cKing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Game\u00e2\u0080\u009d as he transfers to a new school in an attempt to escape his terrible past. Unfortunately, the game follows him and now his new class are all subjected to the survival game that Nobuaki is all too familiar with. The basic rules of the game are: obey any order sent by the King within 24 hours, failure to do so will result in punishment/death and everyone involved must play to the end. Now, with all the basic information out of the way, here is how King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Game: The Animation manages to turn a rather generic concept into one of the biggest fuckups of the entire year.\n\nThe first major problem with this anime is how it introduces the game, more specifically the \u00e2\u0080\u009corders\u00e2\u0080\u009d from the King that everyone must obey. The first order involves Nobuaki and classmate Natsuko Honda having to kiss, otherwise they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be \u00e2\u0080\u009cpunished\u00e2\u0080\u009d. The first order is extremely childish considering this is supposed to be a game where people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lives are on the line. Show like this need to have some high stakes and consequences to match how serious the game is, also adding suspense and excitement to what characters will do, even if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re predictable. In the first episode, any sense of initial weight here is lost once you see how all of the orders feel like they were made by a 10-year-old. And if you thought ordering people to kiss was already a dumb move, prepare yourself, because most of the orders shown throughout the show are forcing students to have sex with each other. Let me ask, how is one supposed to take a death game seriously at all when a majority of it is about groping breasts and coerced sex? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s absurd and should not be taken seriously. Other dumb orders include not sleeping before you have obeyed an instruction and not doing anything unnecessary for 24 hours. If you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand the last order, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry, the entire game isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worth the time and even the minimal effort required to understand. This is clearly a case of a simple concept turned ridiculous due to how serious the show tries to take it. But what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even more ridiculous is the characters involved in the game.\n\nKing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Game deals with a class of 32 students, not including characters from Nobuaki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past and none of them are developed to where you are supposed to about them except for the protagonist, and even then he comes off so bland and uninteresting that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure a lot of people watching won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care about him or the show a couple weeks after finishing said show. In fact, it probably would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been better to have killed Nobuaki off midway so it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have been so predictably boring. But I digress. Most of the characters are just expendable and are made as victims of the punishments in a poor attempt to justify the gravity of their predicament. Literally about a dozen characters with no prior screen time die on the first day because they were sleeping, and viewers are expected to care? You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t create sympathy from your audience by killing off characters in such a way with their only key feature being that they exist! That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the most obvious examples of lazy writing in anime. But the poor writing doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop there, since most of the characters that do get screen time are completely one-dimensional, have no interesting traits and can be easily replaced with any of the nameless character that got killed off first. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one thing to say in an anime like this you only know a little about 2-3 characters after the first episode, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a whole other issue when half-way through watching, you still only now about a couple of characters when over half of the class is already dead. Not good King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Game, not good.\n\nBut that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not all, because it just so happens that basically every single character in the show is a retard to the point where even if these characters were developed at all, it would still be difficult to feel anything when these characters die because of their own stupidity. The most blatant example of how autistic they can get is when Natsuko is ordered to have sex with a guy, asks to have sex with Nobuaki first, and then when denied does a whole 180 personality-wise, grabbing the initial dude and tries to do the act in front of all her other classmates. They try to play it off saying she was always psychotic and only acted nice, but considering how she was nice to everyone around her and even showed interest in Nobuaki before the game, I see this . But this is just small example compared to the dozens of time where characters show their complete ignorance to what is even happening around them. These characters are still kids, but the idea that most of them are unable to think for themselves what other players are doing in a game of life or death is bewildering to say the least. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like they have selective memory loss where they all just forget what happened 2 minutes before when a character was acting like a lunatic. Even just thinking about how the show would work in our world brings forth a whole new set of questions that the show never ever acknowledges because it knows just how full of bullshit it really is. For example, if so many students in the same class have died in such a short amount of time, wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there be police involved? Wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any of the students try and tell someone who isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a part of the game about what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening? Oh wait, I forgot. This anime doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother showing characters that are not part of the game. The way that King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Game avoids showing any sort of outside influence that would have an impact on the game is enough to tell me that this is nothing more that mindless entertainment at a very low standard.\n\nAnother big issue with King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Game is how it tells its story. The story overall is not difficult to tell but it tries to combine both the present game with flashbacks of the previous game Nobuaki was a part of before transferring and it ends up being detrimental to the show. The flashbacks shown usually take up most of the episode and makes it a lot more difficult for most present-day characters to get any proper focus or development before they are killed off. The characters in these flashbacks can also easily be confused with characters in the present due to how similar all of their designs are, making it harder to differentiate between the two timelines at times. The transitions between the two timelines does not help to distinguish when a time-jump has occurred. I understand that this anime is trying to adapt 2 different instalments to the franchise, but it ends up being so unnecessary as all that was needed to show was few scenes with Nobuaki and his former classmates rather than encompass more than 1 story in 12 episodes. The outcome of the past game is already given as Nobuaki says himself that he was the only survivor. And the saddest part, most of the characters in the flashback are more developed that characters in the current and try to find out what the King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Game really is, when it really should be the other way around as the flashbacks stop at episode 7, leaving us to deal with shit characters play out this shit storyline for the rest of this shit anime.\n\nWhen it comes to the punishments and actual deaths in this anime, I am once again disappointed. Not only because of how cheap so many of these deaths feel, but of how these death are nearly always shameless gore fests, yet not so over-the-top that they end up being hilarious. King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Game is actually very similar to Another, a 2012 horror anime that also featured a cast of school students and had most of them dying in some of the most exaggerated ways possible that it almost turned the show into a comedy. Seriously, watch a couple of the deaths in Another, on their own they are way better than the actual show. I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be surprised if the deaths shown here in King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Game were inspired by Another, but even then, King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Game fails to do that right. It has around the same amount of death and bloodshed as Another, but was never amusing, and while part of that is due to stupid actions by the characters, the execution of these deaths are also just anticlimactic. I never thought I would ever say that seeing a character literally explode in a pile of blood was boring, but alas here we are. Well done King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Game, you even fail at being an entertaining piece of garbage.\n\nNow all that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been said so far should tell you how awful this show is, but here I give you the biggest problem I have with this anime: The King. From the start of the anime the one in charge of ordering and killing off students is shrouded in mystery along with his method of action. The way he comes across as this seemingly omniscient and omnipotent villain had unique powers over victims similar to Light Yagami and the Death Note. But I was more concerned with the why. Why would someone or something so powerful and dangerous being dicking around with a class of teenagers, telling them to fuck each other or die a woeful death? What do they wish to gain from this and why do they not aim for something greater? But then King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Game makes the revelation of the force behind it all, it is perhaps the most idiotic reveal I have seen in an anime. Ever. Anyone else theorizing about what could be behind it all gets figuratively dick-slapped as it makes any work or effort into understanding what this power is and how the students can beat it absolutely worthless! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to reveal the origins of the King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Game but trust me when I tell you that it is almost as disrespectful as getting blue-balled by your partner on Christmas Day (bitch). I mentioned before how all the orders felt like they were conceived by a 10-year-old, but after learning about who the King really is I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be surprised if the original writer had the mental capacity of a 10-year-old. \n\nThe only part of King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Game that I can really commend it on is the production values, but even that has its fair share of problems. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not much of a stickler on the animation of a show, but let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s be real: this show was made in 2017, and it looks like it could have been made over a decade ago. Aside from some backgrounds, there is nothing visually impressive about this show and feels lacklustre for the most part. You just need to see how they animate broken fingers to understand how dull and low budget this project was. But it does have its merits: effective facial expressions convey a lot of emotion and a dark colour palette suited the theme of the show, and I can say that the animation was tolerable. The same goes for the sound, with nothing memorable with regards to OSTs yet nothing godawful. I know a lot of people will praise the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opening as the best of the season, but I found it boring after a few episodes, with the main line \u00e2\u0080\u009cTHIS IS THE END THIS IS THE END!!!!\u00e2\u0080\u009d becoming a meme of the show. And honestly Inuyashiki came out the same season with an OP very similar, but about a dozen times better. The voice acting was below par all across the board, with the English dub being even worse. But if I had to choose, I would still pick the dub, because at least that way I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to think about the show as much, giving my head a well-deserved rest after pushing through this.\n\nAnd there you have it. That is King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Game: The Animation; a disordered, pathetic abomination of an anime I plan to never lay eyes on again. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at the end of 2017 and yet shit like this is still being made, but this is nothing new. King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Game is literally Mayoiga: The Lost Village \u00e2\u0080\u0093 One Year Later, and if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never heard of Mayoiga, just look at its mean score and that will tell you all one needs to know. They were both cringeworthy horror borefests that started off bad and only devolved into something so pathetic that even the biggest advocators of schlock entertainment would find masochistic. At this point, King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Game is worse than just edgy; it cuts deep and it hurts, before leaving a permanent scar; something to always remind you of how foolish you were to try and handle the King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Game. You weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t raped physically, but mentally and emotionally are left desecrated and missing a part of your soul that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never get back. This is the chance one takes when watching any intriguing seasonal anime. Was it worth it? "}, {"id": 3368, "score": 10, "body": "Faster than several events supposedly taking place at the same time\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 More powerful than strings that can hold several tons of weight\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Able to leap fleeing track team members in a single bound\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 This strange visitor from class 13\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The Super Saiyan of our school\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Student Council President Medaka Kurokami! Empowered with athletic superiority, possessing remarkable physical strength, Medaka fights a never-ending battle for truth, justice, and the pretentious appeal to the innate goodness inside of every living being! Disguised as a normal teenage girl, and aided by the friends she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s met along the way, Medaka will stop at nothing to fulfill the hopes and dreams of any student bold enough to leave a request in her suggestion box!\n\nIn one of the most shocking upsets and complete landslides in Sandbox Academy history, the newest Student Council president is, surprisingly, a first year student named Medaka Kurokami\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Or, if you translate it, Black Spirit. While most high schools would elect a student to each individual spot on their student council, but in this case, Medaka wastes no time occupying every slot herself, handing them out to people she interacts with whenever she meets somebody who she thinks will perform them well. She gives the first spot to her childhood friend Zenkichi Hitoyoshi, and with his help, she immediately pledges to use him in her quest to respond to every request that the student body gives her. But can even the over-powered Medaka stretch herself thin enough to keep to this promise without breaking, or has she broken off more than she can chew?\n\nMedaka Box was animated by\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Do I need to say it? I mean, even if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not reading this on my blog during Studio Gainax Month, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take long to figure out who the studio behind this show is. If the color palette and intense focus on female fanservice don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tip you off, the visual direction certainly will. While Gainax isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t normally one to use obscure angles and filters to distract from lengthy dialogue, it does have a nasty habit of using over-the-top, absurd visuals steeped in obvious metaphor to accentuate what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supposed to be more thrilling dialogue. Medaka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speeches to people she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reprimanded can often make her appeal God-like as they shrink away in her presence.\n\nHer power over others is also often expressed through the use of cheesy special effects like light beams and explosions, both of which happen digitally. These effects are pretty cool looking, but unfortunately, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obvious that the bulk of the budget was spent on them. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say the animation is ever bad, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Even at it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worst, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at least executed passably. These two elements of the aesthetic stand in stark contrast to each other for the first two thirds of the series, but when they finally collide in the final act, the animation becomes pure spectacle that could rival even Dragonball Z in terms of the presentation and scale of the destruction.\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing to call home about over-all, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pretty good looking show, and that last third alone earns serious points from me on the visual side of things. What I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t speak so highly of is the character designs. The characters look like\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m saying this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 A cross between Code Geass and Haruhi Suzumiya. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re over-designed, detailed in the weirdest of ways, and have haircuts that are somehow dull while still being strange-looking enough to rival Yugioh. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really only one character in the show who I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a hard time looking at, but that was back when she had interesting expressions that hinted at inner turmoil, all of which disappeared when she donned some fetish glasses and joined the council.\n\nThe music, once again, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really bad, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty damn forgettable. The few times I did notice it, it was because it was over-powering and in some cases even distracted from the dialogue. When I try to listen to the individual tracks on youtube, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something about the synchronizing and the beat that just gives me a headache. This sentiment is carried through to the opening. Happy Crazy Box by Kuribayashi Minami is a moderately catchy song, but the visuals are so standard and effortless that I only really watched them once or twice. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a standard Shounen opening by every possible definition. You get god-like images of the main character, slightly more casual images of her clubmates, and each villain taking their turn to pose and mug for the camera. On the one hand, this opening might spoil who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be joining the council throughout the series, but on the other hand, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all fairly easy to spot through attention to the writing alone.\n\nThe English dub comes to us straight from Sentai Filmworks, care of ADR Director Stephen Foster\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Great! Are we getting an inappropriate rewrite that effectively kills the show, or a faithful-to-the-letter translation that sounds horrible and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even both matching the characters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lip flaps? While neither option is particularly inviting, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still going to say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unfortunately the second one. As I mentioned in my review of Kill Me Baby, Foster had a nasty habit of trying to avoid critics of his writing by not writing at all\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Just putting the direct English translations on screen, and letting his actors wing it. Some of them try to make the speech look natural\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 A few of the side characters manage to pull it off from time to time\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And some even try to reword their lines, but these efforts accomplish little and never last long. Foster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s laziness hits in other ways as well, like how the ending credits are never updated in any episode. The five most important actors are listed respectfully, and then every single other name involved is listed below. In every episode.\n\nThe acting, for the most part, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much better. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always found Shelley Callene-Black to be a very limited actor, as she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a really talented performer when she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s playing a few certain types of characters\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll spare you the list, but \u00e2\u0080\u0098teenage girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099 isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t on it. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even more awkward here than she was in Clannad, if you can believe it. The same sentiment applies to Andrew Love, who does a great job playing adults and tough people\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Like, for example, he was awesome in Log Horizon. So was Ms. Black, incidentally. But as the Lego brick male lead of a romantic comedy, he just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bring anything to the role that a better actor couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trump him on.\n\nHillary Haag plays a charming third wheel, and is one of the few actors who really seems to be trying to make the awkwardly translated dialogue work. Greg Ayres is the other one, having a great time in his villainous role without even bothering to look for depth or complexity that just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there. Tyler Galindo and Maggie Flecknoe round out the rest of the Student Council, but if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m being honest, they both did a pretty terrible job. Galindo was stale and lifeless, while Flecknoe was just all over the place. I know that in both cases you could say the same thing about their characters, but still, they should have at least tried to rise above the material they were given, like Ayres, Haag and Monica Rial did.\n\nI actually did listen to a few episodes in Japanese with subtitles, and I highly recommend that track instead of the dub. Yuki Ono and Aki Toyosaki sound a lot more natural and down to earth than Love and Black do, and as much as I enjoyed Greg Ayres as a villain, the legendary Romi Park\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 You know, the Seiyuu of Edward Elric? Just sounds as slimy and blood-thirsty as a talking snake in the same role. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easily sub-over-dub, which is kind of unfortunate because, considering the ridiculous nature of the series, I honestly wish Foster had gone with the first of the two options I listed earlier\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Rude, outlandish dialogue that offends everybody while making tongue-in-cheek jokes about it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own story, especially since this story\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Eh-hehm\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 This story\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\nSay, who here loves the Rightstuf.com holiday sale? I do! I send Rightstuf obscene amounts of my disposable income in exchange for heavily discounted anime every year. I ordered a bunch of titles last year, most of which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never seen before, and among them was a quaint little title that I quickly realized was part of the eclectic school club genre\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 A genre that was inspired by Haruhi Suzumiya before getting warped by harem influences. I went in with apprehensions, but was pleasantly surprised by the engaging dialogue, rich characters, and what felt like a genuine attempt to deepen the main relationships and flesh out some of the side characters. It ultimately failed to live up to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lofty ambitions and escape the trappings of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s genre, but I still found it to be a breath of fresh air compared to similar titles like Haganai and Oreshura. That title\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Was not Medaka Box. It was My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU. In contrast, Medaka Box didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s genre ANY favors.\n\nTo start with, one of the first observations I made about this series\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 That it just refused to try to prove me wrong on\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Is that it had, at most, two brain cells, and that they were completely incapable of rubbing up against each other long enough to form a coherent thought. Yes, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve called anime stupid before, but this is on an entirely different level. Every single moment in this series, from the plot twists to the decisions the characters make to the occasional details of backstory, is more stupid than the last. To start, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take a quick glance at the characters.\n\nThe title character Medaka is so perfect at everything she does that it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take you very long to start thinking she isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really human. She can run faster than the best member of the Track and Field team, jumping dozens of feet in the air while doing it. She can stand on a pair of water wings in the middle of the pool without falling into the water, she won millions of dollars by answering the worlds\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hardest math problem when she was in middle school, and she can even strike multiple kendo opponents at once while a friend insists that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s human. Almost everything she does is explained to the audience via exposition from Hitoyoshi about why it makes sense according to her backstory. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty much the only reason he exists, by the way. Oh, and of course, Medaka is such a perfect fantasy girlfriend\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Excuse me, main character\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also an exhibitionist who doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind constantly stripping down to her undies, just for the hell of it.\n\nEven when a character is interesting upon their introduction, they quickly either lose all of their unique qualities, or just fade into the background, but leaving aside the characters and their development, the writing of this series is just unsalvageble. Every single turn of the plot is random, often to the point of being self-contradictory. To be honest, I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sure what example from the story I would use to demonstrate just how terribly written it is, as every time I thought I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d picked a winner, a new example would pop up, stunning the shit out of me. I could not go a single episode without asking some variety of \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat the fuck?\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you kidding me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d or to my ever increasing chagrin, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey can NOT be that stupid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nYou know what? Instead of just picking one example, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to go with three. Yup. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m giving you some bonus nitpicking, you special people, you. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ever say I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t love you. To start, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s examine just how much ADHD went into the thought process behind this show by examining a single episode\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 No, it was half of an episode, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pretty sure. We hear Medaka proclaim that her goal is to fulfill every request she gets, to the letter, without any regard to the consequences, and already, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even tell you how many ways this promise could be abuse, but let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s get back on topic.\n\nA girl hires her to help her write a love letter, claiming she has bad handwriting. Medaka hands this job off to one of her council members, who then writes the entire letter for the client, and when Medaka hears about this, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty disappointed\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Not by the fact that he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go the obvious route of simply dictating the letter, but because the letter was in his words, and thus would be meaningless to the receiver. So how does he rectify his mistake? I am not kidding about this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 He teaches the client to have better handwriting. So this entire plot about coming up with your own words that are true to your heart is spawned from a request for HANDWRITING advice. Which is great, because if they performed her request to the letter, there might have been long term consequences\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 We can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have that!\n\nOh, but it gets better. In a later episode, Medaka and her council is trying to figure out how to allocate the school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s club funds to all the various school clubs. Their solution? Instead of analyzing the situation and coming up with a smart plan\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Remember, this chick won millions by answering an impossible math problem\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They decide to hold an athletics festival in the middle of a fucking swimming pool, while very vaguely stating that the results will decide the budget. Now, some people complain that the swimming club will have an unfair advantage, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s okay, because the student council is entering too, just to fight them!\n\nMedaka says she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll triple the budget of any team that surpasses hers out of her own pocket, but the details don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supposed to be focusing on the fact that the swim team is using reckless tactics to win, because they all grew up poor and they love money. They chose an unsafe way to swim to the bottom of an over-twenty-foot pool and grabbing balls to throw in the weird sports fest basket thingies? Oh no, they should have been rapidly submerging and resurfacing the safe way! What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that? During the three-legged race through the shallow pool, they swam, kicking in harmony? That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just dangerous! And then you have to get used to the idea that this whole debacle was written just to give them an excuse to have Medaka kiss the female swimmer. Oh, and she gets recruited to the council, but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry, we never have to explore her troubled backstory\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 She loses almost all personality after this.\n\nBut you know what? Those examples are just kid stuff. Those aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t all that bad. Yeah, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re incredibly freaking stupid and make no recognizeable version of sense, but those ultimately amount to little more than light complaints. If a stupid show that couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stay focused on it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own plot was an immediate turn-off for me, I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have such a big soft spot for Angel Beats. No, to truly earn my fury, this show would have to royally shoot itself in the foot\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Which it soundly does. So, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re coming to the third example, and I have to warn you, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bit of a spoiler, but only a bit. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably the most significant event in the entire series in my opinion, but it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t treated as anything more than the springboard for the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s climax, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not giving too much away by telling you about it. Still, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been warned.\n\nTowards the end of the show, the Student council has a run-in with the disciplinary committee, who are upset about the council\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wardrobe adjustments. She hounds them for a bit, before realizing that she can just use the suggestion box to solve the problem(I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell you what she requests, just know that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s NOT \u00e2\u0080\u009cI request the Student Council dress more conservatively), and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eventually won over. Well, the Chairman of the committee is a lot more hardcore than her. Enter Greg Ayres\u00e2\u0080\u0099 villain, who gets called to the school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orchestra club to deal with a noise complaint, and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 He kills them. Yup. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all there is to it. He slaughters all but two of them, and the fact that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fucking mass murderer just gets glossed over for the rest of the three episode climax.\n\nThere have been plenty of anime that I thought should have, in some way, involved the police. Characters take illegal actions, and I think \u00e2\u0080\u009cCall the police, problem solved.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This is the first character I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gotten away with literally murdering a whole club room full of teenaged boys and girls who have families, and friends, and HOW THE FUCK DOES THIS NOT GET MENTIONED AGAIN?! This was the moment that I went from nitpicking to pass the time to full on hating the show and all it represented, and oh yeah, while we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re here, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talk about what it was that it represented.\n\nThe over-all message of Medaka box\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yes, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a message it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trying to tell us, and if Medaka constantly getting called pretentious isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a good enough clue, let me help you. The message of Medaka box is that there is innate goodness in all people, and no matter what they do\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 No matter what the crime, no matter what their behavior, no matter how sick and revolting they are\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 You shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t punish them, because through kindness and understanding, they can be reformed. Scratch that, I know *EXACTLY* why the mass murder is never brought up again\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The sooner you forget about it, the less you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be compelled to ask if the families of all those slaughtered would be satisfied in knowing that the kid who left them grieving was beaten in battle, reformed, and then recruited to be the new vice president of the student council, instead of becoming somebody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lovely bunkmate in prison. Oops, that was a spoiler, but you know what? Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all you need to know about this show in order to spoil the whole damn thing: Medaka is the mouthpiece of an extremely naive and ignorant worldview, and everything that happens, no matter how unlikely the event or how incomprehensible the decision, is made to support her grandstanding in one way or another. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a chance she might get proven wrong in season 2, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, and I never will know, because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m never touching this series again with a sixty foot pole.\n\nMedaka Box is available from Sentai Filmworks in both DVD and Blu-ray formats, both of which are pretty expensive if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find a good sale on them. The manga, by author Nisioisin and illustrator Akira Akatsuki is available stateside through it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s run in Shounen Jump, but has unfortunately not been released in standalone paperback yet. Unless of course you speak Spanish or French. A Second season, which is called Medaka Box Abnormal, is also available from Sentai Filmworks, and from what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard, it runs on a premise that may actually redeem Medaka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The fact that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not human.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been doing Studio Gainax month for three years now, and in that time, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come across some huge disappointments. I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a fan of Abenobashi, His and Her circumstances or Stella Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Academy, but Medaka Box is easily the worst Gainax show I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enjoy a single second of this shallow excuse for fanservice exploitation. I might have been more lenient on it if it were just stupid, and never left the boundaries of being laughably bad, but it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It used a pointlessly grim-dark tonal shift at the top of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s third act to suddenly start pretending to take itself seriously just because it felt it had to. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what it was building to, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care. I give Medaka Box a 1/10, and the only reason I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m giving it that much is because the animation was decent, and despite that ugly thing they did, the final act did have a lot of neat, enjoyable action in it. Other than that, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m done with this."}, {"id": 3369, "score": 0, "body": "Popotan is a 2003 anime series about three magical sisters and their maid, who travel through time and space in their mysterious, enchanted house. Every time their house phases out of the physical realm, it jumps into the future by about five years, finding a new location with an ample supply of dandelions for the girls to extract more magic from. They can communicate with these dandelions, but they also make time to communicate with the people\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They live in whatever area the house landed in, carrying on normal lives in society until they need to leave again.\n\nWhy don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they wait for Dandelions to die and be replaced by new ones, which should happen in fairly quick succession considering the short life span of a dandelion? Well, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not get ahead of ourselves.\n\nOur main character, at least in the anime, is Mei, the middle child. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a tomboy, as well as the emotional center of the story, who is always forming the tightest social connections outside of the family. Her insistence that they should quit their journey and settle down leads us to several revelations throughout the show, and while I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad they used this plot device instead of endless exposition dumps, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still generally information that they\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And we, as well\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Should have known from the beginning.\n\nHer older sister, Ai, has giant breasts and glasses. And\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 She probably has some sort of personality.\n\nHer little sister, Mii, is a hyper little moppet who loves dressing up as a magical girl and is obsessed with poofy-poofies. She likes to snuggle Ai\u00e2\u0080\u0099s poofy-poofies, and makes remarks about Mei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s poofy-poofies being too small.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give you five seconds to figure out what \u00e2\u0080\u0098poofy-poofies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 are, and if it actually takes you that long, you should go bash your head against something.\n\nThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looked after by their devoted maid, Maya, a long-suffering sarcastic woman who cares deeply about her charges. A lot of people theorize that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a robot, but since she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shown eating take-out on camera, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unlikely.\n\nSo, based on what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve just told you, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re probably expecting me to say that Popotan is some dumb, wacky little comedy. I mean, with the Drifting Classroom style house, the dandelion-flavored plot, and the cliched characters, you probably expect this to be full of wacky randomness in the vein of Magical Play. After all, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why Magical Play works\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It has a quick pace, and the joke-a-minute delivery fits the gleefull randomness to a T.\n\nThe truth is, Popotan isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like that at all. The pacing is slow, the story is played completely straight, and the tone of the series is more along the lines of sentimental and atmospheric. This is a great choice of execution for a serious coming-of-age story like Beck, but when juxtaposed with Popotan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ridiculous\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Everything\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not so much a match made in heaven as it is a match made in Shou Tucker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basement. When you combine this tone-deaf approach with the constant fan-service, Popotan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempts at emotional depth just come off as incompetent, insincere melodrama.\n\nSpeaking of which, when I was only half-way through this show, I noticed that MAL listed it as Rated R for \u00e2\u0080\u0098mild nudity,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and I flipped out in the forums. Compared to Popotan, the average Playboy magazine only has \u00e2\u0080\u0098mild nudity.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 There is at least one bath scene in every episode, and all four of our main characters\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 As well as several side characters\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Get in on the action. And there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no convenient fog here, folks, oh no. Every single nipple is meticulously and painstakingly drawn in, even for the little girl Mii. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get me wrong, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m no prude\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I love Strike Witches, and even have a soft spot for the clunky This Ugly Yet Beautiful World, Gainax pretense be damned. Those shows have more to offer than just nudity, which I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t honestly say about Popotan.\n\nThe nudity really is the only thing this show has to offer, and even taking that into consideration, the characters are so poorly designed and badly drawn that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like looking at a horny twelve-year-old\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sketchbook. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s saying nothing about how creepy the fan-service is. This show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pedophile vibe is so intense that it makes UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie look innocent by comparison.\n\nThe artwork and animation suck\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go any deeper than that, just trust me\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and the stories of the individual episodes aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just badly written, but in a way that could actually be considered dangerously irresponsible with the message they try to send. The relationships that our cast form are sophomoric at best and unhealthy at worst.\n\nThe strongest relationship that Mii forms\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Aside from her metafictional relationship with pedophilic viewers\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Is with a little Shinto girl who wants to celebrate Christmas. The idea on it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sound like anything bad, but the way it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pursued is bafflingly ignorant. The strongest relationship that Ai forms is with a little boy whom she bathes naked with, and then kisses full on the mouth later on. And the strongest relationship that Mei forms is so deeply wrapped up in contradictory bullshit and disturbingly damaged human behavior that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have to spend an entire paragraph of spoilers just to explain what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong with it.\nAnd on top of that, get this:  We never find out anything about the plot.  We never learn basic pieces of information like how the girls got their powers, why they decided to start traveling, what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to accomplish\u00e2\u0080\u00a6  The only answer you ever get is a big, fat \u00e2\u0080\u0098play the game,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to which I can only respond \u00e2\u0080\u0098screw you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099  You should never have to check out the source material just to enjoy the adaptation.  That is the absolute worst kind of crutch a story can lean on.\n\nIf I had to say some positive things about this show, I can name three off the top of my head.\n\n1: Anna Cummer does a decent job playing the voice of Maya. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a subtle and nuanced performance, but if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m being honest, somebody more talented like Michelle Ruff would have blown her completely out of the water. Then again, compared to the rest of her co-stars, Anna might as well BE Michelle Ruff.\n\n2: There are a handful of ways this show could have been worse.\n\n3: Umm\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I think I may have grossly overestimated my capacity for complimenting this show.\n\nAll in all, I would rather kill myself with a spoon than recommend this show to anybody. Even if it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t offend the everloving daylights out of you, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing good about it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 At all. In fact, the only reason my friends are currently borrowing my soon-to-be destroyed copy is because they asked for it, to see what kind of series could piss me off this much. Popotan is just so insidiously bad that it may actually be bad FOR you, as a person.\n\nOver the years, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve given a handful of 1/10 reviews, with my general reason being that as crappy as they are, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something good about them\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Maybe there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a decent voice cast, or a few good characters, or some good action, or maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just so hilariously bad that it would be fun to watch while drunk. But Popotan is just a dreary, off-putting experience that I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t imagine any amount of alcohol saving. For the first time in my reviewing career, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m giving Popotan a 0/10. Avoid at all costs, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll thank me later.  "}, {"id": 3371, "score": 39, "body": "*spoilers for Akame ga Kill*\n\nAkame ga Kill is an endearing case of stupidity and an inability to take itself seriously when it needs to while taking itself seriously when it shouldn't. It's far too edgy for its own good, and it's a riot to indulge in, thanks in no small part to its incompetence, blatant spelling out of already black and white matters, and it's tonal incoherence...or at least it starts that way. It then grows into a more generic and edgy anime that tries and largely fails to wring intended emotions out of us with mostly generic and bad characters, equally badly inserted humor, and improper backstory dumps that are either too early and never reinforced or too late and never reinforced. Alright so, just how bad can it really be with all of that said? Is it some part of Akame ga Kill's plan to kill our brain cells until all we can say is \"ga\"? Well, with that little conspiracy theory out of the way, let's find out, shall we?\n\nThere is something to be said when your first episode is so rushed, edgy, and tonally incomprehensible, that it automatically informs you that this show is not gonna be pleasant. I mean, the first episode is schlock at its finest, hence my accusations at the preamble. I mean, it doesn't even name a single location, and in fact, not a single location in this series has a proper name, which really sells how horrific the world-building for this show really is. After Tatsumi is roped into joining Night Raid, episodes 2-8 are, for most part, asshole of the week type episodes, at least until two of its members die: Sheele in episode 6, and Bulat in episode 8. It is here that we encounter a few more problems (one of which sorta surfaced in episode 1 but could've been rectified). \n\nFirst, the Danger Beasts. We know not of much of the species present here, and there are no real defined danger tiers. They're just there for people to kill while being acknowledged as powerful beings. Second, and thankfully this goes away, but this section of the series is so blatant about being black and white that when a terrible person is having a villain monologue, the anime decides to visualize them as literal monsters, because the audience of gore and boob-loving 14-year-olds apparently needs to be blatantly told that these awful people are monsters.  Subtlety; it's what this series rarely has. Thirdly, the goddamn tone-shift comedy moments. Episode 1 is a major example of this, with the show constantly cutting its serious or even sad mood short in order for a quick, unfunny gag, and then it cuts back. It's really jarring and tonally incomprehensible at times. Finally, and this is the most pervasive and problem-encompassing of the issues, the Imperial arms. \n\nThere are 48 of them (yet we never see even half of them), and for some reason, none of these can be recreated with modern day AGK technology and magic (because of course a magic gun can't be manufactured; that would make sense) and they each have hidden abilities that are often conveniently pulled out of a character's ass (especially Akame's from episode 24 (which somehow doesn't poison her like it does for anyone else who gets cut), Esdeath's from episode 21 which freezes time for an unknown amount of time for the will of the writers to screw her or someone else over, and Tatsumi's golden Incursio form from episode 23). Don't get me started on Mine's \"Pumpkin Pinch\" which almost always occurs when she decides that she's in a pinch without actually being in one (because outnumbered automatically equals pinch). Also, the Imperial Arms are only compatible with a user if said user has a great first impression of it, which is insanely dumb since that means the only way for it to choose you is for you to geek out over it, and nothing else. And, if you allow me to jump ahead for a bit, episode 23 introduces an asspull in which there were this secret Divine Imperial Arms all along, jacking up the count from 48 to 49, and being strong enough to fuck over the unnamed city (you heard me). We'll return to this travesty moment in a bit since we gotta move on with the actual plot of the series, which is also a travesty.\n\nEpisodes 9-19 are effectively part 2 of the show, with part 1 being what i described earlier and part 3 being...we'll get there. This new part brings out a new organization by this evil empire that Night Raid has fought against, called the Jaegers, comprising of 7 powerful members of the Capital, most notably, the brutal ice wielder, Esdeath. Tatsumi gets his ass captured, escapes, and then Dr. Stylish (like an Idiot), leads an assault on Night Raid with his bio army, not even informing or bringing along the other Jaegers like a smart member would do, and of course, after Susanoo is introduced  to fight alongside Night Raid, Stylish gets his ass killed by Akame. Then, after Chelsea comes in and both she and Susanoo are indoctrinated into the group, and Tatsumi and Esdeath are teleported to and back from an island, we get Kurome's ability to revive fallen members and danger beasts (and she could've brought Chelsea and Bulat back to really hamstring our heroes but she isn't that smart), and both Bols and Chelsea die. Then, the 4 Kouken Temple Rakshasa demons, 3 of which are killed by Lubbock in the exact same episode they're introduced, which is just plain pathetic. I mean, the Garou Knights from Fairy Tail were a more credible threat than these guys; at least the Garou Knights lasted for more than one episode. The final demon member gets killed by Tatsumi really easily in the next episode (in the anime, not in the manga), and Seryuu is killed. \n\nNow, for the final 5 episodes: the anime original episodes. Here, both groups are brought down to 2 living members, with the deaths of everyone except: Akame, Najenda, Wave, and Run. Even main character Tatsumi dies, which is rare. That guy who teleported Tatsumi and Esdeath (his name is Shura) and Lubbock kill each other after a Night Raid Plan goes wrong and Tatsumi is captured by Budou (who kills and is killed by Mine), and Susanoo sacrifices himself against Esdeath to get everyone (including Tatsumi) out of a wrecked colosseum. Akame and Kurome duke it out (Kurome apparently is slowly dying from the drugs she was injected in when she was a kid, and she still didn't try to summon anyone from Night Raid to really torment Akame in battle like a smart wielder of her weapon would do in her situation), and then that new Imperial Arms appears with the young boy emperor using it to wreck everything in episode 23, where the story takes one final plunge from awful to rock bottom. Then, Akame and Esdeath duke it out with asspulls aplenty, and then we actually...get a satisfying finale. \n\nI mean it when I say that the finale to this series is genuinely good, at least the second half of it, after the whole Akame vs Esdeath fiasco. The horrible prime minister who made the empire toxic ended up getting his head smashed by Leone (who get shot a bunch of times by him), Leone says goodbye, goes back to her now happy city (or something, we don't know the name or even if it's a city, town, or village) and the dies there while knowing the difference her and her group's efforts made, and the empire gets a new mode of government, with both main groups (Jaegers and Night Raid, or what's left of them) dissolve and join together (except Akame) and Najenda says one last goodbye to the already dead Lubbock, carrying his headband. Despite the idiotic final fight and the edgy and even more idiotic nature of the series, the finale is genuinely satisfying and sweet, which is far more than I can say for any anime of or near Akame ga Kill's admittedly low caliber.\n\nA majority of the characters in Akame ga Kill barely do anything to avoid being totally one-dimensional, especially our protagonists, and a lot of them do incredibly stupid things, including my Dr.Stylish and Kurome examples from earlier. Another problem with these characters is that backstories are handled horrendously. They are often used as death flags like with Bulat and Bols (in which they die either the same episode or the next episode afterwards) almost never actually animated (since we either see them explain it with no flashback footage or they're so short that they only last up to 25 with little animation) with the only exceptions being Sheele's, Akame's, Kurome's, Najenda's and Esdeath's backstories, 2 of which are mainly done in the episode Kurome dies where the backstories of both her and Akame are fully shown instead of partially shown, and the rest, barring Najenda's, never really being reinforced except at one key moment, with no better example than MIne's generic \"raised and bullied in the slums\" backstory that has  no remote elaboration on anything like why she joined Night Raid. It's bad enough that one of these backstories are used for \"episode I die in\" scenarios in which we never really got to connect with a character and see many facets of him/her, and it's bad enough that some of them (like Wave and Lubbock) don't even have backstories, but some are down with literally no provocation or narrative reason, like Leone's and Mine's (until MIne's gets reinforced in episode 19 so that she can kill Seryuu). In fact, I can't even remember Leone's backstory, just the fact that she has one.\n\nThe protagonists of the series (Night Raid) are pretty terrible and largely generic, and it's pretty sad when most of the notable villains are better written and more likable than them. Let's start with Tatsumi. In the beginning, he an unlikeable and pompous idiot, and through development, he becomes a very, very generic protagonist. Bulat, his \"bro\", has 2 traits: manly, and gay; that's all there is to him aside from his death flag backstory. The two have this Simon and Kamina dynamic, and it lasts an eerily similar amount of time as Simon's and Kamina's, with eerily similar impacts to the surviving protagonists, except Simon and Kamina are legendary characters while these two just suck. Akame is one of the better protagonist, though all she amounts to is an edgier, discount Saber with a twisted poison weapon. Lubbock is a generic badass pervert who manages to get the most amount of important kills next to Akame now that I think about it. Sheele is a typical hot, clumsy who is more interesting due to her also being a savant in killing people, and Leone is the energetic, fan-service tease. Now, Mine...where do we begin with this bitch...\n\nMine is the my most hated character in this show by a gigantic margin, one of the worst Tsunderes in history, and one of my most hated characters in fiction, up there with the likes of Suzaku Kururugi from Code Geass and Shin Asuka from Gundam SEED Destiny; I am not kidding here. Her levels of hypocrisy are unmatched in this show, her bitchy and even lethal attitude and actions towards Tatsumi is infuriating to the point where I nearly dropped the show because of her on multiple occasions, and by the end, she just becomes a by the numbers tsundere in all aspects. There is literally nothing good I can say about this character except that I'm glad the show killed her off. Fuck Mine and everything about her!\n\nChelsea, conversely, is my favorite character, in large part due to how she manages to aggravate Mine, and the fact that she has lollipops. She's a bit harder for me to define in a singular characteristic, but she's very playful, cold, and somber all at once, thanks in no small part due to her backstory (that is unseen) of her previous team dying in front of her. Susanoo is very picky about details and is simply the stoic cool guy that has literally every single convenient housekeeping trait a woman wants in a man: the perfect husbando, if you will, which is the antithesis of Sheele's character. Najenda is simply a military leader who kicks the ass of anyone who offends her. That wraps up the Night Raid members; now for the Jaegers...and everyone else...shit.\n\nEsdeath is a hot, powerful yandere sadist who has this \"survival of the fittest\" mentality. Refreshingly, she also feels great pity for any comrade who dies, and often leaves a few people alive in hopes that they'll get stronger in order to provide a greater challenge for her since she's a blood knight. Unfortunately, the filler episodes betray her character big time by making her only the bare bones version of what I described with none of the added remorse and ill-intended mercy I mentioned prior. Wave is basically Tatsumi, but better in every way imaginable, including fashion sense, hair, and Imperial Arms, so we don't really need to go over him and his lack of backstory. Kurome is a more crazed likelier than Akame is, and she also really, really wants to be the one to kill her. SHe's also dying from the drugs injected into her in her backstory that made her a better assassin, which wasn't brought up or remotely hinted at until episode 20. Run was a teacher until his students died in which he decided to take the Suzaku Kururugi route of trying to change the government without actually doing anything other than becoming a soldier in their ranks, and he's a very suspicious and uninteresting character. I can't really remember much about him other than his backstory, methods, and angel wing Imperial Arms. Skipping Dr.Stylish because all he is, is a crazed and stupid mad scientist who really likes when things are \"stylish\". Bols is probably the best of the bunch. His intimidating mask is to cover up how he is insanely shy to the point of not wanting to show his face until Esdeath takes the mask off and makes him eat with the very welcoming Jaegers in probably the most heartwarming scene of the show. He even has a wife and kid whom he communicates within an adorable and actually real manner. He basically carries the more human and successfully emotional side of Akame ga Kill, and while the show tries to hard to be emotions, it rarely works and I'll explain why later. Still, while Chelsea is my favorite character here, Bols is easily the best written, even if that doesn't really mean much here.\n\nI'm sure I'm in a minority when I say that I don't hate Seryuu Ubiquitous. That doesn't mean that she's a good character, but she easily could've been. Plus, I have a bias for anyone who manages to hurt or aggravate Mine consistently, except Tatsumi 'cuz he's lame. They try to make us emotional for Seryuu and put her in a more sympathetic light despite her hypocritical, knight templar tendencies, but they fail miserably. They either do it too early or too late, and no better example than with the death of Dr.Stylish. She didn't interact much with him but then we see her cry over his grave and have a backstory moment about how he was her patron and that he gave her multiple gun implants. If this series was written better, we would've seen them have a really strong, established connection like with Tatsumi & Bulat. Her violent side is also cartoonish as hell to the point where I can't hate her; reason being, I can never take her seriously with those facial expressions that make Code Geass wince. I mean, shark teeth? This is supposed to be taken seriously yet her face becomes the kind of expressive that feels like she belongs in a Saturday morning cartoon. But enough about her and why I can't take her seriously; let's discuss the other people!\n\nPrime Minister Honest (why?) is a manipulative, fat, gluttonous, greedy monster, as if he was the poster-boy for his archetype. Though his dinner interactions with the child emperor (who doesn't even have a name despite being important, especially in episode 23) are genuine-feeling and nice. Shura is a typical complete monster, treating people's lives like toys and Budou is a general who randomly shows up in episode 20 while also being talked about in some of the middle episodes, and he's just an OP general dude, nothing more than that. Plus, he, a being who is supposedly stronger than even Esdeath, is killed by Mine...wow. I already mentioned the 4 demon guys, and I'm literally not even gonna mention any of the minor characters from episode 1-8 or any of the guys summoned by Kurome; they're not worth mentioning whatsoever and have dreadfully dull characterization at the best of times.\n\nWhile this is not as well animated as say, Steins;Gate, Studio White Fox still did a pretty good job with a lot of the animation and set-pieces of Akame ga Kill, even if their trademark White Fox eyes are unfortunately missing. There are some great looking set-pieces, like the destroyed Imperial Arms used in the background of the Akame vs Esdeath fight. There is also insanely minimal CGI which is a rarity in anime nowadays. The fights are often well animated and the different fighting styles of the weapons are all in full display, from swords to gunplay to strings and what have you. Even the danger beasts look interesting to a decent extent. This isn't Fate/Zero or Unlimited Blade Works or anything, but it still looks pretty good, especially the Akame vs Kurome fight, even if a lot of the earlier fights use the bad DBZ spam thing of characters pulling off an insanely unrealistic amount of hits with things.\n\nThe OST is pretty decent, with some really standout tracks like the amazing catchy Hindi track \"Sakaba\", the rustic-feeling \"Kinpaku\", or the amazing and most notable track of all: \"Le chant de Roma\". Also, the emotional \"Sheele OST\" and \"Yume Monogatari\" are just beautiful, even if the show doesn't do as well in making the emotional moments work as well narratively. OP1 \"Skyreach\" by Sora Amamiya, is a mostly generic OP but I always like the part right before the chorus, and the final 13 or so seconds. OP2, \"LIAR MASK\" by Rika Mayama, is bloody amazing and if used for a better anime that was long enough for it to feel like a journey, would honestly be really gratifying and tear-jerking; it is that amazing, even if this show is unworthy of it. Both EDs are mainly generic and not noteworthy despite trying to be emotional. \n\nThe dub is pretty bad. I cannot recognize a single person in the cast list, so I guess this was to be expected. Some voices work well and make certain insignificant moments better, but the voices of Akame and Esdeath in particular are really not working for the characters, and Akame's often sounds flat as sin, and some emotional moments are even ruined by the dub script and voices. Stick to sub for this one.\n\nInevitably I was going to be really harsh on Akame ga Kill, since it's a pretty terrible show in and of itself. It manages to cycle through almost every single kind of bad you can think of, but I could never bring myself to hate or, or even truly dislike it. You'd think that I would since it has given me almost every reason to, but I simply can't. The first two episodes were hilarious in how bad they were while 3 and 4 were infuriating (and guess which character made them that way and nearly made me drop the show because of it). Then, with aggravating and hilarious exceptions, this show put me in this serene trance of mild boredom. I was never all that angry but never all that entertained, just, at peace in my mind while watching this show. I could've never predicted that from a show like this, and it's because of that, that I'm not angry at it or showing no mercy, even if the way I tackled the plot and characters may make you think otherwise. \n\nAkame ga Kill is an edgy, silly show that tries way too hard to be cool and shocking while simultaneously trying way too hard to be emotional, despite the script failing to make it work. It fails to establish a strong enough and compelling enough connection between a lot of its characters for their deaths to wring out the emotions they should, like with the death of Sheele, even if the music is just begging you to cry. It beseeches you to feel for these generic shounen characters in this fake seinen world but it just doesn't know how to build anything up properly, nor does it even use its shounen elements properly. It's an absolute mess that was simply blessed with a good animation studio and some good music. It tries and fails at almost every opportunity, rarely earning anything, even if there are subtleties and sweet moments worth defending. Well, with all that said, this has easily been the hardest review I've ever had to do by a gigantic margin, so, thank you for reading, and I bid you adieu.  "}, {"id": 3374, "score": 47, "body": "So, Isekai, Monster Hunter, and early day Iron-Blooded Orphans, and combining all of these parts together, you get...a terribly mediocre show! That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right, ladies and gentlemen, this show is a somewhat fun, mechanical, mess! An entertaining but very badly written Isekai show that had a ton of passion for the art of giant robots. That means despite not being very good (to the point where mediocre is giving it a bit too much credit), I can respect and enjoy it to some degree. So, why is it still mediocre, and what about all this really gets me to enjoy it aside from its spirit? Well, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s find out, shall we?\n\nThere are...a ton of problems unfortunately with the narrative. For one, a ton of stuff is basically the narrator I explaining story beats or skipping stuff and saying what happened in between. It gives me Gundam Wing flashbacks and that is not ok. For a civilization about creating mechs to fend off beasts, knowing that they haven't made any remote innovation in the past century is rather disconcerting, especially when you consider the nature of a typical mecha show. When Ernesti (back then known as Kurata) dies in that original life, he just died without fanfare and we don't see what happened to him, let alone how he became reborn into this world. It also implies that he just basically hijacked the body of the boy he became; that's kinda fucked up. There are some real asspulls too, like how Ernesti used magic to pilot the Guair out of nowhere and how he was strong enough to pull the controls out despite other characters tugging on them quite hard just to move. I get that these run on magic, but again, this came out of nowhere.\n\nThere are other errors and dumb moments too, like when Kerhild had a chance to slay Edgar, whose Knight mech had been disabled, she (according to the visual damage since that was offscreen) simply slammed her sword into the cockpit and left instead of thrusting the sword through it to finish him. A potentially cool battle in episode 5 is skipped and given that there is some sort of war that gets ignited, the amount of time skips in development while nothing happens is disconcerting. I do like how they spend a lot of time on the building process and the camaraderie that comes of it though, even if they sorta still gloss over it. Not helping anything is the fact that Ernesti kinda dances near Gary Stu territory, nor is the fact that the pacing is a bit out of whack thanks to the obscene SAO level time skips.\n\nThat said, there are some moments that are actually pretty good, like with the king and his random duking it out for a flashy mech and showing that they're both the same basically, except one has withered a bit with age. I'm not going to really spoil too much here though despite the overall lukewarm opinion I have on the show. Even still, they can't save this pretty ravaged script that somehow gets crazier and more ludicrous in the second half. The final 5 episodes in particular are far too fast-paced given the contents within, and thus come off as disjointed that they introduce a bunch of holes and errors. I feel like they should've been their own cour to work at all, so that doesn't help matters either.\n\nErnesti is really OP. This kinda cuts both ways. It's nice to see that he takes his skills from his world to this one, so of course he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knowledgeable about giant robots, but to know that with all this, he also becomes a top tier magic expert who innovates there too, is a stretch. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basically a spunky skid, and that's fun enough to see, but he does become unreasonably OP overall despite there being a good reason for some of what he can do. Unfortunately, he comes dangerously close to Gary Stu territory, always making so many advances with mainly his ideas and little outside input, having most of everything revolve around him (and I'll explain those ramifications in a bit), and being the only one to come up with crazy new  innovations, as well as some of the other aforementioned things. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s saving him a bit is his enthusiasm and passion for robots, the fact that some of what he is capable of is understandable right out the get-go, and the fact that even his stuff notably needs work, leading to himself other people being able to modify his ideas. The fact that he is a mecha enthusiast gives me some bias towards him though. The dude has fucking orgasms over this shit.\n\nI'm sure many of us can agree that Shirley from Code Geass is not a good character, right? I mean, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basically there to kiss up to the MC and always devote everything about her character to him, to some extent at least. Well, Adeltrud aka \u00e2\u0080\u009cAddy\u00e2\u0080\u009d is some next level shit! The only thing separating her from being Miyuki tier shit here is the fact they there is no incest love at all, but it is still a one-sided crush. Thankfully it sometimes gets played to admittedly humorous degrees but this is largely her character. \n\nThis, in particular, brings us to that whole Gary Stu issue. You see, since so much of this show is focused on Ernesti, his energy, and how awesome he is, we don't really get to see the other characters shine, a common symptom of a Gary Stu character. I'm not even gonna try to list the characterizations of the other character for this reason. I'm just thankful they don't come off as horrendous character archetypes, and some that come close, like the old man rival engineer, do get somewhat subverted (that way he isn't just a senile and jealous old coot character, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one that eventually finds passion again, thanks to you know who) or otherwise have something to safe then from being just a bad archetype. Doesn't mean that the cast isn't bad, because it most certainly is, though again, biases to some characters like Ernesti, and the absolutely gorgeous Helvi, even though they're not actually good characters. Besides, I don't even wanna get started in the villain characters, especially the ones from the final arc, which are all terrible and generic. There are some attempts to show some character relationships but they all fall flat too, and when we are often missing useful characters, that's a problem too for an already bloated but lacking cast.\n\nStudio 8-Bit was in charge of this show's creation and I must say, they did a good job in the visual department. It seems I'm lucky enough to only see the works of theirs that have CGI because theirs is actually not half bad. The Silhouette Knights do have choppy frame rates in episode 1 and there is a mecha dragon that suffers from bad CGI and frame rates too, and up close, most of these don't always look very good, but the coloring and way it's done here somewhat helps remedy that, and once the kinks are ironed out, they become fun to watch in battle, both in swarming an enemy or in one on one mech combat. Those sequences are insanely fast paced and done very well, especially when we see how they take advantage of the new equipment. They're based on knight armor so they definitely don't look as appealing or potentially iconic as say, a typical Gundam, but these designs are nice enough that I can see decent toy sales of them. Those swords look especially cool. The CGI demon beasts look even better, especially that giant beast that looks like a gigantic blue Avalugg. The giant magic rods don't look nearly as good, unfortunately. Still, the CGI, on the whole, is actually pretty decent, though most kept inconsistent and certainly not great.\n\nThe actual art is pretty nice too, not just for the characters (just look at the way they did Ernesti\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hair, that looks sick af) but especially for the magic. I especially love what they did with the eyes. The shading for the magic fire attacks looks splendid, really selling how much of a spectacle magic can be, even though it becomes a bit overused and therefore lose its luster. The animation is overall pretty decent too, even with a few minor errors like having one scene show 3 explosion dots towards the center and the moment afterwards having those dots much farther away, but it all looks good, especially coupled with the luckily very kinetic action. Sometimes we even see beasts in 2D and they look ok. Characters don't always blend well though, so that's a fault. Overall, this show looks nice. The reused animation is also very minor, so that's alright, I guess.\n\nThe music isn't as noteworthy, unfortunately. For one, I don't care for the OPs. I don't think they entirely fit the tone or setting here this series presents overall and they're ok at best songs on their own. The OST is pretty decent though. There are some decent if unmemorable tracks that often fit the scenarios well, especially in most of the action scenes.\n\nThe mecha battles were pretty fun for most part and so were the big battles against some of the demon beasts. This show's attitude towards mechs also greatly appealed to me. That being said, the crypt kind of annoyed me at times and on the whole, it wasn't as fun as it could've been thanks to that, especially in the final five episodes which left me woefully disappointed. I still had enough enjoyment with this one, more than I should have.\n\nThere are the makings of a good show here. Give it two cours and tidy up all the errors and the show would've been fine. I admire the spunk this show has and as a mecha nerd, this spoke to me somewhat, but it's inner workings are really on the fritz, like a loose Gunpla Kit. Shame since for a while, I probably would've recommended this series despite its faults but boy are they too many for me to safely recommend to anyone who isn't either highly interested in the concept of high fantasy crossing with mecha, a total mech nerd like myself, or really into overpowered protagonists. There are plenty of better mech shows with even better action, but this is at least one of the better Isekai shows I've seen, which speaks to the low quality of these kinds of shows. "}, {"id": 3376, "score": 30, "body": "Yukino Miyazawa is at the top of her class in both grades and respect. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the perfect model student\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 poised, generous, cultured, the picture of a school idol. But before you can start throwing around accusations of her being a Mary-Sue, she informs you very clearly that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all an act. She pretends to be perfect, working her little butt off to not only get good grades, but to make it look easy. Why? Because she loves receiving praise, and Japan has that whole \u00e2\u0080\u0098sempai\u00e2\u0080\u0099 thing going on.\n\nHer world is thrown into turmoil when a new student transfers into her class, named Soichiro Arima, and his good grades immediately bump her from her pedestal as the smartest kid in school. She declares him her rival, and he declares her\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 His love interest?\n\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot to talk about in regards to this series\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try to touch on most of it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But to start, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t restrain myself from gushing about the English dub, which is easily one of the best I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever heard. It consists mainly of some of the best and brightest stars of the nineties, and they all give four star performances. Yukino is a very talky character, whose inner monologues take up a disproportionate amount of the script, and this would be unbearable coming from anybody other than Veronica Taylor(Ash Ketchum, Amelia Wil Tesla Seyruun), who has a distinct habit of throwing herself wholeheartedly into every single role she performs. Her obsession over her grades and her budding relationship is every bit as convincing as her drive to become a Pokemon master ever was, and she never misses a beat on this project.\n\nChristopher Nicholas plays Soichiro just as flawlessly, hitting a wide range of emotions where most other actors would have just gone flat. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a damaged boy with very profound abandonment issues, and his motive for overachieving is entirely different from Yukino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, even though it has about an equally complex affect on his life. He does such a great job that I have to wonder why he only had six other anime roles aside from this one.\n\nSoichiro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s childhood friends consist of Hideaki Asaba\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Or Sexy Carlos, as AMV Hell 3 called him\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and Tsubasa Shibahime, who has an unrequited crush on Soichiro. Because of course she does. Hideaki is played by Liam O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Brien, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really think Dr. Tenma from monster needs me to tell you how great he is. He loves his lascivious ladies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 man character, and eats up every sleazy line he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s given. Lisa Ortiz, who voiced my favorite character of all time Lina Inverse, portrays Tsubasa, and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s able to command the screen even when her dialogue is reduced to growling. Which is a thing that happens. Rachel Lillis also has a handful of roles, and while they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not as diverse as her multiple roles in Pokemon, she still does a great job.\n\nThe other two of note are Yukino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s younger sisters, Kano and Tsukino, but the only really big part they play in the story is the fact that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s their job to dole out plot summaries at the beginning of most episodes, and the preview at the end of every episode. And who did they cast for these roles? Megan Hollingshead (Officer Jenny, Nurse joy, the Sonozaki Twins) and Jessica Calvello (Excel!). While either of these actors are phenomenal on their own, they work even better together, feeding off of each others\u00e2\u0080\u0099 already boisterous energy.\n\nBy the way, i\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to go briefly off topic to say how awesome it is to have Calvello returning to voice acting. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already done a few recent roles for Sentai filmworks, and even some Cyanide and Happiness clips, and now she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be in Attack on Titan! Glad to have you back, and I mean it!\n\nSince this series was produced directly after Evangelion, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be any surprise that it had an abysmally small animation budget to work with. But that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never the death knell of any anime\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Any show can look fantastic even with the barest of budgets. And since Kare Kano is a slow paced and text-heavy romantic comedy, it should have been easy to cut corners wherever possible without really upsetting anybody.\n\nBut since this is late nineties Studio Gainax, the order of the day seems to have been \u00e2\u0080\u0098make it look like the last few episodes of Evangelion.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Much like he did in Eva, Director Hideaki Anno overcompensates for the lack of animation money by employing hyper, eclectic visual style that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meant to distract us, like dangling keys in front of a baby. this is a huge pet peeve of mine, and until now, I always assumed that Bakemonogatari was the worst offender. The art direction is largely directionless, as the breakneck editing frequently jumps from style to style. When we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not watching the lifeless key frames of the actual material, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking at art-class charcoal sketches, monochromatic manga images, and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I swear I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not making this up\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Actual cardboard cut-outs on popsicle sticks, all in a hilarious attempt to distract us from what little visual flare the soft, pastel-clad series has to offer. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no OTHER reason for such a slow paced anime to do this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Oh, wait, yes there is.\n\nIn order to talk about the writing that went into Kare Kano, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to have to start by explaining the concept of Show Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Tell. Well, a condensed explanation is in order, as it pertains to a visual medium. Basically, telling the viewer about something isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to give them the same experience as showing it to them. If a feeling or emotion can be stated with a simple change of expression, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no reason to have the character blab on about it. For example, my biggest problem with Kick-Ass 2 was that the admittedly bold character development was explored through long-winded emotional speeches, rather than actual actions. Show, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell.\n\nUnfortunately, Kare Kano is an extremely \u00e2\u0080\u0098telly\u00e2\u0080\u0099 series. Every single plot point is stated to us, sometimes over and over again, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not just talking about the plot recaps. The voice-over narrations between our two heroes are incessant, as they beat us over the head with every thought, concern, or emotion that may be going through their minds. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re constantly reminded about things that we couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have possibly forgotten, and no matter who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talking, they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shut up about Yukino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personality, whether real or constructed, or about the fact that her and Shoichiro are changing each other. A good cast can go a long way, but this amount of expositional soliloquizing wears out it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s welcome fast. And don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even get me started on the constant\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And I mean constant\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 On-screen text.\n\nBasically, it has the pretentious writing style of Evangelion, and the heavily randomized viaual style of FLCL, and that wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be such a bad thing if it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slow pace and limbo-champ stakes.\n\nWhich is unfortunate, because when the show actually shuts the hell up for two minutes and develops the characters normally, it can deliver some heart-stoppingly beautiful moments. But they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re few and far between.\n\nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big spoiler to say that our two leads become a couple, since this is a romantic comedy, but the surprising factor is just how fast they get together. Instead of relying on the cliched will-they-won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t-they dynamic, Kare Kano isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a story about them getting together as much as it is about them staying together. And that would make for a really interesting plot, if there was any actual threat to them. Yes, the characters themselves may not be annoyingly perfect, but their relationship damn well IS. Every conflict they ever face\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And I hate using hyperbole, so no, I am not exaggerating about this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Is resolved as quickly and easily as possible, before being instantly forgotten. Even the characters that try to get in their way are defeated, befriended, and robbed of any future identity or screen time.\n\nUnfortunately for Kare Kano, my other big pet peeve is when a series spends an entire episode\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Or two\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 On one character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arc, giving them development or a backstory just to drop them out of the story immediately afterwards. When that character is going to be killed off, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one thing, but when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to lose all of their dialogue and literally act like a monkey for the rest of the show, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something else. And not something good.\n\nSometimes, even the events revolving specifically around our couple ultimately result in nothing. Here, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give you a spoiler-example. Soichiro was abandoned by his deadbeat father and physically abusive mother as a child. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s raised by his aunt and uncle, and at one point in the series, we travel with him to his family reunion. And because of some betrayal his father committed, everybody hates him, saying he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll amount to nothing. You may be saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cWait, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he at the top of his class?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Yes, and his uncle brings up that exact point, telling all of them that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re feelings toward him make no sense. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where that storyline ends.\n\nIf having a character point out that something didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make sense was enough to make up for the fact that it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make sense, I would have enjoyed Angel Beats a bit more.\n\nNow, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the part where I put my money where my mouth is; That entire plot point could have been easily improved. Rather than openly hating him for something he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deserve, why not have them secretly hate him, but wear fake smiles around him and pretend to love him BECAUSE of his grades? Then when they find out that his grades slipped because of his girlfriend, their true natures show! See, by doing that, they could have tied this conflict directly into the main plot. His relationship to Yukino could have been dragged into it, kicking and screaming if necessary.\n\nTo address the elephant in the room, a lot of people consider this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s damning flaw to be the fact that it suddenly ended at episode 26, leaving off without any sort of conclusion. This was done because the manga author, Masami Tsuda, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like the direction the adaptation was taking. She said that Anno was focusing more on the comedy than the main romance, and as such, she refused to let them adapt her work any further. Personally, I think it was unfair and entirely inaccurate of her to imply that this show was moving in some sort of direction in the first place. But yes, I have to side with her on this. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m actually glad she cut them off, because in addition to protecting her own name, she prevented Anno from embarrassing himself any further.\n\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a long list of shows that were inspired in some way or another by this particular series, including one of my first positive reviews, Yamada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s First Time. The problem? Almost all of these shows are decisively better than Kare Kano.\n\nFor those of you who decided to TLDR by skipping right to my final thoughts, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d hate to disappoint you, so here they are. Kare Kano is a train wreck. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry, I know it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s popular, and a lot of people love it, but I have to be honest; This is one of the most badly written and poorly executed pieces of work that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen. It showed some promise in the beginning, but even then, the cracks in the writing were already beginning to show. My expectations may have been a little too high, but even if they weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, my opinion of this show would still be the same. I thought it would be the best anime I reviewed this month, but no, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the worst. At least This Ugly Yet Beautiful World put forth some actual effort, making a genuine attempt to have a decent story and a consistent plot.\n\nI give His and Her Circumstances a 3/10. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pleasantly intrigued by the idea of watching a circle of talking heads play Uno for three minutes, go ahead and raise it to a 5/10, as no other show will be lazy enough to deliver on that particular joy of yours."}, {"id": 3378, "score": 20, "body": "Being the new kid in school can be a challenge\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even worse when every single student and teacher on campus is convinced that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll beat them up for minor offenses. This is the boat Kodaka Hasegawa finds himself in when his entire class sees him stumble over his feet in front of them, and automatically assumes he was trying to assault the teacher. Feared and avoided, the already timid teen seems doomed to never make any friends\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Until he walks in on one of his quieter classmates having a lively conversation with her invisible friend.\n\nTheir conversation convinces her to create her own club for the sole purpose of helping people make friends, and Kodaka is her first member, whether he likes it or not. Soon enough, their club attracts a bunch of other socially awkward kids from around the school, all of whom possess their own special forms of insanity, and all of whom have a big heaping helping of puppy love for Kodaka. Will these lonesome losers be able to teach each other how to make friends with their fellow students, or will they realize that the best friends they could ever ask for were right under their noses the entire time?\n\nHaganai was produced by AIC Build, a company that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been around since the mid eighties, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been more or less active ever since, pumping out some very diverse and varied titles. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult to find a common thread between them, but it would appear that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been very astute about keeping with the styles of the times\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Their newer work like this and Kotoura-san looks nothing like their earlier work, like Battle Athletes Victory and several Tenchi titles. I talked about them before in my Oreimo review, and my comments from back then still hold up\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, some of them do.\n\nOn the plus side, the series looks great. The character designs are inspired, with very unique and attractive appearances for each character. The bright color palette that was applied to them contrasts beautifully with the darker, more realistic looking settings they often appear in. The animation, on the other hand, is a little on the dull side. Static shots of the characters talking to each other is only ever broken up by repetitive panning shots, and only the smallest bursts of movement seem to have been deemed worthy of being truly animated. The use of lighting is thoughtful and does tend to make up for it at times, but that trick gets old pretty fast.\n\nWell, to be more accurate, the animation budget appears to have been allocated towards all of the fanservice scenes, and boy are there a lot of them. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one character who has breasts that are roughly the size of watermelons, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be willing to bet that two thirds of the budget went towards showing off these giant honkers, whether it means putting her in a skimpy outfit when she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s playing a fantasy video game, jiggling them around in a swimsuit, or just jiggling them around in general. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transparent as all hell, but at least the animation doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look bad as a result\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 No, bland animation and generic settings aside, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pretty easy-on-the-eye series.\n\nThe music is your standard fare for this kind of show, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also not really a bad thing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It does a serviceable enough job, even if it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feature any stand-outs and isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very memorable. The opening and closing, on the other hand, are SO AWESOME. The opening, Zannenkei Rinjinbu by Tomodachi Tsukuritai, is fast, catchy, and features some intense orchestration with a fast-paced and well-animated video to go with it. The closing, Watashi no Ki-Mo-Chi by Maria Inoue, is pure rock and roll. The video features the two main female characters rocking out on guitar while cloaked in shadows, which\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not gonna lie\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t skip once.\n\nThe English dub is yet another Jamie Marchi effort, which of course means I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to spend the entire experience face-palming from all the lame faux teen dialogue and repeated phrases, right? Well, no. This is actually one of the better dubs she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s written. It had a few hiccups in the beginning, with her two favorite terms (totes and what the crap?) shoved into the first episode within a single minute of each other, but from there on, the teen slang she uses never really feels false or out of place\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The only real problem I had with it is the \u00e2\u0080\u009cClever\u00e2\u0080\u009d little joke she made twice about the main character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hair color.\n\nSee, in Japan, blondness is a stereotypical sign of non-conformity, as it means someone is either a foreigner who doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand societal norms, or a delinquent who just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care. Kodoka is perceived by his classmates as both, so his hair color was obviously a deliberate detail that was added in during his design process\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But Jamie Marchi still manages to slip in two jokes about his blondness meaning he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an airhead. Not only is that an American thing, but in neither case is it actually called for in the script. But even with one glaring mistake like that one, the acting is still pretty good.\n\nTo be fair, Jerry Jewel does sound like he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s phoning it in with the lead role, but I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say I blame the guy\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 After the first episode ends, his character just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that interesting. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say other actors couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have put forth a much more interesting performance, but for what we got, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not bad. Whitney Rodgers in the role of Yozora is cruel, sarcastic, diabolical, and plays the character as though she genuinely empathized with her. Jad Saxton is haughty, manic and insecure as the boisterous Sena, and her particular high pitched nasally voice projects her frantic whining perfectly. Alexis Tipton goes balls-out insane with Rika\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perverted ranting, doing a very impressive job with material that a lot of actresses probably wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have been comfortable with. Alison Viktorin does okay, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard her do much better in other roles.\n\nSlice of Life and Harem are two of the most heavily maligned genres in anime history. The former is known for being boring and by the numbers, while the latter is largely known for being misogynistic self-insert cheesecake. They used to be, for the most part, two separate genres. There were some blends, but they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really become a common thing until the concept of the \u00e2\u0080\u0098misfit school club\u00e2\u0080\u0099 anime was invented and largely popularized by a certain god girl and her brigade. With that innovation came the perfect excuse to gather a group of color-coded school girls and examine their daily lives in a small communal setting. Oh, and occasionally, there would be one male character among them to become the object of their affections while taking the high road at every possible opportunity.\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pathetic and transparent, but it made production of such titles a lot easier, as slice of life titles had some extra flavor that they rarely had before, and harem titles were no longer solely dependent on coming up with new plots to set themselves against. Now, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say this formula can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be done right\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 As long as the product is well written, funny, and brings something new to the table, a slice of life harem series can easily become more than the sum of its parts\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Just look at Ouran High School Host Club and Oreshura as prime examples of this.\n\nSo what does Haganai bring to the table? Well, it brings a very interesting set-up, with it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two downtrodden main characters having depressed, cynical attitudes towards school and other people, yet making the effort to rise above it and develop social lives anyway. Their first club member is a bubbly popular girl who wants their help making genuine friends who aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just after her for their own benefit, and her upbeat attitude clashes instantly with Yozora\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more pessimistic outlook. Now, this set-up is a very promising one, and offers a lot of potential for depth, complexity and character development as these three very different people bounce off of and challenge each other through their many differences. It could have been a truly great dramedy.\n\nUnfortunately, this intriguing dynamic is thrown out with the burnable trash as the show is taken over by shallow new characters and ridiculous situations that seem to have been conceived for the sole purpose of putting the female characters in skimpy outfits and baiting them into different kinds of male-driven otaku porn, which they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll watch, play, and adamantly defend. We get the beach episode, we get the pool episode, we get a bunch of token harem characters, and by the time Kodaka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 13 year old little sister bursts onto the screen naked as the day she was born for the first of this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s many nude scenes, it should have been clear to everyone watching that any hint of depth there may have been in the beginning was nothing more than insincere ennui, which was intended\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 With help from the darker, bleak aesthetic of the series\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 To make the characters seem more intellectual and edgy than similar characters in other harem shows.\n\nAnd no, there is nothing smart or substantial about this series, even when you compare it to other titles in the school club/harem genre. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s yet another twelve episode commercial for body pillows. But that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what the genre is, right? You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t criticize a harem for being a harem any more than you can criticize porn for being porn, right? Well, even putting aside the achievements of the few good titles out there, Haganai still has one problem that sets it apart from any other harem that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Or better yet, and other anime that I can think of on the spot. Haganai might be the only anime I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen that pretends to have had effort put into it. It actually pretends to try.\n\nGenerally speaking, no harem show really has to put much effort into writing their characters. They fit into pre-set categories, and you can pretty much write them with a checklist in the other hand. Haganai takes this a step farther by stealing it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s characters wholesale from other anime, and then rewriting those characters just enough to make them legally original. Here, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s do a brief run-down of the cast of this show.\n\nThe main character is a good natured boy who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great cook, but he gets mistaken for a punk due to his looks and an unfortunate misunderstanding. He has a name, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d do just fine calling him Ryouji from Toradora. He meets the first member of his harem when he walks in on her doing something embarrassing in an empty classroom(because of course he does), and she winds up being a loner weirdo who can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make friends because she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to join any clubs. Her conversation with him inspires her to start her own club, where she treats her members more as commodities than friends\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Oh, and by the way, they knew each other a long time ago. You can file her right under the long list of Haruhi Suzumiya clones.\n\nTheir next member is Sena, a popular girl with great grades who tries way too hard to be the best at everything and is in desperate need of genuine friends, and she immediately enters into a cat-and-dog relationship with the main girl. She was obviously intended to be a clone of Ami from Toradora, but Ami was never this annoying. Yukimura is an effeminate boy who has a complex about looking like a girl, so he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basically Hideyoshi from Baka and Test\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Except that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in love with Kodaka, so he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more like Ruka from Steins;Gate. Rika is the socially exempt scientist who is sex crazed, overly forward, and acts like a perverted old man. Think Washu from Tenchi for this one. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little girl who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so obviously supposed to be Index, and oh yeah, Kodaka has a precocious little sister who is in love with him and dresses in very otaku friendly cosplays, so she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty much every generic incest/pedophile fantasy ever invented.\n\nIn other words, there is not one original idea in this entire series. Even the one good plot line it has was adapted and repackaged from better stories like Haruhi Suzumiya and the Love Hina manga. The set-ups, which seemed pretty meaty at first, ultimately lead to nothing more than tired harem elements and aimless pandering that accomplishes exactly what it tries: nothing. Which is a shame, because these set-ups really did have a lot of potential, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not just saying that in an empty way.\n\nSo, since I have such a great record of putting my money where my mouth it, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a list of some of the opportunities that Haganai missed by leaning back on the notoriously low harem standards.. Yozora could have forced her club to interact with other clubs, only to unintentionally alienate them even farther with hilarious results. Sena\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sudden nosedive into video game addiction could have come into conflict with her studying habits, making her grades suffer as a result. Speaking of Sena, she could have used her popularity and influence to show the student body that Kodaka isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really as bad a person as they think he is(Seriously, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to steal an idea from Toradora, you might as well go all the way with it). Hell, maybe if Sena\u00e2\u0080\u0099s giant boobs hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t permanently damaged her backbone, she could stand up to Yozora instead of running away, calling her out on the fact that she wants to make friends, but is a complete bitch to anybody who comes close to her.\n\nAre those ideas great? Maybe not. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not a professional writer. I write fanfics occasionally, but if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re being completely honest, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not very good. But I have 100 percent confidence that the scenarios I just cooked up are better than the ones Haganai comes up with. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bet anything they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be more interesting than watching Yozora intimidate a 10 year old girl by threatening to make revenge porn of her, or having Sena\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dad get drunk and hit on Kodaka, or having the entire female cast act like mewling, manipulative, infantile idiots who bicker with each other for literally no reason other than a continuous feud that started over nothing and escalated over nothing. They beat the hell out of seeing the cast play a virtual reality game that somehow knows exactly what they look like in real life.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll admit, though, Haganai does have it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moments. The feud between Yozora and Sena, while annoying and pointless and at one point even a little rapey(beach episode), was funny at times. Yozora\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history with Kodaka is also really interesting, at least in the very small amount of screen time it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s given. But aside from that, the only way I could make this experience less painful was by pretending that the Neighbors club didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really exist\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 That Kodaka was just a lonely boy in an empty room imagining that he had a harem of hot girls at his beck and call. He based a few of them on girls he knew, and based the rest off of anime and games he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d enjoyed. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why none of them ever act like real people\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 He doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how real girls act!\n\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always rejecting or ignoring their advances\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Because while having them want him helps his fragile ego, he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be known as the guy who fools around with invisible people. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why these girls are so interested in porno and video games\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Because he wants to be able to relate to them, so he gave them the same hobbies and interests that he has! It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not as terrible a show as it looks, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a deep character study about a delusional porn game addict! Yes, I know this theory doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hold up. Yes, I know it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s BS. But you know what? I had to try really hard to enjoy this turd muffin, and that BS is the only weapon I had at my disposal, so back off!\n\nHaganai: I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have many friends is available from Funimation. You can find it in a Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack for between thirty and forty dollars. You can also find the second season for exactly the same. There have been several written iterations of the series, and while the original light novels have not yet been translated into English or released in America, a few of the manga series have been released stateside by Seven Seas entertainment. Netflix does not carry it, but Funimation does, although you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to pay to see beyond episode 2. The second season doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really improve upon any of my complaints, aside from the fact that all of the nudity is gone, which is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Kind of missing the point.\n\nAt first glance, Haganai looks like it has the potential to become more than the sum of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parts, both as a harem series and just as a series in general. Well, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what it wants you to think, with it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye-catching aesthetic and cynical tone. By not following through on any of this potential, it falls far below the sum of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parts, offering the same damn cheesecake garbage we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen a million times before. I might be able to forgive it for that if it hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been so pretentious in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presentation, and had just decided to have fun with itself like any ecchi show should do\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, which lowers my opinion of it right back down to the level of all those other pandering titty-fest shows that it should be at least technically superior to. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lazy, unoriginal; and just flat out not worth the effort. I give Haganai a 2/10.  "}, {"id": 3390, "score": 15, "body": "\"If the best thing I can say about your show is that the girls are hot, then your show is terrible!\" -some lazy jackass\n\n*Spoilers for Akashic Records*\n\nBefore I start the review proper, or rather, this dissertation about why this show is a generic and irritating fraud that actually manages to squander any potential it had for some lazy comedy and infuriating LN bullshit clich\u00c3\u00a9s, I have two things I feel I must notify you of. First, a decent chunk of this review will be spent analyzing the ideas this series had and how with some major and minor tweaks, the series could've been better, at least from a storytelling perspective. Secondly, I'm about to let out something I have to get out of my chest because while this insufferable mentality I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m about to describe isn't truly widespread, I've still seen it a handful of times, and quite frankly, it's sickening. People who have this upcoming mentality infuriate me with their ignorance and sheer vindictiveness.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf a title is almost nothing but recycled content from shows prior, then to me at least, it has no excuse and little reason to both exist and be defended as a work of fiction. It seems like creativity isn't as valued as it should be and this has been a problem in every industry at almost every point in history for one reason or another. With the anime in the 80's/90's, it was schlock bloodbath OVAs and nowadays in anime, it's Light Novel School Battle and/or Harem anime. Titles that largely or even entirely fit these descriptions can still break the mold and achieve something greater.\n\nWe do not have some \"mythical, absurdly high, nigh-unachievable standard\" these assholes keep accusing us of having! I'm sick of ignorant pricks assuming that we do! We just want anime to actually have a sense of life, a sense of passion, and a reason to exist outside of making corporate money from people who have loved tons of shows borderline identical to what they're currently watching and fapping to. Even among school battle (usually harem) anime, there are some that go above and beyond, like the aforementioned Chivalry of a Failed Knight. In fact, even among the standards if these \"copy-paste\" anime, some manage to really sink below to almost creative levels of suck, like The Irregular at Magic High School, as if to prove that there is a standard to hold titles like this by and that even this kind of anime has its own hierarchy like all the rest.\n\nIn summation, we do not all have some absurd standard for anime, we just want these kinds of titles to die out (or rather to not be as widespread, which in fairness, is already happening somewhat over the past year) so that anime that actually have passion and creativity can more easily flourish, and even by the standards of the now incessant LN school battle harem anime, some can go beyond the expectations or fail to even meet such bottom of the barrel standards. If you enjoy these titles, that's fine, just at least have some standards regarding these things since not all of them are of equal quality and the ones with the least amount of effort put into making them worthwhile works of fiction do not deserve to be defended, at least to me. Again, like them if you want, just don't accuse us of bad standards or incorrect views since we dissented from your \"it's done before but that's fine because I like it\" viewpoint. Before we start, let me state that this mentality pisses me off about as bad as this show did, hence why my tone will sound insanely aggressive throughout, since, well, this show was offensively bad. Leave now if you're not ok with kind of atmosphere and tone, and/or if you're not ok with me bashing the show (assuming you didn't leave by that point since I'm showing it absolutely no mercy). With that tirade out of the way, let's start the review proper.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMixing Konosuba humor and Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei is like mixing a liter of ghost pepper juice and white paint. You know, shit like this is why I invested in a tomato farm. Wait, I'm sorry, was that joke not predictable enough for you? My bad, let me try again: Ahem, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis show is cancer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Actually, my previous joke was funnier than both this one and every single joke here in this godforsaken show. Let me grab those tomatoes now.\n\nAkashic Records. For some reason, people thought this was actually funny and \u00e2\u0080\u009ctotally not exactly like all of the other trash we hate because it has more comedy in its trashiest scenarios than those others shows that do the exact same thing but with a permanently straight face.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This show isn't funny; it's predictable. It has no semblance of tact or actual self-awareness on how awful its writing and gaudy cheese-fest self-justification for subsequent action exposition dumps that last up to a minute are. You people call SAO terrible? At least it has more tact and worthwhile humor than this show ever did, as well as more originality, better music, a much more tolerable color pallet. Even with its bad pacing, at least it never showed off early events that feel like they should be coming in much later than they should, or give flashbacks to equally terrible and popular shows with specific plot points. This show thinks it can get away with being the trashiest LN garbage ever as long as it adds \u00e2\u0080\u009churr-de-durr\u00e2\u0080\u009d to everything and adding a funny face just to really make it even more obvious than it is. It thinks it's the Konosuba of school battle harem trash; it's not. It takes itself just as seriously for most part, so that doesn't work. Hell, it's even worse since those shows take horrible scenarios like attempted rape seriously when presenting them. This show doesn't. But enough rambling; what makes Akashic Records so awful to the point where I actually believe that The Asterisk War is a much better show than it? Well, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s find out, shall we?\n\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s address the elephant in the room before we really rip into the logic of this show: the female school uniforms. You know, I think it should be the woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choice as to whether or not she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be so scantily clad that not only are her midriffs and things exposed, but that she also has suspenders at the thighs and waist to make sure that two-piece outfit doesn't fall apart, not something that a school, let alone an \u00e2\u0080\u009cesteemed private academy\u00e2\u0080\u009d such as this one, should mandate. This kind of uniform that would make any real school principal revile in horror is, while sexy and appealing, downright disgusting in the fact that a school mandates women wear that as their official uniform. I get that this is a trash anime, but no successful school in their right mind would pull such a stunt without raising absolute hellfire from parents, true gentlemen, feminists, other schools and districts, and SJWs across the nation, especially when this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one obviously hot and fanservicey character is more decently clad than the high school students (aka, generic archetype bitches) that are forced to wear this. I mean, the men wear regal and classy suits befitting of gentlemen (even Glenn wears something of decent clothing, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the lazy asshole pervert), so wouldn't it make sense to have the ladies wear something even more regal and classy, like Celica, the obviously hot fanservice character? You wouldn't believe how badly that made me lose hope in any logic found in the story. I mean, I am a teenage, straight male, and I like hot women like the rest of my kind, hell, I can ogle at Celica all day, but this is just ridiculous!Now, to everything else.\n\nTo be fair, the series doesn't really have major plot holes, even despite a few minor ones (nor all of which I'll cover), but it does have many leaps in logic for the characters, bad pacing, and it manages to portray certain scenes horrendously. But there are decent moments, like the rare joke that hits, occasional (if not successful due to poor pacing) attempts at emotional scenes, and the scene where Glenn goes Grammar Nazi on students to show just how convoluted magic can really be. I'll start by going rapid fire on a few dumb things from episodes 1 and 2. Still, prepare to be here a while, the story segment takes up a vast majority of the review since there is a lot I need to say here.\n\nWhy does Celica threaten Glenn to get him to work at this school despite knowing that he is beyond unqualified and that he hates magic? Is it because she just wants him to get a job and if he a deadbeat regardless of whether or not he is remotely qualified, because if so, that's stupid (since she needs to make sure he is at least remotely qualified for his job). The series checks out one important trite bullshit (aka bad clich\u00c3\u00a9) from the list really early with a scene where the flatter student (Sistine) helped the big-tits student (Rumia), but here, it's portrayed in such a sexual manner to the point where in other series, they are still sexual harassment despite teasing, this is easily a more blatantly disgusting and uncomfortable act of sexual harassment that sent out of its way to be as horrid as possible (partially since it made me hate the Sistine, one of the main characters, by the first episode, the episode where we are supposed to be sold on these characters). \n\nThe entirety of episode 2 felt like it should've been stretched out over multiple episodes given how here is a small time skip in the middle of episode 2 after Glenn reaches the importance of grammar in changing magic, and how much is packed into this episode story-wise. In order of appearance: Glenn starts the episode same as before, he goes so far into dissing magic that Sistine slaps him and leaves in tears, each character has an emotional moment before Glenn realizes how little students truly know about magic besides one particular method for each spell, he schools them, then his students like him, he has then made progress and is now infinitely more passionate about work, we go back and reaffirm that there is a moment in which Rumia was saved by presumably Glenn (we even see the hair color, and in episode 1, she looks familiar to him, but this isn't spaced or enough to feel organic or that it would take a little while for us to really explore this point without coming up with the answer so early into the show), and then terrorists. All of this should've been episodes 3, 4, and even 5. I mean it. We could've just done the same shenanigans and have episode 2 end on the moment where Sistine slaps Glenn and walks off in tears, then episode 3 have an emotional episode that shows us another side of our (at the time) 3 important characters while showing us that terrorists are soon to some before at the end, he busts out some knowledge on the students, then episode 4 not only shows us how much all of this is working out while at the same time showing us that he is actually becoming happier overall while doing this, but then the episode brings us back to that moment where we see him and Rumia interact before we learn that she was saved by someone who looks suspiciously like Glenn, and then it ends on terrorists moving in. Episodes 5 and 6 would be a bunch of terrorists raising hell in the school and then Glenn, and all students and teachers fight back in a mini war arc, by editing the final few minutes of episode 2 where terrorists show up and turning that into episode 5, and editing some of the intrusive comedy of episode 3 and making it episode 6.. There, I just vastly improved the show just by taking episode 2 stretching it out, and adding and editing parts as I went along,like making episode 3 episode 6. If only the writer was this capable.\n\nThe moment that made this show awful beyond redemption was the attempted rape scene. Let me set the scene. Terrorists have just captured Rumia who turned out to be a former princess but her family was killed and she escaped (hence why she said she was saved by someone before terrorists would've killed her). Sistine is alone in a room, and a terrorist walks in. He then begins to toy with her, saying that people like her are surprisingly and deliciously fragile while pinning her down and slowly undressing her. Then, Glenn walks in and it turns from trite to actively offensively terrible. In the midst of a scene of attempted rape, Glenn walks in, pays no mind, and lackadaisical comedy ensues for like 40 seconds! WHAT THE FLYING FUCK IS THIS SHIT?!?! A character is in the verge of getting rape, and the supposed \u00e2\u0080\u009chero\u00e2\u0080\u009d who busts in not only doesn't recognize the situation, but acts all lazy! Needless to say, this moment made this show practically impossible to redeem. When SAO can treat this kind of scene with infinitely more tact than this show can, in regards to content and tone, you know we have a problem here! Sure, eventually Glenn saves her, but then we get the rest of the scene. \n\nGlenn busts out this arcana card which nullifies all magic (especially opponents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and enemies\u00e2\u0080\u009d magic). This is a very generic magic for an MC to have, and it's giving me Mahouka flashbacks as if the school terrorism thing didn't do that already. Glenn just busts out an arcana card unceremoniously and explains what it does in his usual lackadaisical tone (tired of me using that word yet?). This is the first time we see this kind of magic card in the series, adding to the already surpassingly convoluted magic system of this world, so at least the show could do is unveil it with grandeur. Even Mahouka did that right! Whatever, a badly animated curb stomp commences in which Glenn wins, and episode 2 ends. As you can no doubt tell, the rape attempt scene should've never happened and in my version above, it never would.\n\nActually, there are a few things in episode 3 I would alter, since it's not a great episode either (I mean, what did you expect from this show). I think the worst thing this episode does is prove that this crock of shit had potential, potential that it, predictably, squandered. I mean, Glenn was a mate killer, so that could've been explored and built up a bit better since before then, the only buildup was him saying magic kills people. In this episode, I would edit out the numerous and always monotonous self-justification for what someone is about to do exposition dumps there always last for around 30 seconds, some of the intrusive comedy of the first 6 minutes, and do one last crucial thing in the last few minutes of the episode. Remember how Professor Huey apparently left (hence why they have a sub) prior to the events of episode 1? Well, here he is again, but has no exposed motivations for being here, and he just stands there, saying that it's a game to see if Glenn can free Rumia from a bunch of magic circles, so, none of that makes any real sense. He needs a reason for doing this, and why he is treating this like a game. Also, at the end, they completely gloss over what Rumia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true name as princess was Eruminia, and I don't know why. This also confirms that yes, Glenn was the one that unknowingly saved her. It's a shame that one of the most potentially interesting hook questions about the series was dealt with only 3 episodes in out of 12.\n\nI'm not going to go or if my way to really break down the rest of the episodes since that would take fucking forever and I'm already spending a lot of time doing rapid fire on a few problems per episode while fixing the series as a whole. But now, we reach the tournament arc, starting with episode 4, so time for me to keep doing what I've been doing. The queen is still the mother of Rumia but apparently everyone was killed but her. Why did she pronounce her daughter dead after the terrorists came? What actually happened? Did terrorists simply kidnap her from everyone? Has the school heard nothing about the Queen? What about the dad/king? \n\nThe other thing is that we are suddenly introduced to what all of the students can do during the beginning of this tournament arc via a pep talk from Glenn. Want to know how to have made this moment work. Have it so that when the terrorists showed up, they all do what we would hear them being capable of, that what this moment would be actually gratifying since by then we would've known a bit about all the students and then have epic realization that Glenn was exactly right since that what they did in that hypothetical. This has been another round of me improving the series. In fact, the actual tournament section in episode 4 could've been 2, maybe even 3 whole episodes in order to make an interesting tournament arc up until the next episode (specifically, 7-9 on my version), since there are so many games that are glossed over since most students are not important. Hell, even before that, we saw a typical asshole vs underdog rivalry set up with Harley and his class vs Glenn and his, and then it would be gratifying and exciting to see both groups compete and Glenn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s class do well on each of these events. This has been another round of me making a better series out of the pieces this one failed to put together. Also, the asspull of Rumia winning her round because the big buff guy suddenly blacked out for no reason was infuriating, and the fact that it came after a rushed and stupid bit of her teammates telling her to quit since they \u00e2\u0080\u009ccare for her\u00e2\u0080\u009d despite her being in no peril and her wanting to do this, is especially galling. When both The Asterisk War and Fairy Tail can make a better tournament arc, then your arc is shit, and by extension, you're shit!\n\nEpisodes 5 and 6, barring a few really dumb moments (as per usual), are probably the best in the series, as little as that says about them. The comedy is still pretty miss for me but not only are there a few genuinely sweet moments like Glenn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conversation with Rumia I episode 5 and her true reunion with her mother at the end of episode 6, but also, the way Glenn defeats the villain of this arc is actually pretty intelligent and entertaining, reminding me of some of the most popular protagonists in anime like Lelouch from Code Geass, Light from Death Note, and Sora from No Game No Life. Still, time to fix \u00e2\u0080\u0098em. I'll give this series a compliment when it deserves one; it's already like...96:0 in problems (and you get a cookie if you get where that reference came from). The way to make it better this time is simple, and it builds from the last fixing I did: actually juggle the rescue attempt and the tournament matches equally and flesh them both out, that way we have all of the emotional payoffs actually pay off (at least if you give each scene enough space), and so that we can actually enjoy the tournament side of the arc, and have that whole thing from episodes 5 and 6 take up 3 more episodes (10-12 in my version) while removing some of the fake out comedy, taking away the explosion speeches about \u00e2\u0080\u009cme saying why I'm doing what I'm doing\u00e2\u0080\u009d, removing the dere moments Sistine has with her teacher (I get that he is 19 but still it's sorta creepy for a student to have a hunted romantic interest in her teacher) and altering the ending where the students spend all his money to him actually treating them with some of his money, that way nothing about any of the arcs each character went through get cheapened upon rewatch and hindsight (namely Glenn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s). Also, have more animation in the arc since this series doesn't really have much actual character animation. \n\nSee? It's simple. If we create a brand new episode 1 from scratch to replace this episode 1 and take all of the ideas I brought up that modify these episodes, we could've had an actually good series on our hands since despite all of the LN trope bullshit, awful comedy moments that ruin certain scenes, and a few other things, all the pieces were there for the first 6 episodes to be a good 1 cour series. The other 6 on the other hand...yeah, I haven't been really living up to my promise of tone, and these episodes are gonna change that; they are that bad...\n\n*sigh* Episode 7 is where things go back to being abysmal instead of just bad, partially due to almost half of it being a clich\u00c3\u00a9 beach episode and the irritating comedy, partially due to the character Re=L (make your Ergo Proxy joke elsewhere). She is such a bad character, and it is the impetus of the arc and why it's horrible. Her heel turn is insanely telegraphed and still incredibly forced, being out of jealously in episode 7 about the fact that the deuteragonist females are quote unquote \u00e2\u0080\u009cstealing Glenn away from her\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and because she is just a double agent who likes her dead brother who she saw again (which means he was revived, which is a major plot point in the arc, revival) in episode 8, while the rest of episode 8 before that is just the introduction of revival, one of the villains of the previous arc showing up and being a crazy bitch, and Re=L moving around and being an insufferable bitch. Fuck this arc in its entirety. Oh, and she nearly kills Glenn because of this and badly injures Rumia. When you consider that up to this point, she had been trying to kill Glenn (or at least she attacks him as greeting and always wants to settle a score with him) and the fact that she genuinely talked of the fact that she had a lot of fun with the people she immediately afterwards hated) and the fact that she had just been a generic deadpan loli character, this sudden turn is infuriatingly stupid and forced. The 9th episode is just as bad honestly, and they rushed the shit out of a villain death and the backstory Re=L has can't redeem her in the slightest. Also, the main blue-haired villain of the arc was wasted in the fact that there is a malicious character named Reiner, but this guy was just some random who wasn't connected with anything and is just a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbad person who does bad things because villain\u00e2\u0080\u009d character. I literally have no way to really remotely fix this arc; it was dead on arrival.\n\nBut now, we finally reach the final arc. It is one of the stupidest story arcs I have ever seen in my life, if not the absolute dumbest and most wince-worthy of them all. Here is the main plot of arc 4: Some creepy teacher guy continually confesses to Sistine and after Glenn overheard him dissing her dream, he puts on this front about wanting to marry her for money, and it all becomes a pissing match, except between teachers over a student. Fucking creepy! It's beyond stupid a premise given the age ranges (adult and teenager), and given how this is the impetus on having another evil protagonist bent on using Rumia for some scheme, you'd think this wouldn't exist and that they'd find a less disgusting way for this to happen. The sub plot is about Glenn suddenly realizing that Sistine looks like Sera, a now dead girl he once loved before he left the Imperial Corps, and that now angel dusts addicts (I wish they meant the real life Angel Dust drug) are dying, even a year after that substance was said to have been eradicated. All of these have no right of intertwining with the main (disgusting and wince-worthy) plot of the arc. Also, Re=L is off scot free after the betrayal (did she not ever get arrested for treason for that whole thing in the previous arc?), just to add on to what an irredeemable crock of shit this final arc is! Then, the finale. Oh boy. It's probably the most generic episode in the entire show. Turns of there was another traitor that posed as Leo's after he killed him part-way into episode 11, and the only thing resolved is the immediately inserted grudge match between the two. I don't even have the energy to go into any depth with this one, it's just generic and bleh, as if the show is not even trying to hide it's true colors anymore. Serves it right.\n\nYou know, if the narrative wasn't so shit in the way that it was, Glenn might have been an actually good character. Think about it: a cynic gave up his pursuit of being a hero of justice after the lives he took and lost now teaches the very thing he hates against his will while growing attached to his students despite everything. Despite what a radical shift in personality he has from past to present, if the writing did how I laid out above, he could've been a pretty good character, assuming they toned down the perviness completely and just made him cynical and partially lazy instead of basically a cross of Archer from UBW and Kazuma from Konosuba. I also like how he is an LN protagonist who isn't very overpowered, but that's not enough to save him from this awful writing. Celica is a hot and haughty woman who is basically never capable of being there since she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so overpowered that the narrative wouldn't throw a challenge unless they restrain her or just keep her or entirely beforehand. What I like about her is some of her almost motherly nature towards Glenn, like how she threatens Harvey for dissing him in her presence, even if the whole blackmail job thing was nonsense. Now, for the actual named side-characters with relevance outside of just one arc since I'm not even gonna cover the antagonists (partially since I kinda already did in as much detail as they deserve, barring one who I'll get to), nor will I cover small characters like the queen mother or the annoying parents of Sistine.\n\nSistine is a nightmare for her archetype. She aggressively checks out all of the boxes of a bad and clich\u00c3\u00a9 tsundere and does it in a way that makes her especially obnoxious. The fact that she has this dynamic with a teacher makes me even more grossed out (regardless of both the nonsensical age dynamic and partially because nothing about this is brought up). She's also absurdly useless, to the point that this is a legitimate plot point that carries throughout each arc until she finally does one thing right in the finale. Rumia is basically a typical dere-dere of the group who is basically the MacGuffin for all of the arcs in this show. I've already talked about why Re=L is such a shit character so I'll cover one more: Albert. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the stoic badass of the bunch whose hunch is always right, so there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not much to say on him. Lastly, why don't we talk about Leos? He is such a shitty character. He apparently had been asking Sistine our since they were kids and not only has he not let go of that, he has gone pathetic over it despite coming off as a decent person (typical of this trope), but again, the whole teacher and student bit makes it worse, and the fact that ha managed to spend only a paltry evening to be able to decipher everything about Glenn, Re=L, and Rumia is absurd, though it turns out it was this Justine guy from episode 11 who is just another evil LN bad guy for LN bad guy sake villain, since literally every single antagonist in this show is the exact same. They turned a crap and generic character into something creepier and stupider and then replaced him with the exact same character as every other villain in this retarded ass show; how typical! So yeah, that's everyone relevant. What a shit cast, am I right? As if the wasted potential as generic characters weren't bad enough, they reuse the same bad guy personality and have some truly horrible characters thrown into the mix. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s move on before I die of embarrassment.\n\nThe audiovisuals aren't much better than the writing, unfortunately. Part of the problem this time isn't that the show is badly animated per se, but that its animation insanely limited. Its own damn OP has about as much animation as a typical episode of this show, and there are plenty of reused clips, like the clip of Albert pulling Re=L\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hair or Sistine blasting Glenn with wind, and the slew of reused clips are reused at an insane rate with no remote variation. Hell, even the fight scenes have little animation, especially the one in episode 2 when Glenn beats up the attempted rapist. I initially couldn't stand the color palette but I got used to it. I already mentioned how awful the uniforms are so no need to repeat that. There is minimal (albeit terribly some CGI though it's blink and you miss it), but did there also have to be minimal animation too? Oh well, at least I like the eyes (they remind me of the trademark Studio White Fox eyes) and some of the admittedly humorous facial expressions. \n\nThe OP, \"Blow out\" by Konomi Suzuki is a pretty generic (if somewhat catchy) OP that feels like it should be part of a generic fantasy adventure anime, not a generic school battle anime with fantasy elements thrown in there. The ED, \"Precious You\u00e2\u0098\u0086\" by Sistine Fibel (Akane Fujita), Rumia Tingel (Yume Miyamoto), Re=L Rayford (Ari Ozawa) is absurdly MediocRE that I never bothered listening to the entire minute and thirty second ED. The OST is decent in its own right but honestly feels misplaced here in the same vein as the OP in terms of where it feels more suitable, even despite the darker tone the series boasts on about half of the episodes.\n\nThe dub is probably one of the worst dubs Funimation has produced in recent memory. Next to none of the voices even remotely fit the characters and sound like they'd fit completely different sounding roles, like Monica Rial as Rumia and Josh Grelle as Glenn, but the absolute worst offender here is Sistine, played by Rachael Messer, whose acting not only sounds miscast, but at times, bad in its own right. The tertiaries and antagonist roles aren't good either, and some of them were doomed to be inferior (like Re=L since it's much harder for a dub to pull off a loli voice), and the only voice I sort of see working is Morgan Garrett as Celica. Then again, dubs have been getting worse in recent years, so I guess this is to be expected.\n\nNeedless to say, I hate this show. I hate it so damn much. I only found one joke funny since it was the only one that wasn't predictable as shit, and that was in the very first episode. Any potential the story or characters had ended up being squandered rather quickly, which is frustrating since the first 6 episodes could've actually been pretty good had they removed the bullshit elements and made it a 12 episode series that fleshed these episodes out, though the last 6 are beyond terrible and impossible to redeem. Then again, the show lost any path to actual redemption during the rape attempt scene where they treat it with so little tact that there is comedy in the already drawn out scene. The lack of animation made the fights pretty dull as well, and a lot of the characters, namely Sistine and Re=L were infuriating to no end. There are times when a show offends me with how terrible it is, but when it happens more than once, let alone up to 5 times, that's when we know that the show is dogshit and that I'm in for a terrible experience. \n\nWhen I wasn't aggravated to some degree, whether it be mild or insane, I was pretty bored since the action was mediocre and the comedy didn't stick with me at all, and a lot of the awful LN school battle harem tropes are here in full display, sometimes taken to the most disgusting degrees possible to the point where I almost wanted to vomit. Also, the final arc is one of the most wince-worthy pieces of animation I have ever had the displeasure of witnessing as if arc 3 didn't piss me off enough to the point where the show went back from being bad but salvageable to irredeemable and truly abysmal again. Shame really, since the second arc was actually somewhat enjoyable at times and has the most potential to be good. So yeah, I'm basically repeating myself at this point so let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just move on to the final thoughts.\n\nYou know, it's almost cute to know that this show thinks it can get away with being typical trash that gives LNs a bad name just by adding more comedy, disgusting elements, and an occasionally bleak tone and more blood. It pretends to not be exactly like its brethren but does all of the same awful things you'd expect a show like this to do, only with a tinge of extra putridness. When there's a good idea, it's gleefully ruined, and the comedy is more predictable than a generic shounen anime. I've already spoken ad nauseam about basically everything wrong with the show and I'm basically repeating myself, but yeah, suffice it to say, this is one of the worst anime I've seen all year. Hopefully, this is a lesson to all of you that even among shows like this, there are still standards that some of them can meet and surpass their contemporaries, and that we don't just have absurd standards that only value high art. Also, hopefully you realize why this show is such a trap that you shouldn't fall for. This show scores disgustingly low compared to its peers. Well, with all that said, I bid you adieu."}, {"id": 3399, "score": 40, "body": "\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy hello there\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been watching you for quite a while. You work so hard, balancing your responsibilities at work with your responsibilities at home\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t imagine having to deal with the crippling irony of spending so much time pulling overtime for extra money to support your children, only to have them complain that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not home enough to spend time with them. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that? Oh, right, I forgot. My name is Masakaki, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come here to offer you a wonderful opportunity. How would you like to have all the money you could ever need? You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never need to work a day in your life again\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, maybe a little, to keep up appearances. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to solve all of your problems and improve your quality of life once and for all, then come with me to the Financial District, a world where an ambitious soul such as yourself can earn as much money as you want with little effort\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Oh, but of course, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a catch. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to succeed at the expense of your peers, putting your money up against theirs\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And offering up your future as collateral. So, my new entrepreneur\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 What will it be?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNow, if I were you, I would think twice before taking Masakaki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s offer, because this entrepreneurial El Dorado really isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t what it seems at the outset. As a resident of the Financial district, a separate plane of reality whose influence on our plane is disturbingly obvious, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be gambling with more than just your net worth, or even just your life. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be given a small fortune right at the start, along with an asset\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Your own personal battle monster to fight other entrepreneur\u00e2\u0080\u0099s battle monsters on your behalf. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be the ones taking a Stand for you as you encounter a wide array of both entrepreneurs(called Entres for short) and their Assets as well. One such Entre is Yoga Kimimaro, a college student who works himself to the bone to support himself, paying for tuition and rent with his wages.He seems to have developed this weird idea that Assets are people too, and he has a hard time making decisions as he seems compelled to do the right thing, and yet he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proven himself a force to be reckoned with. Will he be able to defend Japan against the District\u00e2\u0080\u0099s secret threat, or will this Entre receive his just desserts?\n\nimg660(http://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/21300000/-C-The-Money-of-Soul-and-Possibility-Control-c-the-money-and-soul-of-possibility-21396355-1280-720.jpg)\n\nToday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anime offering is brought to us by Tatsunoko Production, a company that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s somehow been around since the sixties without making much of an impact along the way. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably an exaggeration, seeing how I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not personally up to date on the history of Japanese pop culture, but with the exception of Speed Racer, Irresponsible Captain Tylor and the Gatchaman franchise, I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t heard of almost any of their properties. Maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all just too obscure for me, and for that reason I really can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get a grasp on what their work tends to look like on average, but C is one of their more high-profile titles, even if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name makes it really frustrating to look up online. At the very least I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen Gatchaman Crowds, so I feel like I do have some idea of what their modern works look like, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good comparison to make, as the visual aspects of Crowds were one of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s major redeeming factors after it started to get bogged down by all of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deeper problems.\n\nMuch like Crowds, C tries out a blend of two-dimensional and three-dimensional animation and art styles, The traditional animation is your standard fare\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little above average, the animation is just smooth enough to please the eye with clever editing to act as a crutch whenever it can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of attention to detail in the characters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 movements, and while I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really point to any of it being flashy, it carries a very subtle level of quality. Tatsunoko clearly know how to utilize shadows, and they seem to have a gleeful time proving it with a lot of smart lighting choices. As for the 3D animation, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really going to come down to a matter of personal preference. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard some people say that CG animation in anime is really jarring, and it makes the characters look really creepy, but personally, I love it. I loved it in the dancing scenes in Love Live, and I especially love it here.\n\nSpecifically, the divide between 2D and 3D animation is drawn very deliberately, to highlight the differences between the real world and the financial district. When we see Masakaki talking to someone to entice them into signing over their futures, you can immediately tell that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not of this world due to the uncanny valley effect of his animation. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little stilted, but that just adds to the effect. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a little inconsistent, but not to a majorly noticeable or bothersome degree. There are some shots in the Financial district that look a little odd, but for the most part, the visual effects in this alternate world are stunning, like the slow pixelated dissolves and the digitized action sequences. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get me wrong, the backgrounds and set pieces in the real world are highly detailed, but the interior of the District is immaculate and brimming with creative design, even though I personally didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see any big drops in quality to compensate for it. I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen very many shows that offered such a seemless blend of the two styles, which is pretty impressive considering this show came out in 2011.\n\nThe music, composed by Taku Iwasaki, is a bit hard to pin down, and from what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty common for his work. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say C has a bad score, but it can get pretty distracting when you have techno effects in a track that also includes a greek choir. The worst part is probably when he tried to emulate his previous success with the soundtack to Gurren Lagann by including English rap tracks\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yes, actual English\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But even though it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sound like it has any translation issues, it still sounds pretty bad. The opening, Matryoshka by Nico Touches the Walls, is a lot simpler and easy to listen to, although that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily make it the best track in the series. Is\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a traditional J-rock track with beautiful visuals that depict not only the plot and characters of the series, but the importance of currency throughout the history of humanity and our culture. The closing theme, RPG by School food Punishment (Seriously, how do they come up with these band names?), is more true to form for the series, even though the visuals are a bit bland.\n\nThe English dub was produced by Funimation, and since it had a good writer on staff, the apt Monica rial, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pretty damn strong one. Brina Palencia and Todd Haberkorn don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have that much to do in the main roles of Yoga and Mashu, as they really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to tweak their voices or anything strange like that, with the exception of all the voice effects for battle that they had to do. For the rest of the show, they keep to a grounded and subtle register, and it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t until the stakes are raised in the second half of the series that they really have to do anything dramatic, and of course, being seasoned veterans, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re more than prepared for this. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re likeable and speak naturally for the remainder, so I really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any complaints about either of them. Far more impressive is J Michael Tatum, playing a veteran entre with a dark past motivating him to some mysterious goal. We get the standard Tatum performance, that sly, smooth voice that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost enchanting enough to make an exposition dump sound palatable, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a barely disguised sense of malice and righteous vengeance lying under the surface.\n\nMuch like Brina and Todd, Cherami Leigh doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have much to do, but she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still perfectly likeable as Yoga\u00e2\u0080\u0099s initial love interest, and while you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be expecting much from her, there are dark turns she has to take towards the end, and Cherami portrays it all flawlessly. Monica rial does her Monica Rial thing, and it is of course nice as usual, and Sonny Straight has a lot of fun sliding into the slithery shoes of Takedazaki, a bat-shit crazy information exchange broker. The star of the dub is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Fuck, I really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to talk about this guy again, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Scott Freeman. I remember praising this actor before in Yamada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first time(the DVD of which he actually autographed for me at a convention), and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve mentioned him in some other reviews I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel like looking up, but all of that was BEFORE he got arrested for possession of child porn, a charge he plead guilty to. It pains me to say this(but not as much as the fact that I actually shook his hand), but he put on an undeniably solid performance as the otherworldly Masakaki, playing him as a sort of joker-esque fop. Yeah, if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to have to face the moral dilemma of enjoying the work of a pedophile, stick to the sub. Otherwise, the dub is pretty awesome.\n\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard of this anime, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full name is actually C: Money of Soul and Possibility Control(even though Edgy Digimon would have been easier to google), you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re probably aware that it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the best reputation. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the reasons I was wary to try it out, until it was requested by a friend of mine in a roleplay group. Honestly, though, I thought it got off to a pretty good start. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take long to realize that this is a concept anime, one that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s built around a central idea, and to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s credit, that concept is pretty strong. In an alternate plane of existence, specially selected people are given fighting avatars and are able to take control of a secret economy that directly effects that of the real world by letting them both win and lose massive amounts of what might be the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most well-disguised counterfeit money. There are a lot of rules that go along with this game, as well as a lot of details, conditions and repercussions, and I had a lot of fun learning about all of it. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to explain a concept in a story, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best to have a cypher character to stand in for the audience, and this was done pretty well.\n\nYou can draw a lot of metaphors out of this concept, although I doubt very much of it was intentional. The stock market comparison isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a subtle one, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still pretty smart and insightful with how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s used. You could also draw out an allegory for the temptation of magical solutions over hard work, but if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m being honest, Key the Metal Idol did this way better, and that was just in a single scene. If you were to REALLY stretch it, you could also draw some comparisons to bitcoin, but that would mostly be for fun, as I highly doubt they had that in mind. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not dripping with depth, but it has just enough substance to make the concept feel appealing, and of course all of the action and fight scenes don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hurt either. The details we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re given about this world are given out at a nice, pleasant pace, even as the series goes to some darker places than you were expecting, and several of the assumptions you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been making about this world and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rules turn out to be disturbingly incorrect. When you first get a glimpse of what happens when someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collateral future gets taken away from them is crushing to say the least.\n\nWell, it SHOULD have been crushing, but the lack of impact you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll feel over it is almost as disquieting as the lack of impact the characters feel about it. The major drawback from focusing so much time and story on the inner workings of the Financial district turned out to be a distinct lack of emotional resonance, part of which is the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s underwhelming characterizations. The most obvious example of this is the main character Yoga, whose usage as a cypher never really evolves into anything else other than good-guy boy scout who wants to do the right thing. The only interesting element of his character is his frugality, as he takes every opportunity to save his money in order to invest in his future, but this element fades after only a few episodes. His asset is even worse, as she pretty much plays the egregious female role of love-interest-doggy, her entire character revolving around growing more trusting and bonded with Yoga over time, which is a common archetype in anime, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s particularly awful here.\n\nMuch like Asuna from SAO, whom I also compared to a dog, Mashu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only defining characteristic is her relationship with a more important male character, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even worse here because she also took a dose of magical girlfriend fluid to the arm. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster, what is food? What is taste? What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a kiss? Master, I think I love you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yeah, they tried to do a romantic sub-plot for these two, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about as painful as the tsundere vibes between Rika and Renamon would have been if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been fully realized and not just hinted at. Yoga does nothing to earn Mashu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feelings other than bring her a cup of instant noodles, because apparently it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s SO weird for Entres to be nice to their assets. Not only is the evidence for this really weak, but hey, not everyone has an Asset that looks like a half-naked teenage girl. Nobody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flirting with their ogre and giant wolf Assets, but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make you a hero for having a sexy demon to talk to. Oh, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to spend much time on this, but the reveal involving her and Yoga\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Dad goes absolutely nowhere.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but I hear you say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat about Soichiro Mikuni?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Well, what about him? Everything about him, from his motive to his plan, was fucking stupid. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re given his backstory in the worst possible way, as he dumps a ton of exposition on us, talking to literally us to explain everything, which is lazy and unimaginative at best. I get that his father was being a dick, and that the nature of his dickishness COULD give somebody a cynical attitude towards the economy, but his story honestly feels weakened by the fact that his sister doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually die\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just in a coma, but Mikuni\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attitude is so vengeful it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like he already lost her. You would think that with all the money he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s making in the district he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be happy just to use it to keep her on life support and in the best conditions possible in hopes that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d wake up someday, but no, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing at all. Get this: The last thing she said before going into her coma was that she wished this moment could last forever, so his idea is to destroy the future and stop time. Except no, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not how time works. Tomorrow is still tomorrow, and shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sacrificing decades of your future work against the idea of your sister waking up?\n\nOkay, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recall if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how everything went down. I did finish this show way back in\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Three fucking days ago. All things considered, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m surprised I remember as much as I do. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really blame me, though, as this anime goes completely off the rails about halfway through, raising it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stakes to unbelievable levels that you will literally not believe. Yeah, someone losing their future might make their children disappear, or ruin their friends\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lives, but as an economical crisis begins to loom in the last few episodes, people begin dropping like flies, disappearing into digital nothingness. Their ties to the futures of different Entres pretty much turns them into vaporware. I found a lot of this hard to follow, so it might be my fault for not being smart enough to piece everything together\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m no economics expert, after all, and a lot of the more important details about the Financial District are left intentionally vague, but there was something that happened towards the end that makes me think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not actually mistaken.\n\nFor a while, I was planning to look up a detailed explanation of how everything worked, how the ending was built up, what was happening with the money, etc. It couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t all be superfluous made-up bullshit, could it? But then I realized that yes, yes it fucking could. Not only do people and buildings start getting erased from reality, but also ENTIRE LAND MASSES. We see a few island countries getting erased from the map\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Nothing that exists in our world, of course\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But the logic of this is just mind-boggling. So the Financial District was able to alter the geography of the planet? How? Did it add water to fill in the voids left by the land it took? Did the sea levels change? Did the entire history of those land masses dating all the way back to Pangaea get rewritten? Did the prehistoric creatures that roamed them get erased from the fossil record, also erasing anything they evolved into? And hey, why not take away any land-locked countries? Didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to stretch the suspension of disbelief too far?\n\nimg660(https://avvesione.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/c_the_money_of_soul_and_possibility_control-07-kimimaro-msyu-asset.jpg)\n\nC: Money of Soul and Possibility control is available from Funimation. You can watch it for free on their website, as well as for a decent price on Amazon as part of the S.A.V.E. collection.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d just like to take a moment to once again emphasize that this show did get off to a fairly good start. I could tell right from the beginning that it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t destined for greatness, but it was at least interesting when it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trying to do anything other than provide a Digimon rip-off with a cool backdrop. Unfortunately, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ambition far outpaced it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brain. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest problem is easily the fact that it wanted you to think, but it was way better off if you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. The laws of cause and effect are thrown out the window in favor of increased stakes, and if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not bad enough, I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen a main character that was this disconnected from the tragedy they were supposed to prevent since Evangelion. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a nice enough looking show, and I did enjoy it for a little while, but at only 11 episodes, I feel like things could have been set up and developed to the point where I could have actually cared about it. As it is, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty bad, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a unique enough idea that I can understand why people still remember it six years later. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just too bad that it lost control of the positive qualities it had. I give C: money of Soul and Possibility Control a 4/10.

Thankfully, I really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have anything negative to say about it. Diabolik Lovers has a very strong, very consistent sense of visual style, blending the flowery water-color aesthetic that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d expect from a shoujo series with a dark, gothic edge to a very beautiful result. The backgrounds are rich and highly detailed, with a lot of obvious love and care going into every frame. The character designs are inspired and memorable, if not a little on the rough side. The animation is low budget, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well managed, so it still looks passable.\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very pretty looking show, but unfortunately, that beauty is only skin deep, and this anime has a wealth of problems below the surface.\n\nTo start, the dialogue may have a few clever moments, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mostly stilted, expositional, and sophomoric. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re told a lot of things that the characters say \u00e2\u0080\u0098should be obvious,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rarely ever the case, as the logic behind it all is spotty at best. The six brothers have unique traits to them, but at the end of the day, they all have one thing in common: They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all heavily unlikeable douchebags who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care about our heroine for any reason other than the bright red juice flowing through her veins. In fact, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re so voracious about it that the only thing the writers have to do to endear one of them to Yui is to have them stop drinking her out of boredom. Nothing about them ever changes, from first episode to last. Even the flashback episode, which tries very hard to humanize them and explain their adult attitudes, just comes off as hollow for the effort.\n\nBut as badly as our male cast is characterized, they have absolutely nothing on Little Miss Little Bitch. Even though she clearly doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like being feasted on, she is submissive down to her very last drop, rarely ever putting up a fight against them aside from a half-hearted \u00e2\u0080\u0098no, please stop!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 request. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not clever, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not smart\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Painfully so on both counts. No matter how much pain her frail little neck endures, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even compare to how sore my throat is from yelling at her to stop making so many stupid decisions. Yes, I know, this anime was adapted from a Visual Novel, and the people doing the adapting thought it would be just fine to leave her as the blank slate she was when they found her. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not uncommon for the main character in this type of adaptation to be a self-insert wish-fulfillment character, but who the hell would want to insert themselves into a role that could basically be described as human livestock?\n\nWell, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s examine that idea for a moment. If you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t caught onto this just yet, Diabolik Lovers has developed a reputation for being incredibly rapey. This is a reputation it whole-heartedly deserves, on numerous different levels, from the vampires\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lack of concern with Yui\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emotional status to the genuine affection she develops for them as a result. But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to take it one step further\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think this show is rapey by accident. I think it was intended, in every conceivable way, to be a rape fantasy, with actual rape being replaced with fang-rape. And I can prove it, with one simple observation.\n\nSee, the icing on this cake\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Is the fact that the vampire brothers all eat cake! Yes, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bad joke, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not really kidding, either. The vampires are shown eating human food on several occasions, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suggested that they do so on a fairly regular basis. They like the taste, as well. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not hard to draw the conclusion that it sustains them just as well as it would sustain any other human, since no information either for or against this idea is ever brought up in story.\n\nWhy is this a problem, you ask? Well, in most vampire stories, the nocturnal ne\u00e2\u0080\u0099er-do-wells need blood for sustenance, which makes their plight all the more sympathetic and understandable. They can survive on substitutes, like the animal blood in Twilight and the synthetic blood in True Blood, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a poor substitute for the real thing. In Diabolik Lovers, however, the brothers don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually need Yui\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blood\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They can survive on human food, which eliminates the sustenance argument completely. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t physically need it, which narrows their desire down to two possible explanations\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s either a psychological compulsion(addiction), or a sexual desire.\n\nSince they express their desire for her blood right off the bat, and immediately start the process of \u00e2\u0080\u0098domesticating\u00e2\u0080\u0099 her, It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fair to say this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just an addiction. If that were the case, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be actively farming humans to drink from. Which wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be difficult, because they go to school, and are surrounded by human females on a nightly basis. (At least I assume so\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 We only see them in school once, and no other human characters are shown.) They want her, specifically, because she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in their territory, and she belongs to them. Once that sense of male entitlement enters the picture, It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get any more clear-cut than that. They want her blood not for the nutrition, but for the thrill of it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 For the sense of power it gives them over her, as they know in their cold hearts that she wants it just as much as they do, whether she realizes it or not.\n\nIn other words, the thirst for blood in this show is entirely sexual, and never consensual. For that, Diabolik Lovers isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just specifically designed to be a rape fantasy\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It is hands down the rapiest anime I have ever seen. Oh, and the fact that Yui is basically roofied in episode five doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help, either.\n\nAnd even if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able to forgive all the moral problems with this show, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still left with a terrible story. For ten straight episodes, we follow this helpless little damsel in faux distress as she gets bounced from vamp to vamp, having her seemingly endless supply of blood drained as inappropriate music plays in the background, ranging from romantic to borderline pornographic, a musical tone that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not at all helped by the way a lot of these attack are staged and framed. Her wounds then magically heal faster than you can say \u00e2\u0080\u0098Wolverine,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on to her next pitiful display of self defense.\n\nEven in the rare moments when she escapes, she never takes advantage of it. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll run to a church, instead of to a police station, and even though the crucifix approach failed her in the first episode, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be surprised when church doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work, as they just effortlessly teleport to wherever she is. She doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try to ask anybody for help, and at one point even consciously decides to stay for some forced, senseless reason that never actually gets followed up on.\n\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an actual plot in the last few episodes, but the writers clearly had no interest in it, as it has little impact on the story and gets swept away with little finesse, despite the admittedly impressive set-up that went into it. The episodes are mercifully only fifteen minutes in length, but the pacing is so awful that I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even notice it until episode ten. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no development, no logic, no consistency, and seemingly no thought beyond the desires of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s immature target audience.\n\nAnd here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the most annoying part\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 With a sweets-guzzling, stuffed animal-wielding immature character like Kanato floating around, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very distinct possibility that this entire franchise might have been conceived as a terrible Ouran High School Host Club fanfic, with Haruhi replaced by the author\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own blank slate self insert character. Seriously, think about it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The eldest brother is a lazy blonde, who pushes all of his work and responsibilities onto a glasses-clad second in command, and if that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prove it, nothing will.\n\nThis show is intended specifically as a metaphorical rape fantasy for teenaged girls who can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t decide between 50 Shades of Grey and Twilight, and hey, if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for, then look no further, this is the perfect show for you. For fans of dark vampire romances who DON\u00e2\u0080\u0099T want all of their precious bishies to be detestable douchebag rapists, then I highly recommend checking out the first season\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stress this enough, ONLY the first season\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Of Vampire Knight. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a great show, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still leagues better than this piece of garbage.\n\nimg660(http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/35700000/Diabolik-Lovers-diabolik-lovers-35717090-1280-720.jpg)\n\nFor the rest of us, Diabolik Lovers is an uncomfortable and often infuriating experience. There are some things I kind of like about it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It looks great, and I thought having the episode numbers represented by a ticking clock was kind of cool\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But overall, It just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any qualities that are good enough to justify all of the things that are glaringly wrong with it. For that, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think of any good reason to give it anything higher than a 2/10.  "}, {"id": 3414, "score": 31, "body": "Let the inspection begin.\n\nAt this point, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fair to say that if nothing else, the second season of Gundam 00 doesn't surpass the first. It is a mangled piece of machinery from beginning to end. The only salvageable aspect would be the fairly decent audiovisuals that got carried over from the first season. The animation is fairly nice, particularly with the flashy fight scenes. The new designs aren't quite as good as in season one, but are still serviceable as well. There's little to no noticeable CGI, and there is a notable improvement in the mecha designs. Additionally, the few new tracks they added in for the OST are pretty decent, notably, the episode preview theme, though it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t up to Kenji Kawai\u00e2\u0080\u0099s standard when compared to say, Ghost in The Shell or Musekinin Kanchou Tylor.\n\nUnfortunately, this is where the positive reports end.\n\nThis virus-infected scrap heap wages a war against nearly every surviving character from season 1. Thankfully, there are a few that come out relatively unscathed. We have Col. Smirnov, who managed to stay likable across both seasons. There's Ribbons Almark, who remains static and boring despite his role as the main antagonist. Wait, shit, we're running out of positive examples. Lastly, there's Setsuna, the main protagonist who is as static as ever. That is quite literally it. 3 characters...out of around 20. Christ. Everyone else gets their personalities and/or relevance hampered with to varying degrees. Let's take it from the top.\n\nNow that he's relevant, Saji becomes an intolerable Kira Yamato knockoff for half the season ( as if that invincible beam spam machine wasn't dreadful enough). Thankfully we only have to put up with this for half the show, as he's later reduced to a standard Gundam protagonist when he and his arc take a backseat. His girlfriend, Louise, undergoes a drastic personality change from what was once a sulking mess to now a person that borders on complete lunacy. While there's a plausible connection between \"I lost my family to a Gundam\" and \"I'm insane and I want revenge\", neither of the two seasons tried to connect these two states of mind. I get that people change over time, but this season doesn't show us any of that change when even a small flashback montage could have sufficed. On top of that, the personality change is so extreme it's impossible to take seriously. As it stands, Louise is an annoying lunatic that doesn't even suffer any repercussions for her actions. Somehow, she isn't even the worst case of personality switching, as Soma Pierez, goes all over the place at the drop of a hat. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, important characters often saw their relevance dwindle. No character represents this more than Allelujah, one of the main protagonists of both seasons. He gets sidelined so hard he barely even exists after his arc ends in the 6th episode out of the 25 that exist. Keep in mind, he and the characters mentioned previously were some of the most notable characters across both seasons. Even Gundam SEED Destiny, the same show that downright ruined one of the best characters in SEED, solidified Kira Yamato\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Gary Stu status, and made his friend and rival Athrun repeat his arc from season 1, didn't go this far. This speaks volumes, especially when I still haven't discussed everyone this season fucked up. Would anyone actually refer to this as a good sequel?\n\nThe new cast is catastrophic as well. The only remotely decent new character was a disposable snake name Regene, who accomplishes absolutely nothing and means little outside of a small alliance arc that goes nowhere. Given that this is one of the best characters in the show, it really speaks volumes of how awful and often disposable these characters are. On the subject of more relevant characters, we have Andrei Smirnov, who is probably the worst new character introduced in the show. He is insufferable from beginning to end, and he gets no real punishment for his actions. His quest for revenge against his father is as ill-conceived as his character afterwards is irrelevant, as it's only there for a cheap backstory and another character having her personality arbitrarily shift once again. Yes, one of the more noteworthy characters exists for one idiotic arc before being reduced to yet another nobody halfway into the season. The only important character left is the new Lockon Stratos, who comes with his own host of issues. For example, despite him wanting to be as far removed from his brother as possible (not even touching on how much of an asspull this character is), he pilots a borderline identical mech, and assumes the exact same role as him! It is almost laughable how stupid he is! If only this was an intentional showcase of how war can bring about the worst in people. Instead, it's a preachy, empty spectacle of intolerable husks in human shells, obliterating each other while shouting cheesy platitudes. The worst part is that I'm not even covering everyone here, not by a long shot.\n\nThe Gundam franchise has generally been about using epic war machines piloted by unstable people to illustrate the terrors of war on a physical, societal, and psychological level. 00 goes about this as bluntly and pathetically as possible. Everyone constantly shouts about how \u00e2\u0080\u009cviolence is bad\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009ckilling is wrong\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and that \u00e2\u0080\u009cpeople just need to understand each other better\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Somehow the worst way the series integrates this is by ripping off Zeta Gundam, one of the most irconic entries in the franchise, twice. The most mind-numbing instance is towards the end when the show takes from Zeta Gundam's final episodes, which show newtype abilities become as absurd as being able to interact with the dead for the sake of \"understanding people better\". At least SEED Destiny has the courtesy of only ripping off an iconic storyline of Zeta Gundam with the Four Murasame plot. This series apes from that particular set of blueprints with Anew --the lifeless Four clone of this series-- on top of the aforementioned \"understanding dead people\" voodoo. This is unforgivable!\n\nWhat a scrap pile this heap of a season turned out to be. Even with the major errors present within the first season, there was room for this second season to a newer model that worked off of what came before for a well-built conclusion. It may look clean and shiny, but this pile of junk was plagued with critical malfunctions throughout. To think they kept this line of defective machinery going with a sequel. It isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the worst product the Studio Sunrise factory assembly line cobbled together, not with defective equipment such as Gundam ZZ having being broadcast years prior. Regardless, a product that short-circuits out of the box is of no use here."}, {"id": 3416, "score": 40, "body": "> \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre my father and little brother dead too?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n> \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat does that matter? We were talking about One Piece.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI want to take you back to 2004, where an anime called Gantz was released; a gritty, gruesome action show from arguably the most inconsistent anime production studio: Gonzo, and it was a fucking train wreck! The finest example of a poor plot turned bombastic; gore, sex, nudity, profanity, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all here and is so nonsensical yet outrageous to the extreme, it can only be compared to shitty OVAs of the 80\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that had next-to-no restrictions on what they could do. Unfortunately, due to factors like fluctuating quality in animation, marketing and just being a downright insane show, other anime such as Monster, Paranoia Agent, SAC: 2nd GIG and Elfen Lied found large fanbases and have been fondly remembered whereas Gantz has been somewhat lost in the shuffle over the years. And those who have seen the show, while there might not be much to say about it positively, can certainly agree that Gantz was one of the most enjoyable pieces of schlock they have ever seen.\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a long 13 years.\n\nInuyashiki is this decade\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Gantz, albeit toned down in sheer crudity yet never eases on being an insane power fantasy romp. It is a sci-fi action series based on the manga of the same name from mangaka Hiroya Oku, and wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you know it, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the same guy behind the manga for Gantz. Coincidence? The story tells of Ichiro Inuyashiki, a middle-aged man that appears almost twice his age who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s down on his luck, being ignored by his own family and finding out he has stomach cancer. Just when all looks bleak, he is killed by a UFO before being rebuilt as an invincible superweapon capable of saving lives and destroying the world. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right, aliens pop out of nowhere to turn man into machine with the purpose left in question. But he was not the only person rebuilt as such, and while Ichiro sees this as a way to do more good in his life, Hiro Shishigami is an edgy teen that does what he pleases with his new power, most of which involves slaughtering as many people as he wishes. The plot may seem complex but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really just an eccentric take on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood v Evil\u00e2\u0080\u009d dynamic commonly used. The premise overall is very intriguing, but what matters more is the execution; how well-handled the show was, and this is where my problems with Inuyashiki begin.\n\nThe series focuses on the two main characters, showcasing how they each come to terms with their newly acquired power in their own daily lives, whilst highlighting the contrast in their beliefs and newfound purpose. This contrast is not hard to pick up on, with Ichiro wishing to help those in need and use his power for noble and virtuous reasons, and Hiro\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. Well Hiro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reasons are never really explored \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we only see Hiro abuse his abilities how he damn well pleases because he can. Hiro comes off as a child with this mentality, except even a child would have a more distinct personality than what we have here; a mindless psychopath devoid of human emotion \u00e2\u0080\u0093 an android in both anatomy and mentality. Unfortunately, there are no flashbacks or scenes of Hiro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past to show what he was like before the night he was killed, and that provokes one to question if Hiro is simply the character meant to be the villain and nothing more. Compare his situation to Ichiro, an old man that has his problems in life made evident, and when he gains insurmountable power he retains how he thinks and feels about others. Ichiro is no perfect character either; empathy for the man is difficult when personal issues are crammed into the first episode before being practically erased afterward, along with minimal time and focus on the relationship with his family, but at least I can say that Inuyashiki is a proper character that comes across like a real person. Whereas Hiro ends up feeling like the antagonist out of necessity for the plot to move forward, whilst allowing for a small group of fans to self-insert as the suave-looking overpowered badass with the world at his feet.\n\nThe points above may seem small when looking at the overall picture, but these minor issues become heavy burdens on the story of Inuyashiki when you look at the structure of the series. The first episode is all about Ichiro and crams a lot of content aimed to put sympathy on his character. At first it seemed an odd choice by staff, but looking back it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to see why considering how most of the following episodes focus on Hiro and how he causes mayhem. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to not see so much of this cool, calm and crazy teenager murder so many people with Wind Style: Air Bullets and not think that the show only cared about the amount of bloodshed they could animate across the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s runtime. Initially Hiro also uses his strength for his one friend Andou to stop him from getting bullied, but even when he distances himself from Hiro it does not change Hiro in the slightest. The way the show tries to intertwine both Ichiro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and Hiro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s separate arcs fails to get viewers to empathise for either main character with one only shown to be on his own one-man rampage from the start, and the other having his arc glossed over as he is thrown into having to be the one to stop the rampage. With the exception of a few times, Ichiro is chasing around Hiro when committing evil acts, stagnating much chance of his character development taking place and putting all the attention on the slaughter. This would not be as big of a problem if Hiro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t built on unexplained motives, coming off so bland and lifeless to the core that both men end up being as one dimensional as the show. The ambiguity was what peaked my interest, but that turned into disdain when you figure out many aspects of the story stays in ambiguity.\n\nThe worst parts of Inuyashiki come when they try to take moments of pure schlock seriously and attempt to have viewers empathise with the people in the show. First off, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incredibly difficult to feel for a character like Ichiro when parts of his life are brought up at whatever time is convenient for the show. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect to exploit a character arc so sporadically and have viewers still feel so strongly for him when they themselves are trying to wrap their head around what is even happening with the story. And Hiro, while having more time and attention put on him, is even more laughable to feel bad for when all he does is murder in the most apathetic ways conceivable, from shooting at pedestrians on a whim to asking a girl what manga she likes after killing their family beforehand and her soon after. He is a psychopathic murderer with the most interesting part about him being that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a psychopathic murderer. Real sad. As for one-off characters, their screen time is more of a result of poor pacing than anything else, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to feel sympathy for what is happening to random people in the show when the show itself is primarily concerned with being a bloody gore fest. Now a show like that is not inherently bad, but it needs to be self-aware enough to not rely on viewers feeling sympathetic for brutal acts on random bystanders, otherwise you come off as shallow. The pacing is also a constant issue \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the ratio of chapters to episodes is 85:11, meaning that the show is going to be fast as fuck at potentially skipping key events present in the manga to compensate for the amount to content. This only adds to the already apparent problems in the narrative and characters, giving a show with so much violence almost no breathing room, its audience practically being bombarded with carnage being succeeded with more carnage, only separated by Ichiro attempting to save the day and a god-awful romance subplot that makes no sense even for blind teenage love. The ending also suffers from the pacing, being incredibly rushed that even with how clich\u00c3\u00a9 and contrived it was, any emotional impact it had on viewers had the weight of a slight breeze. Inuyashiki was never intended to be an emotional story and here it should have never become one.\n\nIt is obvious that Inuyashiki is more concerned with being about senseless fun than a battle of morals between good vs evil represented by two men not even human anymore, but for a show about being entertaining at such a base level, it was a boatload of fun to watch. The ridiculous of it all works to its favour, getting away with some the most shocking yet hilarious moments I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in a long time. Seeing CGI-animated men fly through the sky at night alone is funny enough, but having a man-child act as if he were holding on to an imaginary assault rifle, before massacring everyone in sight while saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cDADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADA\u00e2\u0080\u009d takes the hilarity to a whole new level. Events such as shooting people through their mobile phones, fighting an entire crime syndicate with technique from World Star Hip-Hop and learning to fly from channelling\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Astro Boy?? How one cannot laugh out loud when watching this amazes me. Even when the main lead\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cybernetic enhancements are never looked into over the 11-episode duration, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even be mad at this point. This is schlock to the max and is only concerned about being schlock with no thin veil of depth hiding its true intentions. If years later if I forget the show or the characters, at least I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll remember the moments that made Inuyashiki what it really is.\n\nThe animation can be hit-or-miss depending on how you feel on CGI, and while I do think that CGI can be utilized well in anime, it feels out of place for the most part here. Initially this style is used only to show how complex Ichiro and Hiro are when they transform into the primitive mechanical lifeform, but from there its used more and more to where even basic walking will be computer-generated at some point. It becomes incredibly jarring when the show switches from the traditional 2D art style to 3D animation, and can also just look downright hideous, comparable to graphics from a PS1 era game. While it does makes everything look stupid and ergo more entertaining on a superficial level, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more of a detriment to the show overall. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s such a shame that this show had this kind of animation quality behind Studio MAPPA, one that is praised for their high production values for anime the likes of Shingeki no Bahamut and even Garo: Vanishing Line, which came out the same time as Inuyashiki and looks much better despite being a lot less popular. Inuyashiki by no means looks like one of the worst anime ever \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s asinine to believe, but I expected better. MAPPA, you got to stop letting me down.\n\nAs for the sound, it has its own share of problems. The soundtrack is forgettable and won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t affect the experience at all. What is top-tier though are the OP and ED; both are awesome. The OP by Man on a Mission features the most metal theme I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard all year and never skipped. Definitely the most hype openings and one of my favourites for sure. The ED however seems somewhat underappreciated, coming off as sombre and melancholic, envisioning the romance between Hiro and his lover and make it a little more bearable than what we were given in the show. All in all, both are great and one will probably appreciate them both more than the actual show. The voice acting here is very awkward, with some casting choices that have left me scratching my head wondering why were they chosen. Hiro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice actor is not good but at least I can say he sounds his age. Ichiro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice actor makes it as if his geriatric disease was out of control and he was in his early 20\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the entire time. Maybe an English dub will fix this, but as for now I can only judge it by how I heard it and it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pretty.\n\nAll in all, Inuyashiki is the kind of anime you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll enjoy on the surface, since there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anything deeper going on than an edgy teen acting like a supervillain with Ichiro nearly always appearing too late to stop him. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely an experience that most anime fans won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have seen before, providing the kind of shocks and thrills that will get you easily hooked to the show. Is it poorly written? Yes. Does it have poor characters? Absolutely. Are the production values bad? Well they certainly aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t great. But was it fun? OH HELL YEAH! Some of the purest schlock I have had the pleasure to come across, and no matter how many problems I can point out with this show, I cannot bring myself to hate it. One could call it so bad it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good, but terms such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cbad\u00e2\u0080\u009d do not do the show justice when it comes to expressing how I felt about Inuyashiki. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for an anime that you want to enjoy and is unlike everything you have probably ever come across, this might very well be what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for."}, {"id": 3417, "score": 10, "body": "__Warning: The following is a rewrite of a deleted review from years ago, and contains blacks, rocks, shooters, criticism, profanity and a score below 5/10. Reader discretion is advised.__\n\nBlack Rock Shooter has had an interesting rise to prominence, beginning with a mere illustration that spawned into a music video by famous vocaloid persona Hatsune Miku, whose attire was inspired from these illustrations. An OVA was released in 2010 based on the music video, much to the pleasure of many vocaloid fans that caused a ridiculous amount of hype surrounding the project that naturally left a lot to be desired. From there the franchise created their own line of figurines and a video game before finally returning to anime two years later, putting small-time animation studios Ordet and SANZIGEN in charge of the project to expand the franchise further than ever before, culminating in a TV series composed of 8 episodes in early 2012. Rarely does an anime come to fruition from a tangled background like this, the majority of anime use manga or light novels as source material to base a show around. Because of such, questions are bound to arise about the narrative, characters, structure and other elements in regard to a show when it has such a vague and almost convoluted history like this. Black Rock Shooter is a prime example for why such questions and concern about similar circumstances are justified, by being one of the most peculiar anime I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen, and not in a good way.\n\nThe TV series of Black Rock Shooter focuses primarily on two characters and two worlds. One being the human world where two schoolgirls Mato Kuroi and Yomi Takanashi go about their normal lives and first befriend each other. The alternate world is more of a mystery, coming off as a stylized barren wasteland where the enigmatic fighter known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlack Rock Shooter\u00e2\u0080\u009d wanders across the land, fighting for seemingly no other purpose than for her own survival. Unlike the OVA, this series does attempt to show that characters between both worlds are connected, with BRS and other fighters acting as the personas of characters in the real world, providing an intriguing, distinct expression into how characters honestly feel about each other. Unfortunately, the show was unable to capitalize on this at all with the 8 episodes they had from the very start. The first episode gives a couple lines of exposition on the relation between both worlds, which is an improvement from the OVA which had no focus on the topic whatsoever, but this is the only time when said link is ever touched upon. Looking back, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of pathetic how production didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother to do anymore with this concept considering that Black Rock Shooter is a series that relies on relationships and links, but they did the bare minimum when it came to the most important relationship of all; with the self. Constantly characters are shown to have their own inner conflicts that are expressed through battles within the alternate world, yet there is an ongoing disconnect between these settings that has a damaging effect on these parallel stories as each on their own have nowhere near enough content and focus to stand on their own.\n\nThe story of Black Rock Shooter is nothing special; Mato Kuroi has just entered middle school and she is looking for friends, eventually befriending Yomi Takanashi, a shy, aloof girl initially through their shared interest in a picture book. Slowly Yomi becomes more open with Mato as the show goes on until, plot twist, Yomi has another best friend, and she isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happy with Yomi talking to other girls! Oh my god, what drama! Honestly, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a silly middle school girl drama that takes itself way too seriously and has no real entertainment value that warrants much attention. At least if it stuck with only focusing on the two main characters, then maybe I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have such a problem with the plot, but Black Rock Shooter does not care about being a disjointed mess. After the half-way point the show takes a turn off a cliff as more characters are introduced with little screen time, only to never get a mention again. More \u00e2\u0080\u009cplot-twists\u00e2\u0080\u009d and backstories are added to give the story more shock value that no one cares about at this point, and it all bundles together to form this perplexing piece of work that both insults your intelligence with how simplistic it can get, yet confuses one with so many plot points unanswered to the point where viewers are no longer watching for the plot and only for the action. Which brings us to the alternate world of Black Rock Shooter:\n\nThis setting is a complete change in presentation, showing a vibrant yet desolate realm that is supposed to represent the mentality of middle-school girls; chaotic, turbulent, dangerous where peace among fellow wanderers is not an option. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kill or be killed here. All the focus here is action and it is easily the best part of the show. The directing, use of CGI and choreography were all impressive here and a keen eye for detail was present with every battle. Sadly, I would argue these scenes act as a double-edged sword for Black Rock Shooter. On one side, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s certainly visually impressive and the only parts of the show I would ever recommend watching, but what these scenes do is take away precious time that should have been used to tell the actual story at hand. As far as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m concerned, the action is second to the main plotline and if the narrative here is rendered to shit because the staff wanted to add more cool action scenes, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see how that makes the show better. All it does is turn the series into one where you can only enjoy if you \u00e2\u0080\u009cturn your brain off\u00e2\u0080\u009d and what makes that any better than looking at a fucking brick wall? It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help that most of the action scenes are jumbled together with scenes from the human world and ends up clipping the actual story, with horrendous transitioning that makes it all feel worthless. Maybe if they actually put emphasis on how the two worlds correlate, then maybe people would care about what happens in these scenes, but that seems like an impossible scenario considering the staff couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fucking do it right a second time with 3 hours to work with! \n\nBlack Rock Shooter has a very poorly constructed storyline that feels like a case of a show trying to accomplish much more than what time given would allow, but taken to the extreme and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother to focus on telling a coherent plot in the process. But as bad as the plot may be, the characters are arguably even worse. These young girls are both simple yet retarded, let me explain. Both main characters are fairly generic, with Mato being an outgoing girl with a strong sense of loyalty and Yomi being an introvert wary of getting close to anyone due to a \u00e2\u0080\u009ctragic past\u00e2\u0080\u009d. The two easily contrast each other and are in no way memorable until they begin showing signs of stupidity that does not match their personalities. The way these two react to everything around them is unnatural; they exaggerate to any problem they face and never try and think about it rationally. Whether it be Mato constantly yelling at every minor problem in her relationship, or Yomi getting the crazy-eye expression one would compare with an anime character about to commit suicide, these two are atrocious when portraying appropriate feelings. This is why I call them retarded; even for teenage girls they come off as incompetent whenever the slightest bit of conflict occurs in either of their lives. The cheesy dialogue does these girls no favours and only further implies that they have mental issues. This is also seen with the underdeveloped characters that are shown for 2 minutes before disappearing from the show, but I found the main leads to be unbearable. For a show that relies on emotions, there was always a feeling of disconnect between what was happening onscreen and what was happening in subtext. And now, after bearing witness to all of their actions, I can easily say that these are two of the most overdramatized lesbian characters I have ever seen; so bad that even the LGBT+ community doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t acknowledge them.\n\nFor the most part, Black Rock Shooter looks like one of the most bland and uninteresting anime in recent memory if you exclude the alternate world. The characters all look sloppy with a sketchy art-style with no identity of its own and some laughable attempts at highlights. The animation here just looks cheap, as if all of the budget when into the action, which barely took about 1/3rd of the series. The lighting was actually commendable when used in the more \u00e2\u0080\u009ctraumatic\u00e2\u0080\u009d scenes, creating a believable aura of uncertainty that helped enhance these moments if only on a technical level, but otherwise it was forgettable and almost absent for the remainder of the show. However, the action scenes are on a whole other level, showcasing some of the best CGI implementation I have seen in an anime and homes some marvellous camerawork and fight composition that makes me wonder why the entire show wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in CGI. When comparing the two diverse art-styles it makes what was hand-drawn look more and more like a piece of shit \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one of the rare cases where an anime has crappy hand-drawn animation with stunning CGI animation. Sound-wise it was fine: voice-acting, soundtrack and audio effects were all passable, except for the opening. The opening was sung by supercell featuring everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favourite vocaloid Hatsune Miku, and while some will definitely enjoy the opening, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one that feels out of place with this show, and one that I can easily say is \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot for me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBlack Rock Shooter was ultimately another attempt for people to try and make a quick buck off a rising trend, and now that the fad has quietly calmed down I hope that people can see what a pile of utter shit this series it. A successor to a shitty OVA that slightly improves on the material in some ways, only to make the plot even more confusing, characters even more infuriating and an impression on similar works where I expect such to be a complete waste of time. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of things I fucking hate about this show, but what really pushes me to the edge is part of the fanbase that find it \u00e2\u0080\u009cd33p\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that if you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like it then you obviously didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get it... To anyone who belongs to this group: Trust me, we all got what it was aiming to be, but what actually happened is a different story. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get it? Maybe you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get that a show which tries to be an internal character study can also completely fail at it. And with that said, I leave you all with the final verdict.\n\n\n_\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0099\u00ab\u00e2\u0099\u00ab\u00e2\u0099\u00ab Black Rock Shooter, where have you gone? \u00e2\u0099\u00ab\u00e2\u0099\u00ab\u00e2\u0099\u00ab\u00e2\u0080\u009d_\n\n__TO THE HALL OF PAIN BITCH!!!

She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been admitted into Stella Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Academy, a prestigious all girls school populated by students with families far more affluent than hers. When she checks into her dorm, she finds out that her roommate is away, visiting some of her family in America\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop her from rolling around in her dorm mate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bed, where she happens upon a curious item hidden under her pillow. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a diary\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a photo of a boy\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very realistic looking hand gun. And not only that, this girl has enough firearm paraphernalia in her dresser, closet, and God knows where else to make even Charlton Heston feel a little nervous.\n\nAssuming it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bunch of theater props\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Because Japan doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have gun safety PSAs like we do\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yura decides to start playing with the guns, acting out scenes from one of her dorm mate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Rambo DVDs, when a friend of that girl walks in on her, calls her a freak, and immediately recruits her into her odd school club\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Command, Control, and Communications, or just C3 for short. And what does this club do, you may ask? Why, they play survival games where they run around the nearby abandoned school house, shooting each other with BB guns! As the newest member of this eclectic little group, will Yura finally be able to overcome her crippling social ineptitude?\n\nWhile the slice of life genre has been around for decades, the new millennium has seen it become fused with the moe genre, giving birth to a sub-genre that has been a dominant force in the industry\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 School clubs. And they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re never big successful school clubs, either. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re always offbeat, struggling school clubs with very small membership counts and an entire student body that really doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to get involved with them. Since this sub-genre is clearly not going anywhere anytime soon, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little wonder that Studio Gainax would eventually try to throw their hat into the ring. But where other anime have featured such simple club concepts as music, amusement, love advice, and hunting down/researching paranormal entities, Gainax has decided to take it a step farther with a air-soft gun-worship club. How did they fair?\n\nWell, first things first, you can tell immediately that this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the work of somebody like Kyoto Animation, the kings of that sub-genre. While Gainax is well-renowned for it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s art style and visual direction, their animation itself would best be described as \u00e2\u0080\u0098inconsistent at best,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and C3 is the perfect example of that. The first episode, on it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own, looks fantastic, with great CG effects on the school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s waterfall(Hey, I said it was a rich school, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I?), and fluid movements from all the characters. There are some key frames, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re mostly used comedically. But including this episode, only about forty percent of the series looks this good. This is especially true during the gritty, decently executed battle scenes, as well as during the main character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 um\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Fantasies. But as for the other sixty percent, this is some stiff, cheap looking crap.\n\nC3 looks great when it really needs to, but when it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, the on-screen movement is minimal, and the talking heads tend to drag on far longer than they should. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s passable, overall, but when a running character looks like an animated icon being dragged across the screen, you tend to notice it. As far as the artwork goes, I said earlier that Gainax had a flair for art design, and I meant it, but C3 must be the exception that proves the rule, because this is one generic looking puppy. The characters look like they could have been copied and pasted from ANY other School Club show, with little change in design whatsoever. The backgrounds look impressive during fight scenes, but outside of them\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yeah, generic is definitely the word of the day.\n\nThe characters looking generic wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be such a bad thing, if they had personalities to help them stand out from the archetypes they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been drawn as, but sadly, that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to be the case. The girl who looks like a hyper legal-loli is exactly that, and nothing more. The pig tailed glasses-wearing girl manages the finances of the club, and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it, nothing more. The only thing she really does for the story is exploit the bodies of her club-mates at the culture festival for cash, which results in some very awkward fanservice. The blonde girl is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be honest, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. I know so little about her that I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even tell what archetype she represents. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s initially the second best player in the group, and she has a twin brother who dresses like a girl, because of course he does\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it. And the soft-spoken girl who discovers Yura playing around does nothing else of any note for the rest of the series. Keep in mind, all four of them are at least SLIGHTLY more characterized in the manga.\n\nTwo of the characters have backstories, but since they share the same backstory and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only told from one of their perspectives, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arguable that only one character actually has a backstory. These two are Yura\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room mate, Sonora, an older girl big-sister type who becomes a mentor for her, and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cantagonist,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rin, her old friend from America. The only one who has any sort of arc or development is the main character, Yura, who takes on the role of untrained savant, who joins the club as a novice only to quickly become it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strongest member. She becomes an expert marksmen after hearing a few pretentious phrases like \u00e2\u0080\u009cSqueeze without really squeezing\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cFire without really firing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t long before she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s able to pull off difficult acrobatic maneuvers and take out entire enemy teams by herself. Her rise to the top makes little to no sense, even compared to Yui\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mastery of the guitar in K-On.\n\nHaving said that, there WAS an element to her development that I thought was written really well. In the latter half of the series, she has to learn some very hard lessons about arrogance, ego, and team work, and I have to say, the way this was all executed was surprisingly relatable and compelling. The circumstances that lead to this development were full of a ridiculous number of plot holes, but all the same, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad they happened, because they made up some of the only scenes in the entire series that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bore me half to sleep. I honestly do wish that the rest of the series could have had that much effort put into it.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen Gainax be pretentious. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen Gainax be offensive. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen Gainax be balls-to-the-wall stupid. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen all of this, but until watching C3, I have never seen Gainax put this little effort into a product they were making. This anime is thoroughly a paycheck series for them, and they clearly chose to adapt the manga based on the strength of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0098girls with guns\u00e2\u0080\u0099 gimmick, and because they thought a show about visually appealing teenage girls wielding firearms would push a lot of merchandise, ala Strike Witches and Gunslinger Girl. Oh, and if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe me, check out the ending theme, where all the characters are portrayed as the kind of chibis that you could easily see being turned into cell phone straps, so thank God those don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist. As a matter of fact, this is probably why they expanded two events from the manga\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 A squirt gun beach battle, and the culture festival story\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 To maximize the fanservice content in both stories. Yeah, surprise surprise, the leaf and shell bikinis were a Gainax invention.\n\nFrom what I understand after reading 26 manga chapters that I was able to find, Gainax did take steps to improve the material by fleshing out the main character and the circumstances surrounding her entrance to the club. They gave it a new and much more interesting ending, involving the very lessons I was raving about earlier. Unfortunately, to make room for this ending, they had to condense the story down to 12 episodes by omitting any sort of personality or backstory from the other girls, then slashed the story to pieces and fit it back together with the events out of their original order. And here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where my \u00e2\u0080\u0098little effort\u00e2\u0080\u0099 complaint comes in\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to put any thought into whether or not the changes they were making fit the story.\n\nTo examine the plot holes that these changes create, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to have to go into some light spoilers, so don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t read this paragraph\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Or the next one\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 unless you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already seen the series, or are just reading this review for entertainment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake, and have no intention of seeing the show at all. Ahem. In the manga, Sonora has to stay home from an important event because she was injured protecting Yura from a sniper. The sniper turns out to be a participant from the event, and after being defeated and confronted, she apologizes. Gainax sought to expand this concept, so the sniper was changed to a random pervert targeting teenage girls, despite having no connection to the story in any other way. Rin is revealed to have apprehended this villain while unarmed, and no, we never find out how. Because of her ability to do this, and the news that her team defeated a team of marines, she is simply not the same character as the Rin we meet later, who is not only defeated by another team of students during a casual match, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s WITH Yura\u00e2\u0080\u0099s help. And at that point in the series, she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem nearly as cut-throat or intimidating, actually valuing teamwork and fun over victory for the sake of Yura\u00e2\u0080\u0099s development.\n\nAnd this change is started because Yura cheats to beat her at the aforementioned event. When Yura brings up this fact to her team mates, NONE OF THEM care, and are more concerned with whether or not their victory will be revoked, and they consider her a traitor for calling the contest officials and reporting it herself. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already bad enough, as it paints nearly the entire main cast in a negative light, but what makes even less sense is that when she reports it, the event committee don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t listen, because Rin said it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen. How the hell does that matter? If you have one person confessing that they cheated, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to say the cheated party would even be aware of it? If you have the confession, what more would you need? Also, I get that Yura has a vivid imagination\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Hell, some might even call them troublingly lucid hallucinations\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But what really confuses me is the fact that her friends can apparently get sucked into these fantasies and see them with her.\n\nSpoilers over. Well, there are other plot holes, but with a show this stupid, it would just be nitpicking if I took it any further. Those were the three most destructive ones, so for now, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s move on to the two biggest problems that this series has\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The ones even it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fans have admitted to.\n\nThe first problem is the uneven tone and confusing story structure of the series. C3 doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to know whether it wants to be a raunchy moe comedy or a gritty character drama, and it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t blend the two ideas well. Ideally, if you were to run these two tones at the same time while keeping them a safe but respectable distance from each other, they could actually complement each other well, like in Fullmetal Alchemist. C3 instead changes tone seemingly from episode to episode, jumping into each one with reckless abandon as if the other tone didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even exist. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to take the tension between Yura, Rin and Sonora seriously when you just saw a modified wet t-shirt contest in the middle of a crowded classroom. The resolution of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main plot isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even the focus of the final episode, which turned out to be a truly awful piece of filler filth.\n\nAnd the other problem is really the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest base breaker. There are several people out there who can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get past the first episode of C3 because of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loose, casual trivialization of gun violence. They see high school kids enthusiastically playing around with a bunch of realistic looking toy guns, and it turns their stomach. Speaking as somebody who was head over heels in love with gun and sword battles from movies when he was a kid, and would act them out with just as much vigor, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really feel that revulsion\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But I would not for one solitary second blame anyone for feeling that way.\n\nSee, Japan doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the same relationship with guns that we do. Unless you have a job the requires you to carry a firearm\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Such as a cop, for example\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It is illegal to own one. As a result, they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a lot of gun violence over there. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have school shootings, they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have remotely as many accidental discharges, and because of this, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not as sensitive about the issue as we are. Now, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel offended by the fact that the girls are running around playing games with BB guns\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done it myself, even though I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m absolute rubbish at it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about a show where right in the first episode, the club\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recruitment plan is to map out the school yard and ambush their fellow students with a mock shooting. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t carry through with this plan, but the very mention of it should be enough to get a respectable viewer to imagine tragedies like those at Columbine and Virginia Tech. Also, it really wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hurt if the guns were orange, or something. Some people will be offended by things like this, some people won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And based on that tidbit alone, you should know right off the bat whether or not this title is right for you.\n\nStella Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Academy, High School Division Class C3 is available from Sentai Filmworks in both Blu-ray and DVD formats. You could find either format last year as part of Rightstuf.com\u00e2\u0080\u0099s year end sale for about twenty dollars each, but even with that sale over, you can find them on Amazon for just under thirty. You can also watch it on Crunchyroll, and whether or not you have a subscription will determine whether or not you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to sit through a wall of commercials to view it. The manga entries have not been released stateside, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty easy to find translated scans of it online. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no english dub, and it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look like there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be one in the future, but hey, I could be wrong.\n\nGoing into this show, I was warned by a few people that I was going to hate it. As it turns out, well, they were kind of wrong. I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go so far as to call it a good anime, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen worse from Gainax, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see worse from them in the future. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest problem isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the uneven tone, or even the potentially controversial subject matter\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest problem is the lack of characterization, which is a thing that would normally be the saving grace for a lot of similar plotless, melodramatic slice of life shows. Without good characters, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really enjoy the humor or get invested in situations they find themselves in, and unfortunately, that lead to me getting bored a lot as I tried to get through it. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just my reaction to it, however, and I can see why other people would enjoy it more than I did. All the same, I would strongly prefer if Gainax kept it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ambition up in the sky where it belongs, and left the plotless slice-of-life material to KyoAni. I give Stella Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Academy a 4/10.\n\n"}, {"id": 3423, "score": 0, "body": "Prologue\n\nAh, Hand Shakers, my mortal enemy. What is there to say about this anime? Well, a lot actually, almost none of it positive. Released early in the winter season of 2017, it quickly rose to infamy for a planetoid-sized hoard of problems, with brutally vicious would-be critics such as myself describing it is a masterpiece of fail, among other things. If Big Order was that in the best way possible, this is in the worst way possible, for a myriad of reasons that will be demonstrated and abridged shortly. It is a new level of bad, a new low of over and underproduced, over and under-thought rubbish that lacks any creativity whatsoever yet fails in ways that are either seemingly unheard of in and of itself, or unprecedented in its sheer magnitude of awful. I feel no remorse or hesitation in calling this not only the worst anime of 2017, but the worst anime I have seen to date and even a spectacular contender for the coveted title of \u00e2\u0080\u009cworst anime of all time\u00e2\u0080\u009d. So, enough build-up; let the slaughter begin.\n\nPart 1. What positivity remains\n\nRemember the phrase \u00e2\u0080\u009calmost nothing positive\u00e2\u0080\u009d from literally a paragraph ago? Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s get that \u00e2\u0080\u009calmost\u00e2\u0080\u009d out of the way. The actual art for the characters looks really good, and immensely detailed. Barring the CGI (which believe me, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have a field day with), lighting (similar situation), and animation (take a wild guess), if you were to take a screenshot of the show, you would probably conclude that the show looks visually pleasing. Whilst many people would also praise or at least cite the music of the series as a point where the show didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t detonate catastrophically, and I feel this only applies to the ED theme  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYume Miru Ame\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Akino Arai, which is actually a decently pleasant and quiet melody, a low-key emotional piece that actually works, bolstering me desire to cry after each and every viewing of a single episode of this putrid abomination. Oh, and the main character of the show has these two parents who are just sorta there, being lovey-dovey to each other, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re only there for approximately 4 scenes, none of which are terribly long. Admittedly this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really much of a positive as it is damning with faint praise, but these are the best, least offensively poorly-written characters in the entire show, so we might as well take what we can get as fellow beggars.\n\nTo think I could squeeze even one decently sized paragraph out of the positives of this show without an incessant amount of filibusters. Either this is the skill of me as a writer, proof that even absolute worthless garbage may not be so absolute in its worthlessness as I thought, or just me trying to make sure I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come off as a hateful, prejudiced maniac hating on the show blindly. Most likely a combination of the three, as this show has sent me into a blinding rage on multiple occasions. Now for the plethora of reasons as to why that is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6where do I begin with this? In every other way, this show is almost equally bad and there really is no one elephant in the room; the room had to expand exponentially to fit nothing but elephants. Might as well go in escalating order from the aspects that aggravated me the least to the ones that vexed me the most.\n\nPart 2: Unnecessary praise of bad sound\n\nIt seems like a majority of the people who watch Hand Shakers seem to agree that if nothing else, the music in Hand Shakers is, if not necessarily exceptional, the best aspect of the show. In essence, I agree, the music in this show is the least bad major aspect of the show, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s damning it with faint praise, insanely faint praise. I already mentioned the surprisingly memorable ED theme and if you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t noticed, it is the only sound-related positive I mentioned. The OP, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne Hand Message\u00e2\u0080\u009d by OxT, as my original review (meme) described it, is a very generic OP with irritating vocals that sound somewhat like auto-tune with a really annoying guitar (which I never thought I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say about the use of a guitar), and it gives off a grand feeling of obnoxious genericness; a horribly perfect fit for this show in terms of my experience with it. The OP seems to be relatively liked by viewers (especially apologists) but I highly doubt anyone would consider it to be a top contender for opening of the season with stuff like Rakugo 2\u00e2\u0080\u0099s OP and Blue Exorcist Kyoto arc OP, let alone the year with stuff like the Re:Creators & Attack On Titan 2nd Season OPs, Youjo Senki & Princess Princess Principal OPs, Fate/Apocrypha OPs, or Mahoutsukai no Yome OP. \n\nMany viewers of this unholy abomination also seem to feel like the OST is actually pretty good, both on its own and in terms of use in the show, both of which I must quickly and snobbishly scoff at like the rude, pretentious, cretin that I am (because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m right and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re wrong, clearly). The music in this series is lackluster to put it politely and there is only one jingle I remotely remember and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because I purposely added the accordion from Sonic Unleashed Spagonia hub world theme into the mix in my head and that game has the best OST of that franchise. Very rarely would the music fit, like the episode 4 fight which has calming jazz music in arguably the most frantic and \u00e2\u0080\u009canimated\u00e2\u0080\u009d fight of the show (because episode 8 has more movement in its fight but the main source of that is reused animation from episode 1), or one ridiculously awful song that fails to give calming and \u00e2\u0080\u009csatisfying\u00e2\u0080\u009d closure to the end of episode 7 (the least offensively terrible episode in the show). So yeah, even the OST is terrible and handled poorly, which is to be expected from a show that handles visuals and editing like mech addict schizo wielding nunchucks with nails battered into them. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not even going to bother with the dub, which was dead on arrival given the character designs; let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s draw our attention to the one thing that wants to punish us for doing so: the visuals...\n\nPart 3: The assault to both the eyes and the spirit of art and production\n\nIt is not an exaggeration to say that this series has the absolute worst visual presentation I have ever born witness to and ever hope to experience. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start with the CGI, because it is arguably some of the worst I have seen as well. The CGI environments do not look terrible, in fact, they may look decent on occasion, barring the obnoxious GoHands lighting that is so unnecessary, ugly, and bright, as to rival the lighting in Mahouka for \u00e2\u0080\u009cworst lighting in anime\u00e2\u0080\u009d. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s everything else CGI related that is a nightmare to look at, most notably the nimrodes (almost every fighter has them and almost all of them look like Skelter+Heaven CGI). Chuckle-worthy name and spelling aside (yes, the subs I viewed consistently spelled it as such), not only do they never look good on their own right, look terrible especially blended in with the great art of the show, and have this one special problem the entirety of the CGI contains, which is arguably the most unforgivable aspect of this anime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind-numbing visuals. The CGI chain nimrodes are the most notable culprits of this crime, that being the borderline random frame rates. Episode 1 has this at its worst as you will see multiple strings of hideous and large chains moving at completely different speeds and frame rates, which is utterly repulsive for more than just the fact that those are moving the way they are. The frame rates of the CGI are never congruous with the frame rate of the 2D art & animation, which combined with the fact that the actual 2D animation skips frames liberally making it just as unstable as the frame rate of literally everything else in the show, as well as the fact that you are dealing with the most unwieldy camera in anime history (particularly in the fight scenes and the entirety of episode 1), and in the fight scenes (notably episodes 1, 4, and 6, the 3 absolute worst episodes of the show and some of the worst in anime history), you're expected to deal with all of that at once, it causes the absolute worst brand of nausea and visual overload ever produced barring the infamous Electric Soldier Porygon Incident! It is mind-shattering, eye-watering, and nauseating to watch, and if a piece of audiovisual entertainment ends up being physically unhealthy to watch for patrons of the medium it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in, then any good will or remote positive the visuals had is officially rendered nothing short of moot!\n\nIt seems as if there was sheer ambition thrown into what ultimately amounted to absolutely detrimental digital and editing effects to make the series stand out, with no regard to the capabilities of the staff working on it, or the audience that will witness said product. However, it seems that same level of passion was lost on everything else, including the rest of the visuals minus the character art, which was already a visual trademark of Studio GoHands, the studio in charge of this cornucopia of disasters. As mentioned prior, the actual animation of the characters is surprisingly conservative, even on the fight scenes, resulting in a plethora of skipped frames in the combat, notably in the fight that takes up the first half of episode 4 (oh, and the choreography is always egregious, especially when it comes to swordplay).. The camera only accentuates the issue here and it feels like they let the camera roam around and cause mayhem in episode 1, letting it do insane tricks and flips and movements unnecessarily in the classroom scene in that episode, then decided to put the Tasmanian devil on a leash and release it for these already terrible animated and produced scenes. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arguable that a lot of the series\u00e2\u0080\u0099 visual problems would be solved if the camera wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t handled so schizophrenically, but even still, the CGI and overall animation would make this show terribly produced anyway. While the art for the characters looks good on paper, the actual designs of the clothes, bodies, and even hair in the case of Koyori (which changes at the drop of a dime for no explained reason), look terrible and generic, with the bodies making the characters look younger than they should; this makes me believe that the main characters are midgets and that other adults in the show are no older than me, a high school senior (at the time of writing, of course). There is also egregious live-action stock footage for the food and the menus whenever the characters are at a restaurant, which happens on at least three occasions. \n\nLastly, to really sell just how bad the production values of this show is, we need to mention another rather frowned upon subject within the community: reused animation. Now, reused animation was considered rampant yet relatively acceptable and necessary in the 70s and 80s, and to a lesser extent the 90s, particularly with the magical girl and mecha genres. Mobile Suit Gundam and Sailor Moon were considered to be especially willing to use this and made that pretty much more of a genre staple rather than a simple cost-cutting technique; that was what the technique was. It was nothing more than a way of saving time and money for the studios and the animators working on it, and barring a few shows that decided to use it liberally as a toy rather than an occasional tool (Gundam SEED and SEED Destiny), it seemed as if the 21st century titles generally shied away from that tactic in favor of more digital effects & cost-cutting measures like CGI. In the 2010s, it seems as if most studios began dropping the ball just as hard but in different ways to some early 2000s anime, with bad frame rate issues and a resurgence of CGI that was bad even 10-15 years ago before they made vast improvements on the whole. So, where am I going with this? Well\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\nLeave it to Hand Shakers to bring it back on a semi-consistent basis, particularly with one specific clip in episode 1 that shows off some of the CGI environment of this show, complete with fisheye lenses, awful lighting, and the lowest frame rate I have ever witnessed in an anime (I am convinced that it is somewhere in the single digits). This clip lasts for roughly 12 seconds if memory serves, and is played at least once for approximately half of the episodes. There are a few more minor if still egregious examples (like repeating bits of the very first scene or the entirety of small scenes at points) but not only are those usually one-time occurrences, but if there was ever a moment that showed the fullest extent of how incompetent the use of ambitious and effort-saving techniques could be, this being played once for \u00e2\u0085\u0093-\u00c2\u00bd of the series, would certainly be it. Even played once, taking everything else into account, that scene is almost laughable to watch. There is reusing footage that looks good on occasion, there's doing that with bad footage, then there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing that liberally, which this show does if you somehow needed me to spell that out for you. Any show that did even some of what has just been revealed to you so far would probably be seen as a technical embarrassment and all around laughing stock to many no matter how good the plot is, making it have such a high barrier of legitimate entry as it is, but when you realize just how broken this show is from a writing standpoint, it becomes clear that even if Ufotable were to animate this series (since it seems like GoHands tried to one-up Ufotable in all of their trademark techniques yet only Ufotable has even attempted doing this apart from thee guys, making them the only ones to do it competently) and make it a technical marvel akin to what Akira was for 1988 and still is by today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s standards, this show would still be seen as a massive dud. More on that comment in a moment, but regardless, this is where a black hole is reached\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\nPart 4: The dead on arrival addition to the survival battle royale premise and how everything about this battle royale \u00e2\u0080\u009csurvival\u00e2\u0080\u009d game is more broken than SSBB Meta Knight and SSB4 Bayonetta combined\n\nThis will be a document the size of the Gate of Babylon weapons collection owned by Gilgamesh himself by the time I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m done with this part, and how perfect of me to use that because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to talk about the premise of the show, how the show is a blatant Fate/Stay Night knockoff, and how it was dead on arrival, visual obscenity or no. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s try to keep things spoiler-free that way we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go vehemently flying off the rails, shall we? After all, we are better than what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re reading about at the moment; let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dive into hell together!\n\nThe premise of this show is that seven pairs of fighters, each with specific powers, fight each other in order to receive a wish of any kind from something divine, with the main character being attacked out of nowhere and gaining both his female partner and their power to survive, kickstarting his inclusion into the this long since established event for said wish whilst defeating each pair one by one. Does this sound like Fate/Stay Night, verbatim? Does the protagonist sound exactly like Shirou Emiya? The comparisons don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t end here! Tazuna, the main character, is an altruistic high schooler and engineer who attempts to do most of the fighting to protect his female partner, his engineering is only a hobby and is rendered irrelevant beyond the second episode, and he thrusts headlong into danger to fight to protect his partner, no matter how insensitive and brazen he comes off, no matter who tells him to get back and wait to avoid risking his life as harshly. The main difference is that Shirou Emiya (depending on the version his character appears in) is a nuanced character who learns to not let his ideals get the better of him and remote common sense and his ideals are constantly challenged, and Tazuna...isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Oh, and for good measure, his team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s power is a sword that can unleash a devastating attack that fires a brutal projectile rush from the blade, and the main antagonist can pull out a myriad of projectiles out of nowhere for our protagonist to deal with in the final battle. Need I say more here?\n\nActually, I can, just not in the way you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d think. There is one key addition adds to the whole F/SN thing in order to pass it off as its own: Hand Holding. Now, before you facepalm, hear me out: Each duo must hold hands when they are in this battlefield called the Ziggurat (which activates when a pair of Hand Shakers encounters an enemy pair, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to why the Ziggurat and the entirety of the Hand Shakers game is broken beyond belief shortly; that will last a while...) otherwise they are kicked out and are forbidden from continuing their quest, and if Tazuna lets go of her partner, Koyori, she dies. All of this sounds absurdly stupid to say the least, as this sounds like it is practically impossible to turn into a legitimately compelling story (ergo this garb\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dead on arrival), and it also sounds like blade users would be at a crippling disadvantage and projectile-based users would dominate the game massively, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like the writers knew all of this. I say that because almost immediately after these rules are established in episode 1, the rest of the series disregards these rules altogether in increasingly contradictory and absurd ways. To start, episode 2 has Tazuna and Koyori in the shower and he lets go of her hand for about two seconds; nothing happens. Episode 3: Koyori can go 15 minutes without holding Tazuna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand now. 2 episodes later, 2 hours! They made these arbitrary and beyond unnatural and unexplained extensions just to serve the plot and make the two characters not always have to be in the same frame. Oh, and the pair in episodes 3 and 4 constantly separate so there goes another rule. Most pairs afterward break this \u00e2\u0080\u009crule\u00e2\u0080\u009d too, because why should an established battle royale require rules? I mean, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only a survival GAME! Forget facepalming, smash your head into the wall until either your skull or the wall caves in, because this is just mind-shatteringly broken!\n\nNote: Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually do that, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll probably get injured; instead, just imagine it or scream into a pillow until your throat gets sore. Maybe even use a stress ball or punching bag to relieve the pain.\n\nYou may have noticed that in the header for this part, I put the word \u00e2\u0080\u009csurvival\u00e2\u0080\u009d in quotations. Well, to spoil this show for you (you shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be watching this irreparably broken dreck anyway), everyone lives. This \u00e2\u0080\u009csurvival\u00e2\u0080\u009d game doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t kill anyone despite how fatal the damage may look for some characters. The closest a character came to death is Tazuna in episode 8 and he recovered right quick despite having his body beat up and immediately coming close to drowning (before somehow getting out of underwater rubble when no one was around anymore, because the idea of logic is nonexistent in this show which tries to be taken 100% seriously). There go all stakes, assuming there were any in the first place thanks to the constant rule-breaking and the fact that the motivations of the characters (aka their wishes) are as asinine and irrelevant as possible in context. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dive in as I will not bother breaking apart the already beyond dead plot any further due to spoilers and me not willing to even bother for the sake of my already ruined sanity. The only thing left to say is that even with all of this, it doesn't really feel like anything is happening for the most part, making the pain and misery more than pointless.\n\nPart 5: The \u00e2\u0080\u009ccharacters\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and their \u00e2\u0080\u009cmotivations\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and why they vex me so much\n\nAs any vigilant viewer who is decently well-versed in anime can tell by watching this series, the characters here are all worthless, comprised of mostly caricatures of actual characters; templates, if you will. That would be bad enough on its own, but each of these individuals is beyond terrible, due to sheer stupidity, asspulls, pretentious quoting, general annoyance, or what have you. As such, we have no reason to care about these idiots. I have already covered discount Shirou Emiya (Tazuna) and how horrible a protagonist he is, so the only thing to mention about his is that he wins every single fight by pulling a random new power out of his ass like he was Erza Scarlet from Fairy Tail (except he does it even more frequently and consistently, which is really astonishing, all things considered). With that uninspired and unlikable turd out of the way, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start with his companion. Second verse, same as the first, but with more brevity and composure...hopefully.\n\nKoyori, particularly at the start of the series, is the human equivalent to a pet, except with less personality. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a human vegetable that can understand communication and human needs. Hell, the ED gives her more personality than the first 4 episodes of the anime do! What the hell?! What is it with these MCs and having little to no personality?! I mean, as I said, she gets personality traits eventually, but she is the second half of the main character duo, and it should not take 4 episodes just to give one of the two most important characters in the series a single personality trait! It's not like she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a remotely good character anyway. Hell, she doesn't actually do anything (like fighting or trying to help in non-combative ways) in any fights except for the fight in episode 6, where she leads Tazuna to figure out what she figured out in order to win (and even then, he only won by new power ex machina). At least show shows some semblance of a personality by the end of episode 4, and is marginally more realized as a character than the rest of the twats in this show. Still, that's not saying much, as her personality is still vaguely defined and uninteresting. Also, her escalations are horse shit. She can gain more time away from holding hands...for some reason. Her subplot about trying to talk is only referenced for plot convenience and is never developed properly (not that I would expect such talent from anyone involved with this show), and she randomly gets a mahou shoujo costume and nimrod in episode 9 for asspull plot convenience as well, right after finally talking. Just...she either has no personality, a bland personality or grows via plot convenience, depending on the episode. That's just sad. Sure, she gets a \u00e2\u0080\u009csad\u00e2\u0080\u009d backstory about how she and Mayumi had a right childhood as Hand Shakers, but again, still doesn't help her much as the backstory is terribly executed. She had the most potential to be a good deuteragonist (secondary protagonist) but, as per usual with this atrocity, they squandered it.\n\nNext on the chopping block is the scientist, Makihara. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basically what's used to justify all of the nonsense present here with \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot enough data\u00e2\u0080\u009d or just by explaining some of the broken basics of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeath game\u00e2\u0080\u009d and is incredibly annoying, not to mention forgetful of critical information they somehow add more problems to the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s narrative (see part 4 or my original review for more detail on those problems). Sure, his past comes in handy in terms of providing a little bit of info to Tazuna, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about it. His voice in the sub is really irritating when you combine that with his mannerisms. The dub doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t win him any points either.\n\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talk about these other Hand Shaker duos, shall we? Not in detail like last time of course; my brain and sanity (assuming I had any left after this cataclysmic nightmare of a television series) can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t handle trying to regurgitate the awful memories in detail. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all abysmal and generic, even more so than our already broken main duo. I detest each and every one of them and have literally no legitimate reason to care about any of their endeavors for even a nanosecond. I'm need to take a deep breath for this one. \n\nWe have an obnoxiously generic and worthless BDSM pair, the bossy loli and bumbling male cohort, impossibly annoying siblings who play cards, act inhumanely stupid, and are \u00e2\u0080\u009cin love\u00e2\u0080\u009d despite literally everything about their relationship (from how they act, not their brother-sister thing, and no, the fact that the brother is adopted legally doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t count given they consider each other siblings) so that makes no sense and is only there for pathetic pandering and equally pathetic \u00e2\u0080\u009cattempts\u00e2\u0080\u009d at drama (as you can see, these two are the worst of the bunch), an irritating and pretentious (if pretty) idol who can't lip-sync to save her life (or this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life for that matter) and a hyperactive manager who is even more infuriating to put up with and can channel his inner \u00e2\u0080\u009cstar wars kid\u00e2\u0080\u009d during combat for egregious choreography, and lastly a certain final spoiler boss and pulled out of thin air new companion that should have been related to Tazuna given his backstory of his sister dying in bed with her hand stretched out, the fact that Koyori was on that same bed and recognized him, and the fact that this was thrown out the window for her (no, episode 11 doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help matters and in fact had a few new questions damaging to the show I am not asking here; read the original review for those). There are two other characters listed on MAL that do not actually appear barring one specific moment in episode 6 that is so baffling due to apparently doing damage to the enemy duo of that episode yet it has literally nothing to do with the rest of the show (How does something like this happen? Why are they never present again? Does this mean that there are technically 6 current duos in the show instead of 7 or...my brain hurts!) That was a mouthful.\n\nNow for the motivations of most of these pairs and how those motivations are surprisingly baffling. On the outset they seem interesting (barring the two siblings and their motivation to fall in love with each other, which...not only is nothing stopping them, but Masaru, in particular, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel like he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in on that at all), but then you remember that these are the motivations for entering into a kiddie version of the Holy Grail War! These are wishes that are relatively easy to accomplish and in no way warrant such risks. Part of what made the contestants and overall battle royale survival games in say, Fate/Zero and UBW interesting is that many of them had wishes that could not be done by normal means, like Kiritsugu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wish for world peace, or Soichiro seemingly wanting to settle down with his servant (meaning he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d probably wish her into becoming reborn in his time effectively or something). Nothing is stopping the siblings from falling in love, or whatever the idol and manager want, or whatever the loli and subordinate want, or what Tazuna wants or what the final guy wants. Actually, neither the main protagonist, nor Koyori, nor the final guy and his partner, actually seem to have a real goal, nor do they accurately develop one beyond the final guy simply wanting to meet God, probably just for the sake of seeing if the guy from the flashback was right. Hell, the first duo doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to have any wishes either. To be fair, these characters are all insufferable enough so if it means spending less time with them, I guess not having worthwhile motivations is ok for getting them out of existence faster. If only some of them died, since I utterly detest every single combatant here, some more than others. This has got to be the worst, most infuriating cast I have ever had the displeasure of putting up with for 4 hours, and discussing these miserable sacks of Goji droppings any longer will set my brain on fire. \n\nEpilogue\n\nNever before could I have imagined a work of fiction that could vex me so much I would actively become a meme of salt just by mentioning it. There have been shows before and since that have made me go on hateful tangents, but none as passionately hateful as this one. The visuals are a nightmare, the narrative is a black hole and then some, and the characters make me want to go on a rampage like I was Guts from Berserk, and all in all, every week I have spent watching this putrid abomination from either the 7th or 9th circle of hell has been a detrimentally hateful experience. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that is has nothing going for it, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just so destructively broken and malignant that it is worth less than nothing. If I could give this a negative grade, I would, not just for being worse than noting on most levels, but also because it's also the only anime I know of that can actively cause physical disarray for the viewer. There has never and will never be an anime worse than this, and if someday I am proven wrong, then at that point, I may have to give up my sanity once and for all. Never ever watch this show if you value your time, brain, eyes, or any remote aspect of yourself. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even worth it for a cheap laugh like I thought it would be before I saw it. It is a new level of bad, a level in which there should only be one resident for all of eternity. It at once is the antithesis of creativity and a testament to everything that can go wrong with ambition in art; it is the enemy of creativity itself! Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s give one final farewell to Hand Shakers, the show that broke my spirit 10 times over; see you in hell!"}, {"id": 3425, "score": 40, "body": "-spoilers\n\nHonneamise is a country at war. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conflict with a neighboring country has been going on for longer than anyone can remember, and the ongoing battle has shaped it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s society as well as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy. Many lives have been affected by this war, but a certain unit called the Royal space Force likes to think of themselves as above the conflict\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 So above it, in fact, that their lifelong mission is to break through the sky and take mankind to the stars! And they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re so enthusiastic about that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, that they have no drive whatsoever. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unclear why they joined the royal space force\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Perhaps they wanted a taste of military pay checks without having to actually fight\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But the general attitude among the base is one of blas\u00c3\u00a9 apathy, as the entire squadron would rather meander around the red light district than attempt to make any progress towards the heavens, to the great chagrin of their often disrespected superiors, who want nothing more than to kick their butts into shape. For a while, it looked like there was no hope for the program. Enter Shirotsugh \u00e2\u0080\u009cShino\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lhadatt, a cadet who grew up with dreams of soaring above the clouds, and eventually, the atmosphere.\n\nThat starry-eyed boy has grown up into a literal and figurative space cadet, plagued with ennui and depression at his lack of direction and overall dissatisfaction with his life. Even the death of a comrade fails to affect him, much as he pretends otherwise. This all changes when he meets a pretty young woman handing out religious pamphlets in what can only be described as a more modern version of Sodom or Gomorra, and the idea of acquiring God in his life does pique his interests, if only a bit. They hit it off, and her amazement at his profession inspires him to volunteer to be the first man in the history of the world to enter orbit! That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all well and good, but surprise surprise, space training is no walk in the park. There are several road blocks standing in his way, from harsh physical conditioning to the hassles of team work, to shadowy figures on both sides of the ongoing war who are trying to sabotage or straight up assassinate him for his efforts. For that small step for a man, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take a giant leap of faith if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ever going to have a chance of reaching the heavens.\n\nIt should go without saying that not all Gainax anime look like masterpieces. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say any of them have necessarily looked bad, at least not so far from what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen, but several of them have looked a bit on the mediocre side. Wings of Honneamise is NOT one of them. To be perfectly honest, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen a 1980\u00e2\u0080\u0099s era anime that looked as good as this one does. The animation is smooth and consistent, peoples\u00e2\u0080\u0099 movements are graceful and almost feel natural, even if certain shots do feel like you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching an animation flip book. The level of detail in the visuals is insane, from the elaborate backgrounds to the well-thought-out lighting and shading techniques, even all the way down to the gravity of a person plopping down on a bench, which bends ever so slightly from the impact. Facial expressions are also on point, highly expressive while never going off model. There are no short-cuts taken, at least not from what I can tell, and there was clearly a very high budget that went into it.\n\nThe artwork carries a very retro style\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Once again, this is the eighties\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And character designs skew more towards realism than exaggeration. While the color palette wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really bright or lively, it still worked very well as a complement to the film\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gritty, down to earth tone. A lot of imagination went into the little details of this world that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intended to be alternate to our own, from fashion and the technology of the times to architecture, and even the way the lines are painted on the road. This all speaks to the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s highly distinctive design, which is consistent all the way through, and just feels right, like yeah, this is how an alternate version of Earth who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s culture revolves around war would look, with nothing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And I mean nothing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Feeling anachronistic or out of place. Studio Gainax obviously put a lot of effort into creating this world, and I have no doubt that their brainstorming sessions went way beyond what ultimately wound up making it to the screen. This would prove to be a double edged sword, as it does make the story\u00e2\u0080\u0099s landscape feel more immersive, but it also leaves out a lot of details, and makes me feel like there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of necessary world-building that got dropped.\n\nHaving said that, it still looks beautiful, in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s muted, downtrodden and poverty-stricken kind of way, carrying a bittersweet taste alongside the stunning visual quality. You get the sense that the people are making due with little resources and money, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just true of the many civilians that show up and move fluidly in the background of certain scenes, but also surprisingly of the Space force\u00e2\u0080\u0099s uniforms, which look goofy and low budget yet still more than prideful. I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go quite so far as to say that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dripping with layers of atmosphere like Diebuster was, but it comes pretty close without going over the top, and there are a few certain scenes that are simply amazing in their presentation\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Particularly, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the scene midway through with Shino flying a plane for the first time, soaring through the air above the clouds in such a way that could almost be considered to reach Miyazaki levels of quality. It does occasionally feel like they were a little lacking on the inbetweening, as some shots do feel a little choppy, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an easy enough problem to ignore, especially with the rest of the product looking so beautiful.\n\nThe music was okay, but aside from a few standout tracks, it was pretty generic. I also don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to spend too much time on the English Dub, as the Japanese track is vastly superior and will obviously get my recommendation, but still, if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s English you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for, the dub is okay. There certainly nothing overtly bad about it. There are a ton of appearance by well known voice actors in it, including over a half a dozen minor roles played by Steve Blum, and they even have Bryan Cranston playing Shino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best friend, Matti. You know, the slightly taller and slightly rougher looking guy who\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Does stuff? Arnie Hanks has also had a relatively long career, although most of it has been live action TV work. Wendee Lee shows up in a brief cameo before taking on the role of Manna, an orphaned girl who barely talks throughout the story, but she still plays her like someone who doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk often and isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fully comfortable in their own voice. They all take part, they all put in their work, and they do a fairly good job, for what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s often considered to be the Dark Days of anime dubbing.\n\nBut the two actors who get the most screentime are the ones playing the lead roles. Robbie Matthews, or more accurately, David Allen Thomas, has done barely any anime work, as the majority of his output has been video game roles. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s playing a very subtle character, and thus is putting forth a very subtle performance, hitting all the necessary points of his character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s development. He obviously used a fake name, which was common practice at the time for union reasons, but the reveal of his actual identity didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shock me nearly as much as the church girl Riquinna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice actor did. Melody Lee, when I did a little digging, turned out to be Patricia Ja Lee, a former Pink Power Ranger. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard good work from her\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Most notably in an episode of Cowboy Bebop\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also done a lot of cringey roles, like in Lucky Star and the live action Haruhi skits. Her work as Riquinni blows even Bebop out of the water, as she dances on the line of an incredibly nuanced character, one who preaches and tries to save people, even when her own struggle for survival has led her down some dark paths.\n\nThe acting in this dub is great, and it would be even better with the help of good writing, but alas, that was apparently a bridge too far. Well, maybe that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not fair. The writing isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really bad, per se, and you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have many complaints with it if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just watching it on it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own with the subtitles off\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Except for one little part that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to in a minute\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But if you actually know what the original dialogue was, you may feel cheated over the lack of subtlety and constant unnecessary changes. For example, right before attempting to go into space, Shino gives Manna a message for Riquinni, and it gets changed from \u00e2\u0080\u009cTell her I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m leaving, and can I bring you back anything\u00e2\u0080\u009d to \u00e2\u0080\u009cTell her she changed me, and I want to repay her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Either way, Manna asks for him to bring back a star, either for her or for Riquinni. But the worst part is the ending, which takes a more or less okay monologue about not corrupting our home to speech about how hey, once we get into space, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be no reason to fight anymore!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Which has to be the most pretentious explanation of war that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard since Aldnoah Zero. The dub\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fine, but I highly recommend the sub.\n\nSo, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a certain comparison I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been making about Studio Gainax for a few years now, and even though I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been doing four years of a theme month in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s honor, I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t found the perfect opportunity to talk about it until now, as I believe it to be the crux of this movie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s problems. In my opinion, if Studio Gainax were an American director, it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be Michael Bay\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be be Quentin Tarrantino\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It would be Zack Snyder, the man who rose to fame with Watchmen and then proved to us all what a joke he was by making Sucker Punch, but he firmly cemented what kind of filmmaker he was with last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Batman vs. Superman. Like Gainax, Zack Snyder is someone who you can call many things, but lazy and uninspired are not among them. He believes in his projects, he pours effort into them, and he really, really wants them to be good, but he just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as talented as he would have to be to pull off the scope of his ambitions. He respects great writing and profound ideas, but he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand them.\n\nI feel that this is the best way to describe Studio Gainax, a production company that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all heart and little brain, who dreams of creating awe inspiring, emotionally impactful anime, but often bites off more than they can chew and winds up losing focus on the story they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re telling. A good example of this would be the religious symbolism in Evangelion, which shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be that difficult to use, I mean hell, Death Note used it well by complete accident, but no, it just winds up leading to a confused and muddled mess of an ending that only really kind of stands up under a literal interpretation of the events. Even their attempts at tackling depression and existentialism digs them into a hole so deep that they have to pull an emotional deus ex machina out of their asses just to reach a satisfying conclusion. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put out great work\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 With shows like FLCL and Gurren Lagann, simple ideas and elements were pulled off so well that the products didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even NEED good writing to support them\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But from what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been the problem for most of their work. They know the what, they know the how, but they never truly manage to grasp the why.\n\nSo how does this relate to Wings of Honneamise? Well, if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one thing people like to trumpet about this movie, and I will give them this, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that they did a really great job writing the main character. Shino has a complete character arc, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry, but talking about it is going to go into some spoilers. At the beginning of the movie, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s depressed, he feels empty and unmotivated, and he knows he shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel that way. He meets a religious girl in the middle of a street of utter depravity\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Which is a little touch I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also admit I really like\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And he begins to find a renewed purpose through religion. Faith in something greater gives him faith in himself and his mission, and when his faith in the former is challenged, the latter pulls him right back up before long. He grows as a person, from a deadbeat louse to a model soldier and pilot, and in the end, when he reaches space, he realizes(in the sub, at least) that mankind can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t run from it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s problems, or it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just keep on making the same mistakes, spreading it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sin wherever it goes. Change comes from within.\n\nOn the surface, this seems like a great message, and it even ties into his arc. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great resolution to his conflict. The problem? Well, once all that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s said and done, the only thing I have left to say is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 So what? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great for the character, and it teaches something to the audience, but consider this: He\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to come down eventually, or he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to die, whether from starvation, suffocation, or hypothermia. While the movie went into great, and hell, almost too much detail on how the spaceship was being built and how it was going to fly, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recall anything being said about the return trip, which has to happen. And even if he does manage to get back safely, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still not going to satisfy the people who criticized the royal space Force for wasting potential war and/or food money on a pointless endeavor. In fact, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll probably be even more pissed off, since they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re likely going to need even MORE money for their next trip to the stars. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m also having a hard time believing that their accomplishment will end war, because even though the rocket blasting off was shown to shock fighting soldiers into freezing in their paths, what does reaching space have to do with poor foreign relationships?\n\nIf anything, their enemies will be either jealous of them, want to fight them even harder to obtain their technology, or they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll become afraid of what an enemy with space travel possibilities can do to them, forcing them into action. I also don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see what good Shino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speech is going to accomplish, because while I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t THINK it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ever explained what the two countries are fighting for, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s usually some kind of reason for fighting to take place, and whatever it is, no logic is going to cause warring powers to lay down their guns and start getting along. Yeah, Shino went into space, and gave everyone a lecture, but once he comes down, everything\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to go back to the way it was, both for him and for his country. He hated being a celebrity before the flight, now it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just going to be worse. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to become the most famous man on the planet. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see his flight changing Riquinna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life, unless he marries her and shares his wealth with her, and the odds that being back on Earth with his space faring days behind him will drive him back down into a brand new cycle of depression are disturbingly high.\n\nAnd that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where Gainax\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true failure lies. They were so focused on writing out Shino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character arc that they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop to think about the bigger picture, and the effect that his accomplishment would have on the world they built. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fine if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think about it, but when you do, Shino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s big moment just feels like an empty, pointless blip in a long timeline of life just generally being shit. I legitimately can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see a sequel to this movie feeling realistic without him coming back to Earth, and eventually committing suicide over the fact that his life dream has already ended, and his life\u00e2\u0080\u0099s purpose has already peaked. For a story that strives towards one goal, one symbol of impossible hope that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meant to inspire it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s audience, nothing is really accomplished, which just ends up making the overall experience feel empty and bleak. Would it be like this if there was a tighter focus on the main character, and the war was left out of the story completely? No, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it would be. But on that note, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of stuff in this movie that should have been cut out.\n\nFor starters, while Shino and Riquinni are pretty well written, everybody else\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Literally everybody else\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Gets the shaft. Shino has a lot of friends\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The big doofus, the long haired short dude, the best friend who does stuff, and while I promise you they all have names, you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know them, and if they even say them\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 You won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember them. They might as well not even be in the movie. That would at least make the training montages(yes, plural,) a little shorter. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a character named Doc, who only has three scenes, is actually kind of likeable in two of them, but then he dies offscreen leaving no impact whatsoever. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a named character dying. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot more pointless characters, but what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even more damning is the pointless world-building, as the ongoing war does nothing other than to add some tension to the launch, and the attempts at assassinating Shino and Matti are nothing more than filler. With so much going on, and so many problems happening with this fictitious world, the stakes for Shino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s space trip feel a lot more paltry than they would if all that material were just left by the wayside in the first place. At two hours long, this movie didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to be more than forty-five minutes.\n\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a controversial scene where Shino tries to rape Riquinni, and while a lot of people think of it as the single blemish that keeps this movie from becoming a masterpiece, I honestly don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind it so much. I mean, it bothered me the first time, but\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to that. People tend to think that it comes out of nowhere, that it makes a good person character look like a misogynist asshole, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sexist, it seriously undermines the religious aspect of the story\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I disagree on all counts. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say it was important, or that what it accomplished couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have been achieved better through other means, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really not as bad as everyone says. First of all, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never try to make excuses for a sexual assailant, this didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come out of nowhere\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The catalyst was just way too subtle. See, Shino has tried to become more than friends with Riquinni, but was rejected, and he took it like a champ, respecting her and continuing to come to her for religion and deeper meaning. But then he finds out something about her that flies under the radar of a lot of viewers, including myself on my first viewing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a prostitute.\n\nNow, obviously this is a situational thing, as she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just selling her body to put food on the table for herself and Manna, but in Shino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disenfranchised mind, the same religion that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s keeping him away from her hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been keeping her away from other men, so for that one brief moment, he becomes beset by jealousy and entitlement, and sees her as less than a person. I know rape is a thing that deserves to be demonized, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to remember that while it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely a bad thing, good people do it, too. No matter who you are, you can make a mistake that will affect you and another person for the rest of your lives, because even good people can succumb to poor judgement. Now, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get me wrong, humanizing rape does NOT excuse it or defend it, it just teaches you that yes, even YOU could rationalize yourself into performing terrible acts, so don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ever think of yourself as above them, or you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re more likely to wind up doing the same thing Shino does. Thankfully, he stops himself.\n\nRiquinni also defends herself, justifiably so, which is where I really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get the sexism criticism. She doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just blush, turn her head and ask him to be gentle, as a FUCKING TON of anime would have her do, she clocks him for it. If anything her apology for using violence to defend herself says a lot more about the effect religion can have on people than it does about gender politics. In any case, like I said earlier, this is the event that challenges his faith in a higher power, which he recovers from thanks to his faith in himself and his mission, and this could have been achieved in a number of ways that DIDN\u00e2\u0080\u0099T involve rape, but the reason I think it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work, and the reason I think it makes people so damned uncomfortable, is because, as I said, the reveal of her turning to prostitution is way too subtle. the visual of her pouring money out of her boot just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t clear enough to explain what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on, so yeah, that is a huge problem, but is it the single blemish on an otherwise masterpiece? No. Not even close.\n\nRoyal Space Force: The Wings of Honneamise is available stateside on many different DVD releases, including a Pioneer release, a Manga Video release, a couple of imported versions, and most recently, a Maiden Japan release, and chances are you can find it online for cheap. A four minute pilot to the movie, commissioned by Gainax two years prior, has not been released stateside, at least as far as I know. You can also view the film on Hulu.\n\nWings of Honneamise is considered by many to be a Gainax classic, an untouchable masterpiece with a very important place in anime history. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t disagree with that last part, as pretty much all of Gainax\u00e2\u0080\u0099s early work has been highly influential on the medium, but I kinda feel like squeezing the brakes on calling it a masterpiece. Yeah, the animation is almost unrealistically great, and Shino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character arc does offer a compelling character study, but aside from the few things that I do agree are noteworthy about it, I just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very good movie. The pacing is garbage, the scenes feel like they could have been shuffled out of order without losing very much impact, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost no attempt at foreshadowing a lot of what should have been important events. I do respect Gainax for it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ambition and creativity\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, back then, at least\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But as writers, this movie carries a lot of the issues that have always plagued them. Their work may be important, it may be influential, but it benefits heavily from peoples\u00e2\u0080\u0099 nostalgia. Case in point, this movie may have looked beautiful, but it was so full of pulp and badly focused that I could barely manage to stay awake. I give Royal Space Force; Wings of Honneamise a 4/10."}, {"id": 3426, "score": 40, "body": "In the long history of the Earth, there have been several major mass extinctions, each one wiping millions of life forms out of existence. Because of this, over ninety nine percent of all life forms that have ever existed on earth are now gone forever. But what caused these mass extinctions, what was their true purpose, and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 When will it happen again?\n\nFollowing this admittedly intriguing monologue, we cut to our main character, Takeru Takemoto, delivering a monologue of his own. He talks about war, famine, disease, and all that fun stuff as an excuse to get out of helping his classmates clean the pool. Yes, this is our main character. He then lies around, wondering what he should do while doing absolutely nothing. And in the same episode, he remarks that his uncle, who owns his own delivery service AND dormitories, where Takeru is living for free, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ambitious enough.\n\nThis is a person that I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be friends with under any circumstances, and yet he actually has a healthy little collection of five friends that spend way too much time at his dorm and obsess way too hard over his love life. But I digress.\n\nHe and his best friend Ryou are out making a delivery when they witness a bright comet shooting down from the sky. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t move like an inanimate object, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It moves like it has a destination in mind, and after following this light, Takeru discovers a beautiful naked girl with orange hair\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Who he names Hikari. Japanese for light, of course. Because Chi. She forms an instant attachment to him\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Like a newborn animal would\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and their whirlwind romance thus begins.\n\nMuch like Mahoromatic, this series was a joint effort between Studio Gainax and Studio Shaft. While neither studio is perfect, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve both released some poor looking shows in the past, the animation in This Ugly is embarrassing by either studio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s standards. The budget was clearly bare bones, and even the high points of the story are marred by obvious tricks like sudden technique changes, bounce-walking, and speed lines. The artwork is equally bad, with flat coloring, boring backgrounds, and enough jagged outlines to make FMA Brotherhood look lovingly rendered.\n\nAs far as the character designs, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re nothing special\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Derivative and forgettable are the words of the day, at least for the most part. The only thing really noteworthy is the insert from the first volume DVD, in which the Character Designer and Chief Animation Director himself chronicles his reasons behind each design. Without any exaggeration, his explanations range from such deep, complex specifications as \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought this would be cute\u00e2\u0080\u009d to \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wanted him to look cool\u00e2\u0080\u009d to \u00e2\u0080\u009cI like large breasts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAlthough one of Takeru\u00e2\u0080\u0099s buddies was apparently based on a famous Japanese motorcycle who died shortly before production began. Do with that tidbit as you will.\n\nAs for the music? I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like it. The tunes were repeated over and over again, which sucks, because I find about half of them distracting and inappropriate to the series. The opening, however, is a thing of beauty, possibly one of the top ten of 2004.\n\nIn any case, for the sake of Studio Gainax\u00e2\u0080\u0099s twentieth anniversary production, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll suspend disbelief and pretend that science doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll pretend that each mass extinction was caused by a supernatural being that periodically comes to earth on a comet, takes the form of whatever the most intelligent creature in existence is at that time, and evaluates the world to see if it needs to be demolished. We won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ask where they came from, or how this system came to be, or how the Earth knows to send battle monsters to stop these entities, because we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to go to bed feeling as though we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve wasted precious energy that we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get back.\n\nThe entity splits into two, and this time around, those two take the form of hyper-sexualized teenaged moe girls who are given the names of Hikari and Akari. Yes, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a spoiler, but trust me, knowing that in advance won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hurt anything. Hikari winds up with lazy boy Takeru, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll call that Story A. Akari winds up in the home of the space cadet Ryou, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll call that Story B. Story A, as I mentioned in my plot summary, is a romance tale. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to say this up front, it is a very weak romance tale. Both of our main characters are completely milquetoast, with the only really interesting thing about either one being their tragic backstories. They flounder in their efforts to form a relationship, and while there is a pretty good reason, the awkwardness between them can sometimes be flat-out painful. I mean, I have Asperger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s syndrome, and even *I* wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t strike out in some of the situations that Takeru finds himself in.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, we have the B side of the story, which in my opinion should have been the true A side, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot stronger. Ryou is a pretty damn likeable character, despite all his bishie-ness. While laid back and easy-going, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very paternal figure to his precocious little sister, whom he allows to think that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the one in charge. They pick up Akari, and while I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be hard-pressed to say she has any important role in the story, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still given much more personality and development than her \u00e2\u0080\u0098sister\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is. I may be alone in this, but I found myself enjoying the show a lot more when the three of them were on screen. They even get some pretty good blink-and-you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll-miss-it sight gags, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking hard enough. Like Ryou being the only person on a test of courage to be dressed as a western monster. or Akari catching a giant fish with a nude bear-hug, only to be seen subtly gnawing on it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s severed head at lunch a few scenes later.\n\nAs for the supporting cast, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little to no support to be found. Takeru has two male friends, who obsess over the fact that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s living with a hot girl, and two female friends, who call those two stupid. Oh, they also coordinate activities and make clothes for the aliens. Overall, characters that need not exist, as there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing they contribute to the plot that other characters couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t offer. I found myself wondering why they all invested so much of their time in such a boring character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life.\n\nHe Also has a cousin named Mari who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s madly in love with him, but didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know it until he was taken\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I guess I should be disgusted by that, but this is Japan, and that DOES sound like typical teenage logic. Besides, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hate a Luci Christian character. What I can hate, however, is the American scientist that lives in their dorm, and embodies every single stereotype that the Japanese may have against American women. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loose, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an alcoholic, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s immodest, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always making passes at her teenage co-stars, she looks like Ritsuko Akagi\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investigating the mass extinction, and she just happens to move into the exact right dorm house. Hikari introduces herself as an alien, so of course, Jennifer Portman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first instinct is to shower with her.\n\nThey also have two alien sidekicks named Ku-on and Ionios, and I actually found them to be quite funny.\n\nNow, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk about the English dub without addressing a very interesting little fact. For whatever reason, the majority of the actors used really ridiculous false names. Was the show so bad that they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want their names attached to it, or was this just a joke? I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find any explanation, but if I meet one of them at a con, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be my first question.\n\nCynthia Martinez\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 AKA Goldie Fawn\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Has been a favorite of mine in some shows, and I never really minded her gravely voice up until now. Her line deliveries are spot on, but the tone and pitch of Hikari\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice makes HER voice sound like a dying cat. Shelley Calleen Black does a great job relaying all of Ms. Portman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eccentricities, as much as I may hate the character, and Hilary Haag\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 AKA Alexis Bestman\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 is adorable in the role of Kimi. Quentin Haag, presumably related to her, has only had seven acting roles to date, but he does a pretty decent job in the role of Ryou.\n\nBraden Hunt doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair nearly as well in the role of Takeru, giving a performance that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s charmless and wooden throughout. Taylor Hannah, Chris Patton and Monica rial are wasted in low profile roles, when they could have easily taken on the starring roles by themselves. Patton and Rial as Takeru and Hikari? Yes, please!\n\nBut the star of the dub is Jessica Boone\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Or Circe Nightshade of SNL fame\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 playing the role of Akari. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s playing a sweet, wide-eyed innocent who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trying to enjoy life to the fullest as she secretly evaluates it, waiting patiently for a tragedy that she knows will eventually occur\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a subtle performance, and she plays with this nuance beautifully. Hell, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so good that other actors sound better just by interacting with her.\n\nFun fact: About half of the affore-mentioned characters will, at some point, make a pretentious speech. Okay, so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a very fun fact, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a fact that can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be avoided. Gainax has always been known to indulge in pretense, but this particular project takes that predilection to a whole new level. This anime is very pretentious, and it LOVES to hear itself talk. The characters are blabbing with more ideas than the series is willing to commit to, ruminating on the nature of life, and spewing philosophical metaphors that barely make sense and never really get explored. This is where the collaboration of Gainax and Shaft comes to blows, as it seems like the former is trying it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s damnedest to bring depth to the material, which the latter is trying to jam with as much gratuitous nudity as possible.\n\nThe basic plot could be an interesting one, scientific heresy be damned, but the writing that should be supporting it is awful, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not just talking about the awkward translations. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s barely any development, way too many characters, character descriptions that are told to us rather than shown to us, constant otaku pandering, and aimless philosophizing that serves no purpose other than to jam the characters heads up their shiny asses. The humor occasionally works, and when it does, the comic timing is spot-on. But this show isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t focused on being funny. It tries to be serious and tell it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story, while dishing out wacky hijinks and harem cliches, despite not really being a harem show. The filler material makes up half of the story, and it can range from tolerable at best to painful at worst, with the obligatory beach episode being a particularly low note.\n\nAnd yet, even when it is focused entirely on it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plot, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still barely watchable, as that plot relies too much on it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s milquetoast leads. I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reveal how the multi-episode climax plays out, but it is both catalyzed and carried through by some of the most melodramatic high school bullshit ever animated.\n\nIn short, I rarely ever see a story or plot that are executed this terribly.\n\nHowever, despite my complaints, I like this show. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get me wrong, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bad, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no arguing that. It might be the worst Gainax show that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen, and it rips off former Gainax properties without mercy or restraint. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pleasant kind of bad\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The kind you pop into your DVD player when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re feeling bored and forgiving. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lighthearted, and if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not overthinking it, it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t too insulting or offensive either. And I genuinely do like the side B story, at least for what it offers. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an ugly show, without a doubt, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still some beauty to it, which is why I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to be generous and give it a 4/10. You can shave off two full points if underaged nudity gives you the creeps, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll understand completely."}, {"id": 3438, "score": 45, "body": "Tsukihime was my first Visual Novel, and the engaging story, well thought out world, and the cast of equally lovable and complex characters completely drew me in. The game came out in 2000, and is SUPER dated, with minimal and poor CGs, no voice acting, and no hand-drawn backgrounds. Like, they literally just took real-life images and placed a blue filter over them. Despite it's age and clear lack of budget, the sheer strength of the storytelling and characters massively outweighed the minor gripes I may have had. Tsukihime has undoubtedly become one of my favorite stories of all time, however as far as an anime adaptation goes, it seemingly has never received one, unfortunately. Or at the very least, the community would rather sweep it's mere existence under the rug. So, on to the main topic, what do I think of the infamous yet elusive Tsukihime anime? Honestly, despite what people say, this really isn't the worst thing to ever exist. It tries it's best to adapt some semblance of the Tsukihime story to the point where a newcomer might kind of enjoy this series just a little bit. However, what I can't ignore is how unfathomably insulting this series is when stacked up to the source material. First of all, it was basically doomed from the start when they gave it only 12 episodes. A 50-ish hour Visual Novel was definitely not going to fit in such a meager amount of time without cutting some corners, which they definitely did. They basically adapt Arcueid's route but try to cram in the plot twists from Ciel and Akiha's as well. Just about everything from Hisui and Kohaku's routes are 100% omitted, basically. That aside, this anime somehow manages to present itself poorly in almost every single aspect imaginable, which absolutely baffles me. The artstyle is terribly dull and ugly. The colors are drab, grey, and lifeless. The character designs are all adapted to look more \"serious\" and \"edgy\" and it completely falls flat when compared to their original designs, which are full of color and personality. I get that this shift in artstyle was likely done to preserve the crushingly dark tone of the series, but that can be done without making everything look as lifeless as a Dead Apostle. On top of this, the animation itself is absolutely atrocious. The \"action scenes\" if you can even call them that, are painful to watch. There's really only a couple instances where there's any fighting, but most of it is just really slow with as little movement as possible. There were approximately TWO scenes in this ENTIRE series where it looked like they kind of tried even just a little bit, and even then they are probably not much better than average. Every time the characters are even a meter away from the camera, they become indistinguishable meshes, and every little movement is just so painful, with absolutely zero impact or weight to any of it at all. It's hard to believe that this came out of J.C. Staff, considering that they produced Utena under their studio name just 5 years prior. Obviously, the studio behind the production definitely doesn't absolutely determine it's quality, but still, I would imagine there would be at least some level of quality control. Sure, this show came right at the beginning of the 2000s, when digital animation was still fairly new and people were still adjusting to it, so a certain level of jank is probably a given, but this is just too much. The original Hellsing, which came out two years prior, looks MILES better than this show, and people constantly rag on about how poor it's production quality was. I think there's a lot of similarities to be found in these two shows, actually. The old Hellsing, however, actually looks like it was made by people who care just a little bit. There's not much positive I can say about this anime, but hypothetically, if you had never heard of the Tsukihime Visual Novel and came across this anime, and were also able to get past it's copious and glaring production issues, you may find yourself enjoying the story at least a tiny bit. However, if you have not seen this and want to get into Tsukihime or Type Moon in general, this is not the way to go. \n\nEssentially, TL;DR, I would absolutely not recommend this series as your introduction to Tsukihime. If it was, I'm sorry, but I hope that any mild interest you may have picked up could lead you toward playing the Visual Novel. Hell, Tsukihime also has a manga adaptation that's actually pretty damn good. I would highly recommend either of those choices. If you're already familiar with Tsukihime and just want to watch this anime for educational purposes, (which I did) I can't say I'd really encourage that because it was pretty painful for me, and ultimately it didn't really feel worth it. Well, here's hoping that we get a ufotable Tsukihime anime once they're all done with Fate."}, {"id": 3440, "score": 45, "body": "*You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve probably already seen this movie but regardless, mild spoilers for the premise that truly reveals itself whole past the synopsis and maybe a few specific spoilers along the way*\n\nWhen most people think of Kimi no Na wa, they think of an simple emotionally gripping, beautifully animated masterpiece that touched them at their very core. When I think of Kimi no Na wa, I think of a tedious, convoluted, contrived, and ultimately misguided emotion-based time travel story blessed with wonderful visuals and cursed by its confusingly bad time travel narrative and equally hard to stomach main leads.\n\nI know, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a buzzkill. \n\nSo, why my cynicism? Before you try to answer, let me take two of them out for you. It has little to do with the fact that this movie is currently ranked #1 on MAL & Anilist, or the fact that this not only outsold every single Ghibli movie such as the insanely popular Spirited Away, or that it is the highest grossing anime movie of all time as of writing, though to be fair, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like I feel this film as truly earned any of that. With that being said, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s find out, shall we?\n\nSo now, a boy and a girl suddenly wake up from a dream, only to realize that their bodies have switched. I must say, right out the bat, I like the fact that each new day is told from the perspective of one of the two characters while switching perspectives to suit a new day in the beginning and that it starts on a character being explained to how she was acting weird, and putting two and two together allows us to see that this is the aftermath of one of these body-switching incidents that occur a lot throughout this movie. This is where the compliments of the story end for a while.\n\nHow long have these two been switching bodies? Given the montage especially, it's insanely hard to keep track, and I know it's all thanks to a comet, but I doubt a comet would remain visible for a small country like Japan for so long that the montage sort of hints at weeks of this happening? How come these characters start off thinking they're in a dream, even after feeling pain (especially given the whole gag cliche based around this exact trope of waking up after pain in a dream) and seeing the entire day go by in real time? I know full well that no dream lasts that long without entering at least one period of long, non-R.E.M. sleep (and R.E.M. lasts for about 15 minutes and that's when you dream, and dreams are never this coherent)? How come after so long, nobody tries to put two and two together about this whole thing with their own theories until the second half? Speaking of the second half\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\nThe second half is where this movie turns from just irritating to flat or convoluted and contrived. A comet from 3 years ago is seen 3 years later (I can't fathom how that's supposed to work, especially in such a short amount of time given a comet or a star) by these two main characters and that's what caused them to switched bodies with each other every day, and only them for no adequately explained reason, and that's a missed opportunity. We could've had scenes of some other people acting weird because of that too, though they would still need to explain it well beyond time travel-esque bullshit that doesn't explain anything. It turns out that two people end up, for no good reason, figuring it out: the grandmother of the girl, and the girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father. An explosion happens at one point in a major facility and no one considered that a  dangerous threat after being told that more of this can happen (though it's a diversion to evacuate the people from 3 years ago because apparently the comet splits and destroys the city that the girl was in, including her, meaning it would make no sense how she could connect with him, especially since the ending sort of rewrites that, which sort of changes the future but people can't do a good time travel plot for shit). The ending also just ends with the two sort of recognizing each other and then rolling to credits after panning up towards the clouds, so...that's something, I guess.\n\nI had to go back and research literally every character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name, they were that forgettable. It's not even like Rogue One where they either say most characters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 names once or not at all, they say these guys\u00e2\u0080\u0099 names constantly. This has never happened to me before for any anime. Let that sink in...and then realize how funny it is that the movie is translated as \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour Name\u00e2\u0080\u009d given these circumstances.\n\nTaki and Mitsuha are dense, extremely dense. I mean, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a bit of a dense person myself as anyone who knows me IRL for longer than a small bit will tell you, but these two are infuriatingly dense to the point of actual stupidity. There was the \u00e2\u0080\u009cdream\u00e2\u0080\u009d example from earlier but also, these guys constantly set rules for each other to not interfere much with their lives, only to constantly break them. They conveniently forget things for the sake of the plot, though to be fair, that's just the plot actively forcing them to forget things for no reason and not then being idiots, so back to that. When Mitsuha meets Taki in the emotional climax of the film, she straight up calls him an idiot over the fact that he often played with her tits when he woke up in her body...and this is the first thing g she says to him in the middle of an emotional climax. Not \u00e2\u0080\u009cI finally found you\u00e2\u0080\u009d or something befitting of such a scene where they first sorta meet each other truly within the little time they have before convenient BS makes it so they physically don't see each other anymore and proceed to go on their way to accomplish a necessary task, but \u00e2\u0080\u009cBaka\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Fucking really?\n\nIt's insanely hard to talk about any of the characters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 personalities since while outside of the protagonists, none of these are truly bad characters, they are insanely forgettable. I forgot everything about these people by the time I finished the movie, aside from the fact that Mitsuha's little sister doesn't like taking shit from people, and that she conveniently forgets something too (not even for plot convenience this time, just her being an idiot at one point in the final act). I genuinely cannot describe these people, and again, this has never, ever happened to me before! That is a cardinal sin for a movie so focused on pathos! So, fuck it; moving on!\n\nIf nothing else can be said, let it be known that this is one of the most gorgeous movies I've seen, at least from these recent years. CoMix Wave Films did an amazing job with the visuals and digital effects here, especially with the environment. Shoutouts to how jaw-dropping the comet was and how despite many shots being busy as hell, they all still look beautiful. The character designs are pretty bland (particularly Taki) but they are well animated, as you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d expect. The only other blunder to me was the fact that some moments looked insanely choppy with blatantly low frame rates in comparison to everything else, though as per usual, this is apparently fixed in blu-rays and cinemas (which sucks since most people can't watch it that way). It's like I started watching ACCA-13 for a few seconds at those points. Regardless, the film still looks amazing, even if the studio apparently ran out of budget for this film, and the fact that such a thing isn't noticeable at all is astounding, probably thanks to the admittedly good cinematography.\n\nThe OP, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYume Tourou (\u00e5\u00a4\u00a2\u00e7\u0081\u00af\u00e7\u00b1\u00a0)\" by RADWIMPS is a pretty decent OP theme that sets the tone well for the movie. The ED, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNandemonaiya (\u00e3\u0081\u00aa\u00e3\u0082\u0093\u00e3\u0081\u00a7\u00e3\u0082\u0082\u00e3\u0081\u00aa\u00e3\u0081\u0084\u00e3\u0082\u0084)\" by RADWIMPS isn't as good but is still a decent enough ED theme, though it is easily the weakest song in the movie. The OST is overall rather decent as well with alright and sometimes even kinda nice insert songs for some scenes in the movie (and nowhere else that tries to do the same thing). Nothing truly sticks out but even then, each insert track and background OST was of alright quality, though the insert tracks are definitely superior.\n\nFor a film about remembering, this film is awfully forgettable, especially in terms of its characters. As visually stunning as it is, I felt more annoyed that touched. This is easily the most forgettable film I've seen in quite some time, and it's not all that terrible but it's certainly not good in the slightest either from anything other than a visual perspective. Certainly not Number One anime film worthy, especially not when it's this contrived and unintentionally convoluted at time travel. I remember there was something about the director, Makoto Shinkai himself telling people to stop seeing this movie. He claimed that he didn't want people to see this as his magnum opus and for people to hold all of his films to that standard from now on, especially given the production issues that occurred towards the end. For me, I wouldn't know if this was his best film yet, but if so, then I both dread his current filmography and hope he surpasses this film. With all that said, I bid you adieu."}, {"id": 3451, "score": 19, "body": "Legends speak of a show that is considered to be one of, if not the absolute worst show of 2015. A show with such incompetent direction and CGI that frame rates slow down in the very first scene. A show with such uninteresting characters that their deaths are a loss to no one in the audience. A show so edgy and poorly written that it can only cause \"darkness-induced apathy\".\n\nYou know what they say about legends. There's always some truth to them.\n\n*Spoilers for Chaos Dragon*\n\nWhen you hear about an adaptation of a gaming session involving the likes of Gen Urobuchi of Fate/Zero and Psycho-Pass, Kinoko Nasu of the Nasuverse (Fate/Stay Night franchise, Shiki + Melty Blood, Kara no Kyoukai), and others, you can't help but wonder how the hell it'll turn out. It's based on a game session but it's a session from rather popular figures in the realm of anime, even if they're not Hideaki Anno. Unfortunately, the writer and the studio ducked up beyond belief and managed to ruin most of the fun that could've come out of something like that, even if there was nothing necessarily indicating that this anime would be good. Its status is almost legendary as one of the worst of 2015 and even the decade, with more people having seen it and calling it shit than Mars of Destruction, even if it's not as popular in its awful reputation as say, Big Order. So, what happened here? Well, let's find out, shall we?\n\nIn some island, Nii Kamui is overtaken by D'Natia and Kouran, and the king's son is in an orphanage, but then after people die, he ends up finding this relic that somehow gives him the ability to subconsciously communicate with Red Dragon (because fuck creativity in dragon names). He also gains a really stupid curse: every time he wants to use dragon power, he must kill someone he has a deep connection with and use that soul to eradicate someone else. I needn't mention why such a power is stupid and only there for needless drama, especially since it makes it so that the MC (Ibuki) is always whining about \"I love my friends and I won't kill any of them\". Seriously, when Fairy Tail is more subtle about friendship, we have a problem here, and Fairy Tail is synonymous with \"friendship trumps all\". In fact, people have random curses as they're born, like Sweallow's which make him break any tool he touches, except that by the anime's logic, walls and ships are also tools (because while the power wasn't stupid enough, they're basically calling literally every single object a tool, except somehow for his clothes because fuck consistency). I'll touch in what pisses me off the most about the powers later. Also, there are apparently 7 dragons (one for each kingdom I suppose) but we only see two of them: Red Dragon and Black Dragon, which are for Nii Kamui and D'Natia. We don't even see the one for Kouran, or any of the other dragons. \n\nSo, an ever-expanding group of flat, poorly-written, and unlikeable assholes (sans a few that only fit the first two categories) join up on an expedition and while the MC wants to find and reason with the now maddened Red Dragon, everyone else (sans two members) wants to kill Red Dragon, which could've created conflict on its own between some of the members of this anime knew how to manage them. They also throw magic into the mix but the only time weever see magic that has a magic circle to clue us into the fact that it's supposed to be magic (since nothing is ever directly classified as such) is when one imperial from Kouran creates a poorly edited blockade. Before you try to classify those soul-sucking weapons (like the one Koukaku has in episodes 1 and 2 if you remember her, or the sentient one that Lou has) as magic weapons, it's never directly stated or even hinted at. Then zombies, or rather \"returned ones\" show up,and where we get another issue that compounds itself the longer the anime runs. The start off as literal zombies minus the brain eating, but then one of the people Ibuki killed is conscious and able to speak (somewhat), and by the end, the final antagonist is also a returned one but with full consciousness and personality as well as a complete ability to speak as well as she did before, and we never know why.\n\nCharacters often make really stupid decisions, like one character actually stabbing himself, gouging his eyes out (or stabbing them with his fingers), and pretending to be a returned one just to get Ibuki to sacrifice him for the dragon since only loved ones and close friends can be sacrificed. Now, this is stupid enough but the part that makes this especially stupid is the fact that he and the main character hardly know each other or have any semblance of a bond, which is mandatory. As you could guess, that plan obviously backfired (since it honestly would've been beyond stupid, even by Chaod Dragon standards to let the sacrifice work). When one f the characters is clearly dying and having a hard time escaping rubble while the final antagonist is causing havoc, Ibuki doesn't let her sacrifice herself, and while ultimately it wouldn't have worked since Red Dragon is under the villain's control, he didn't know that at the time and it just seemed like a lazy way to have justified his idiotic behavior her can't even count as properly sentimental. If he was told earlier that this power wouldn't work for a while or if he tried it and failed which should make his friend live a while longer, then it would've been acceptable. Also, when he tried to say that that same friend shouldn't just be a sword for him as she's asking him if she is his to use (since she really wanted that), he frames it ina way that shits her down horribly rather than what he intended (that she shouldn't think herself of just a sword but more of a closed friend), and unlike say, Lelouch, who often words things poorly on purpose to either take blame or turn people against him, here, Ibuki just fucked up, which is emphasized by the fact that he manages to actually say it right in the finale episode.\n\nAfter a quick journey that could've been used to flesh it the characters, see then develop a bond of camaraderie with each other (but you know, that's what a good anime would do), it turns out that Ibuki's sister was alive the whole time. Yeah, remember the part where his family died and Nii Kamui was taken over and Red Dragon went insane, all before this expedition started? No? They only went through it every single episode after one scene in the beginning! Give other anime like Bakugan and Fairy Tail some credit; they do it at the very beginning before any OP or scene has a chance to occur rather than shoving a scene beforehand. But yeah, she survived and neither she nor Ibuki were reunited in 3 years since nobody had the bright idea to look, but that might be the leader, Agito's fault, seeing as he wanted someone to kill her after she made Red Dragon go crazy. Then again, seeing as how that required someone to have a contract with Red Dragon and assemble a team to stop her, why wasn't it done earlier? Oh yeah, because they died since instead of assembling a team to stop her, he wastes their time by making them go the  volcano where Red Dragon was. He makes the current group do the same thing too, and D'Natia sends their weakest imperial warrior first and only two more powerful soldiers way later since while they went to kill Red Dragon, I guess they're a bit lazy or something. Also, yeah, that sister is the main villain and she revived the first person Ibuki sacrificed; his love interest, and she dies a lot until she dies for good.\n\nBefore we get onto the topic of the paragraph's discussion, the reason Ibuki's sister, Inori, can revive her is because she has another artifact of Red Dragon, by this one revives people. Now, remember those curses? Well, apparently, the one Swaellow has is supposed to be part of this bullshit Aesop meant to say that it's human nature to shatter things like object or connections but that new ones are often formed in its place and that he should stay with this power. My response: \"Oh, FUCK YOU, ANIME!! You and your bullshit and inconsistently written curse BS that basically ruined a major character's life since childhood was to teach him an Aesop of human nature?! Fuck you, fuck whatever gave him the curse, fuck Black Dragon for not lifting it, fuck Swaellow for being a fucking moron and sticking with it, and fuck the writer for doing this bullshit!\" Oh, I still stick by that. It's beyond retarded. Also, after more nonsense and generic trash stuff and one of the characters betraying some of her allies, Ibuki kills his sister and she's revived and Ibuki becomes king. Also, Lou, the one who killed some of the other expedition members, gains that other artifact and then she walks off. The end. Of course I can't really hit every oddity in the series' writing, like Lou's badly done and borderline blatantly telegraphed heel turn, or like god when Swaellow's attendant blocks an object she shot out, it manages to hit him anyway despite the fact that he is literally behind his attendant who blocked the shot. Ether way, this is mkre than enough to really show how awful the writing of this show is. Now, for those bad characters I mentioned earlier.\n\nTo return to the cesspool of blithering idiots known as the characters, let's start with Ibuki. This brat is one of the most infuriatingly whiny protagonists I've ever talked about so far. He always whines about losing and not wanting to lose people he cares about due to his new power, but he never thinks to use his sword regularly and train so that he can actually defend people with his regular skills so that he doesn't have to get to the point of needing to sacrifice them to kill an enemy. It's not excusable by the fact that he is a child because even then, children would've often tried to get stronger so that this never would've happened, or he just would've ran, and he doesn't do either. He just whines the whole time but never actually tries to do anything to improve his situation so that what he fears may never happen again.\n\nEiha is beyond insistent on dying for this loser, and for no good reason. Her bodyguard devotion to him is her only real trait aside from being discriminated against for being a \"bounded one\" or one attached to a beast. Lou is easily the least terrible and one that could've been potentially amazing, but her personality is basically \"attractively creepy and badass\" while having a truly terribly done heel turn. It's probably a coincidence that the best character was made up by Gen Urobuchi. Sweallow (who looks strikingly similar to Gunvolt from the Azure Striker Gunvolt games) is a complete idiot who happens to have that awful curse and still be a badass, but that's his whole character. His attendant (Meryl) is an infuriating character who basically derides him at every turn and hits him, almost like a trash tsundere. Everyone else is either just one-note and barely there so they're not worth mentioning (like Koukaku and Ulrica), or are just idiots who deserve to die (like Kai and Hien), so the only one left to really mention aside from the shitbag 1D dragons is the final antagonist, Inori. God, what a butch. I get that kids can be terrible to each other and to authority sometimes, but they wrote her character to be so unrealistically deplorable and incestuous that it's quite frankly pathetic and downright edgy. All she does is do things for her brother or just be a total monster, and not even the entertainingly evil kind either. I don't feel like anyone else is even worth a paltry sentence of mentioning, so I'll just leave it here. What a shit show of a cast.\n\nLet's start with the character art. It looks like a weird, failed attempt to capture the art-style found in Studio Ufotable's adaptation of Fate/Zero and Unlimited Blade Works. Given that this isn't Ufotable, I'm right; it was done by Studio Connect and Studio Silver Link, the latter of which is mainly known for a few popular, if somewhat divisive titles like Chivalry of a Failed Knight, and WataMote. Then, we have the animation, which often looks like an animatic rather than animation given the number of frames that tend to be missing from many movements more advanced than walking. The choreography is awful too, especially in the early episodes. It sometimes becomes painfully obvious as to which scene was done by a different studio like in episodes 7 and 10 looking different in lighting and feel (as well as the wildly inconsistent sizes of Meryl's freckles). The characters often don't feel like they're connecting with the ground properly, especially when they end up rolling around via knockback, and it's rare when an anime gives off this vibe. Overall, actual animation is pretty poor at worst and mediocre at best, especially with the occasional reused footage which I thought died out this day and age, at least until two years later with a certain title that shall not be named\n\nThe CGI here is some of the absolute worst that I've seen in anime. Let's start with the goddamn Red Dragon. He looks like an animated version of some kid's over-designed action figure, and at times, they give him the ability to static out of existence. Every bit of movement has different frame rates as well, and it looks beyond ugly. You can apply a lot of this to Black Dragon as well. It's all hideous to look at, and the tentacle monsters summoned at episode 10 not only look terrible but when they die, they disappear into weird purple hoop CGI that fails miserably at being blood. Some backgrounds are literal live stock footage too, though that's surprisingly hard to notice. Still, it's unacceptable in any circumstances in today's time, or even two years ago when it came out. The CGI beetle-ship in the finale isn't any better. Hell, scene one of episodes 1 and 12 (since it's a repeat of the very first scene in episode 1) has a fugly ass CGI castle with abominable frame rate, and brings up memories I'd rather forget.\n\nThe OP, \"ISOtone\" by Natsumi Kon, is literally the only remotely noteworthy piece of music in this entire damn OST, and it's an alright OP. The ED isn't worth mentioning. Neither is the rest of this goddamn OST with how generic and forgettable it is. Worse yet, some of them can be repeated at nauseam, like the piano piece in episode 8 being repeated 4 times in that same episode. As for the dub, it's rather mediocre as well, and I cannot believe that they wasted Lanipator on this piece of crap show. Even Tia Ballard can't save this with how little her character appears, though it's not like these guys were doing that bad. It's just lame overall and the character models don't even feel like they work with the dub all that much. Also, some of these sound effects are goddamn awful, like with blood splatter sounding like when you get crushed and splattered in Happy Wheels.\n\nThis is easily one of the worst anime I've seen to date. It's not even memorably bad either; it's one of the most forgettable anime I've ever given such a negative rating to. It's terribly animated, the script is a mess, the characters are bland and/or idiotic, the CGI is fugly as hell, and nothing about this show is actually good; maybe a few things that are decent at best, but certainly not good. People were right in calling this dreck one of the worst anime of 2015. Well, with that said, I bid you adieu."}, {"id": 3455, "score": 40, "body": "As some of you may already know, I'm a big fan of Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion. Season 1 remains my favorite television series to date, and R2 was still pretty fun and equally ambitious. You can imagine how intrigued I was when I heard that it got a sub-series that was meant to explore some new territory in the lore of the franchise. After all, there is so much we don't know, like the origins of geass or what exactly happened between the 1-year gap between the events of R1 and R2, or even delving into the EU, which was never actually shown in the main series. Unfortunately, as you will see throughout this review, I was disappointed by it, in part due to one reason: Akito the Exiled has no ambition. \n\nThis film has no drive. It simply feels like an addition to a franchise rather than a brand new installment that explores uncharted territory. Whether or not you liked the original series, you have to admit that it had a lot of ambition. It tried to be fun, humorous, and nuanced at the same time, and it balanced each part well. Whether or not you think the attempt worked is up to interpretation. This doesn't have that, and it shows given how boring this slop is. \n\nIf there's anything I can compliment about Akito, it's that it treats the franchise with respect. It never does anything to jeopardize the continuity of the main series, and it expands on one key thing I wanted to know about: the EU. Also, the first half doesn't have many story issues. Simply, after a battle in which the only survivor is Akito, he needs up with one of his superiors, Leila (the one in charge of her main crew and the operation), and they head to a party in which he threatens a scumbag who was mistreating the one he is meant to guard (Lelia). Little goes on here aside from an action scene but that's alright; it's just the first 24 minutes.\n\nThe second half is what really killed the story. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this rebel trio who blows up their douchey superiors for seemingly no reason. I mean it, we don't know why they did that aside from possibly not wanting to take orders. Then, they attack or protagonists for seemingly no reason. Did they believe they were defenseless officials? Did they know those guys were armed and ready? We sure don't know what was going through their heads. They get captured by Leila (she never explains why she spared them), and then a guy killing his boss and potentially becoming an antagonist in the future. He grasses him, but we don't know what it does aside from the boss killing himself afterward. The lines of taking a trip don't help matters either. We end on Akito being edgy and saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cI died once\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that's a wrap. I know you can't really get much out of 50 minutes, no can you always put a lot into it, especially when it's introductory, but that's hardly an excuse for what happened here.\n\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start with Leila since she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the first MC we see. She's a bland \u00e2\u0080\u009crighteous princess and poor people activist\u00e2\u0080\u009d archetype that happens to know some self-defense techniques. Conversely, Akito is surprisingly malevolent, even by Code Geass standards, with his first scene showing him in a bloodthirsty rampage and many subsequent scenes having him sport the most wicked of evil grins. Other than that, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty standard, and the last scene really paints him as edgy. Neither of these two really have much to them, but they're better than the other characters who are literally archetypes as nothing else, like Leila\u00e2\u0080\u0099s older \u00e2\u0080\u009cbrother\u00e2\u0080\u009d or the geass guy towards the end who makes his master kill himself. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also the heavily enteric rebel trio who apparently want a place to belong, but their actions are clearly not indicative of that. What a dimensionless bunch.\n\nAs for the character art, while it is missing the shine that the characters in the original do, making these guys more akin to what comes out of Light Novels, their designs feel strictly \u00e2\u0080\u009cCode Geass\u00e2\u0080\u009d with the even more exaggerated version of the already exaggerative CLAMP style. Unfortunately, unless someone is disarming someone hand-to-hand, don't expect much to any movement with these characters. The most you'll usually get is a little bit of walking. Calling this animated is a formality at this point, at least for the characters.\n\nNow for the elephant in the room: the CGI. The CGI Knightmares tend to look terrible here, and are equally poor in terms of integration; some of the background vehicles aren't an exception either. The mecha designs mostly remain the same, but the new ones from the first battle are awful, especially the eyes that make the Knightmare that Akito pilots look non-threatening. I appreciate the detail that went into the mechs of the first battle, but it doesn't work that well. The mechs in the second battle look like they were ripped from a cel-shaded GameCube game from 2003, and it is also poorly integrated, chief among them being what one of the rebels fights to take out most of the soldiers surrounding Leila before Akito steps in. The CGI explosions look hideous as well. Hopefully, the subsequent films improve the CGI integration and Knightmare designs.\n\nThe directing in this film is also pretty terrible, especially for the action scenes. The camera looks like it was operated by a schizophrenic cameraman, which makes it difficult to process what's going on at times. Even outside of battle, sometimes the camera doesn't keep up that well, notably in one instance in the beginning before we heard back to the first battle. However, I do like the cockpit screens. Still, all in all, whenever there is actual animation, it's done with poorly integrated CGI mechs that we can't properly see fighting due to the camera, unlike in the original series. In fact, you'd think they'd be able to make even better fights on a 50-minute film than on a 25 episode television series (applied to either season of Geass) but I guess not.\n\nThe music was not done by Kotaro Nakagawa this time around, and it honestly shows. Someone else was in charge, and while the music does feel reminiscent of the feel of the amazing tracks of the main series, it's shockingly bland. There's this one piece with the crazy trumpets used in an action scene, but it doesn't fit well at all with either the action of the scene or the atmosphere surrounding it. The ED theme is also pretty bland, but EDs aren't really the franchise\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strong suit, unlike the OPs and OSTs, so I guess that's to be expected.\n\nUltimately, this was an unremarkable and poorly executed project, and I desperately hope this sub-series doesn't get much worse. Its characters are as dull and lifeless as its narrative, the action is terribly handled, and overall I'm left without a reason to care. Say what you will about the original series (and I have), but it always tried its damnedest to give you a reason to be engaged, whilst this right here is the epitome, nay, the embodiment of being sub-par! "}, {"id": 3463, "score": 26, "body": "*SPOILERS FOR CODE GEASS: BOUKOKU NO AKITO 2- HIKISAKARESHI YOKURYUU*\n\nImprovement is something that deserves recognition. When a series improves over time, that means that it is being written better, or that it was planned to reach higher levels of greatness as it went on. When a person improves, his attitude or actions change to be kinder, less self-centered, and less destructive. When art improves, that means the artist or whoever crafted the art honed his craft more so that everything would blend well with each other and look visually pleasing. When a film improves, that's because there is a new, more competent writer at the helm who can look at what happened and where best to go from here, or that the same writer as before did that exact thing. \n\nSad to say, nothing about what I just said applies to Akito the Exiled 2, with a minor exception to the third statement. In fact, practically everything regressed in this film. This film, while it feels more effortful and more driven than the previous installment, it somehow manages to be the dumbest installment of the franchise so far. It's full of edge, awful decision-making, and a lot of idiotic and plot-hole driven moments, and raises a potential knock against the continuity of the original (lest that one gets explained in later films). It offers nothing else, and I'm almost out of hope for this sub-series. So, what made this such a mess? Who do people praise this as the best film of the series? We both know you'll only find out the answer to the former question, but, well, let's find out, shall we?\n\nTaking place not long after the rebel attack in episode 1, Leila is assigned a new mission. Before that can happen, the rebel trio, once again, in fact, twice again (once during he mission) tries to kill her and Akito. By this point, any reasonable member of the military would either put a harsher restrain on them, punhsih them heavily, or flat out kill then. None of this happens because of course it doesn't; did you expect these characters to have brains? Shame on you. Afterwards, the crew launches into space to drop to their next mission. How they all managed to deal with the launch and being out of Earth's gravity for a while perfectly, without prior training for such an action, is beyond me. We also see enemies doing douche you things and coronation things while prepping for their mission, but who even cares? Still, that's only the first half; the second half is where things really hit the shitter.\n\nPrior to the mission, Leila tells the rebel 11's that she'll fight with them, and she even suits up. That makes it all the more damning when she literally does nothing the entire time. She doesn't shoot anyone or provide help for her allies. That's not the worst of the mission. You know how Akito has his bloodlust moment that is related to a geass? Well, somehow this links with the other members of the team aside from Leila. One, this was never shown to be possible in Code Geass; for the effects of one's geass to sync with others' minds through some crazed pseudoscience. Two, why isn't Leila affected? Theee, this geass came from Xin, and it makes people die, but now not only did Akito survive it (begging the question of how he died if he's alive right now, over 10 years after the incident of his \"death\"), but that's what infects the others, again, excluding Leila. None of this makes any remote sense whatsoever, and I could go on and on about some of the other dumb things like how Xin doesn't bother finishing Akito off when he wants to kill him, but you get the point by now and then it would just resort to bloated nitpicking. Whatever; both sides retreat and no one remotely important died or had any reason for us to care even if they did. The end.\n\nLeila, while beautiful, is both better and worse in this film. She's better in the fact that she is being a bit more than a typical \"righteous princess who sympathizes\" and is actually trying to fight, even though some of those in that archetype do that as well. Problem is, she basically lied about that since she doesn't even fire a single bullet in the fight against the enemy, producing next to no support for her comrades. The most infuriating part was when she had Xin in her sights but didn't bother shooting him or his knightmare when he had Akito effectively at his knees. Also, I wonder if she ever found her car that she was looking for during the first half of her film. Akito is the same as ever, but we get to flesh him out a bit more in the fact that it was his brother that told him to die, somehow giving him this bloodlust geass effect. Other than that, nothing else was done with him aside from having a new rival, who I'll get to.\n\nNow we actually get to talk about the rebel 11's trio and mention them by name! Ryou and Yukia are generic crazy evil people who have different skills but that's really it. They keep trying to backstab our protagonists and don't face any punishments other than \"foiled again\". Ayano at least had the fact that she does things out of anger and revenge, but that's the entirety of her character. This reminds me of the Trinity trio from Gundam 00, only a million times worse since those guys had a personality that went beyond one trait. For the real villains, the only two of note are Ashley (yes, that is a guy but he has a girl's name), who is Akito's bloodthirsty rival from this point onward who rags in about luck on the battlefield, and Xin, our generic antagonist in every way imaginable. We saw glimpses of that in movie 1, but it's all but confirmed here that he is one of the most generic villains ever conceived. Also, Suzaku from the original series makes a brief cameo in this movie, along with Julius Kingsley, who we all know is basically Lelouch except dehydrated and with new memories. They obviously don't salvage anything from this disaster of a cast.\n\nRemember when I said the designs didn't have that sleek shine to them in movie 1? Well, they luckily brought it back, though the completing last time was pedantic if nothing else. Either way, there's somewhat more movement this time around for the actual characters, but that's about it. The CGI Knightmares are as bad as ever but with noticeably worse framerate this time around. The direction is just as awful for action scenes with the camera, too. The design for Ashley's knightmare is pretty cool, especially with the swords, but the one for Xin's is an abomination, excluding the ridiculous horse. It's a shame the detail on these goes to waste with poorly integrated CGI anyway. CGI explosions and smoke don't help matters either. Effectively, only the most minuscule of improvements to elevate the loom from terrible to regular bad. Also, the knightmares that Akito and co. pilot are still hideous as sin.\n\nThere's little to speak of in the music department either. The OST is literally the same and with no additions whatsoever, and we even got the same ED. It's all just as generic and poorly integrated as ever and there is literally nothing to say about this OST. You'd think they'd put at least 1 new track for us to notice but I guess not. At this rate, I'm just showing a filibuster because I don't want this section to have less than 5 lines of text. Let's just move on, this review almost over anyway...\n\nThis was strike two for the Akito the Exiled sub-series. The characters nonsensically regressed, nothing made sense, almost nothing improved whatsoever, and I'm basically repeating myself at this point. I've covered just about everything from this 1-hour film that was remotely worth talking about. \"Best in the series\" my ass!"}, {"id": 3469, "score": 40, "body": "Shinsekai Yori had a case of not knowing what precisely it wanted to be. It was an action show aimed at teenage boys, a political thriller for the older crowd and a philosophical drama for those who want to think. Except it failed to deliver on all of these promises. A significant amount of this is due to the poor characters, though the plot was decent for the most part.\n\nCharacters:  \nSaki, being the main character, severely disappoints with her constant passivity. She is rarely proactive which means that other characters always have to drive forward the plot. This includes Satoru, Shun, Kiroumaru and Squealer. She has very few defining character traits other than being very self-preserving and resilient. The only sequence where Saki drives the plot forward is when they are searching for someone, of which they do twice, and the sequences accomplish nothing other than provide us with nice scenery to look at. Her decision in episode 24 to burn the Psycho Buster in order to save Satoru from a chemical death is downright idiotic and illogical on every level. Not only does this keep the 'ogre' alive so it could potentially kill more people, but does nothing to save Satoru from her. Very fortunately for her, this pays off, but to make such a huge idiotic decision and not have the show comment on it one bit, aside from words of reassurance for Saki, which also makes no sense, detracts from her character immensely. If she were both self-preserving and logical she could have created a wall in front of Satoru whilst the 'ogre' suffered a chemical death, which would have ended the conflict immediately and saved Satoru's life. It is worth noting that Saki's character, although the story spanned almost 15 years of time, never changed or developed as a character. She stayed the same until the very end, where she was ruined. She also talks to the deceased Shun 10 years after he died to figure out plot details which would otherwise have been very difficult to know.\n\nSquealer and Kiroumaru stand out as characters in the wrong show because they are charismatic, intelligent, and honourable in their own ways. Squealer progresses from a slimy servant to a glorious military leader rivalling Kiroumaru himself. Kiroumaru is the embodiment of honour, but it is revealed late in the series that he plotted a rebellion against the humans because they could have been destroyed by them at any moment. Squealer's motivations are very justifiable; fighting for the liberation of monster rats and equality of rats and humans. His experiences in the first arc of the series shape his strategy and actions in the 3rd arc where he declares war on the humans. Kiroumaru and Squealer stay true to their principles to the very end, and they do not waver in the face of death. Kiroumaru fights with the humans out of loyalty to them, even though his loyalty is not unconditional. Squealer fights for all rats in order to provide them with better lives. They are admirable characters, unlike everyone else in the show, who is either a redshirt or suffers from supreme stagnation. It is not difficult to see why these are characters are the best part of the show.\n\nEveryone else was mostly insignificant. We barely got any screentime of Shun, and so his purpose was to trigger an epiphany in Saki, however the memory wipe the episode after delays this for a very significant time, thus negating the consequences of his death for a few episodes. Mamoru and Maria were uninvolved with the plot to the point where their daughter, who has 0 lines that aren't screaming, is more relevant, more important, and drives the plot forward. Even she is not a character, though, she is a character-less enemy. Redshirts include Inui, Rijin, Kaburagi, the crazy monk dude, and countless other citizens. Tomiko is an interesting one because she does such evil things, like killing children and controlling every aspect of human life, out of fear that an apple with go bad and ruin everything. Her interests are in preservation of humans at the cost of freedom, progress, and humanity. This is contrasted well against Squealer, who is progressive and constantly advances his tribe even if it is highly dangerous for them all. Satoru is barely worth mentioning. When you see him in episode 5, that is his character and it never changes throughout the series. He makes rash decisions, and is still naive, especially during the hospital sequence where he doesn't want to realise what threat they are up against.\n\nPlot: \nThe plot was the best thing about this show, though it wasn't anything better than 'good'. The first arc contains eough events, however, they are all placed at the end, leaving the first 4 episodes almost eventless. The first few episodes are used entirely to set the scene and infodump, rather than to develop the story. The introduction of the rat conflict and rat politics was a benefit, but having to watch humans play a large role in this detracted, especially since Satoru just killed everything. First arc has a decent conclusion, though in classic A1 fashion, there is unnecessary explanation to establish this conclusion. There are a lot of dropped plot elements, such as the characters who go missing who are given 1 sentence of information 10-15 episodes later.\n\nThe second arc is bad. Almost nothing happens. They go looking for people for at least 4 episodes. Episode 10 contained Shun's death and some infodumping, and provided conclusion to his part of the story, which wasn't much, albeit good, transitioning the show into the next segment. The infodumps during Shun's death episode provided enough information for his issue, but didn't particularly affect the main plot in any significant way. Then the plot convolutes and starts to introduce plot holes, such as memory wipes. Use of such memory wipes in addition to sealing of power would allow the Ethics Committee to solve basically every problem that arises with children, thus rendering cats unnecessary unless they become really bad. There's a once-off character whose role was to replace Shun but he had no relevance to anything and was forgotten immediately after. The Mamoru search showed some snowy scenery, but ultimately meant little. The Maria search showed the same scenery, and also added little apart from setting up the next arc and leaving Satoru and Saki on their own.\n\nThe third arc is better, but spends far too much time focusing on the humans who have not changed since the beginning, and nowhere near enough time on rat conflict and rat politics. There are a decent few episodes where Squealer is effectively likened to the Tywin Lannister of the show, and his battle strategy against the humans appears to be quite effective, but the actual damages are never shown or mentioned at all. The lack of shown consequences makes the attacks on human settlement feel insignificant when they shouldn't. The 'ogre' was a good introduction, but instead of utilising existing characters, a new one was created specifically for the role, and for the zero lines they say, they have more of an impact on the story than Shun, Mamoru and Maria combined. A seemingly unbeatable threat upped the stakes, which was good for tension, and it remained this way until they introduced the cop-out that is the Psycho Buster: a magic solution that will solve all of their problems. This undermines the abilities of the humans and instead of letting them fight and win on their own merits, acts as a way for the plot to grant an out the the losing faction. The Tokyo exploration episodes could have had good scenery, but it was just desert and caves, which was a missed opportunity. Yet again, Shinsekai Yori becomes a searching simulator as they look for the Psycho Plot Convenience. This isn't as bad as the previous searches, though, because it is their goal they are pursuing, not insignificant side characters that don't do anything useful. The intentional sabotage of the Psycho Buster by Saki when they could have won may have ruined Saki's character, but it served the plot by allowing the humans to come up with a solution of their own merits. The actual solution is given to Saki by Shun, who died 14 episodes prior, and even though is a figment of Saki's madness, reveals important details to Saki that she either should have known herself (thus strengthening her character) or should have figured out. Being told how to beat the 'ogre' reflected poorly on her character and the plot. Kiroumaru's sacrifice was well executed (pun intended) and served as a consequence for Saki's actions. \n\nThe final episode concluded on a low note. The bad guys won, oppression and tyranny would continue, freedom was crushed. But instead of being solemn, the show maintains a neutral stance. This neutrality does serve to let the viewers decide who they feel was righteous, but it was so obviously the rats, that this could almost be considered a negative point (it isn't, though). The decision of the human council to punish Squealer made sense, and his eventual release from torment was a good conclusion to his story, however, the show mostly ended off as it began; with an oppressive and tyrannical society that controls every aspect of human life. There is indication that the humans have undergone some cultural change regarding freedom of thought, but the rats are still considered subhuman and were all exterminated, save Kiroumaru's colony.\n\nSound and art/animation: \nVoice acting was of standard quality, with standout performance by Squealer's VA. The OST was mostly forgettable, though not bad, with only one track being good. It set the scene on most occasions, but sometimes ruined the atmosphere, like during the confrontation with an imprisoned Squealer. Really not notable. It suffered from a lack of diversity in tracks and used the same ones over and over even if they didn't fit the mood of the scene.\n\nThe art style was a weird shoujo style, the scenery of some of the towns that were visited was nice, but the directing was inconsistent, especially camera angles that often focused on Saki's rear when it was inappropriate for the scene. Episodes 4 and 10 were directed very poorly, but the floating bars of soap in Shun's area were quite amusing to look at. Animation quality was inconsistent. Rarely it was high quality, usually was mediocre, often bad. Lighting was good most of the time.\n\nOverall: \nThis is a very messy show which has the misfortune of being created around intriguing ideas. That makes it more disappointing that this is bad."}, {"id": 3470, "score": 30, "body": "Makoto Shinkai's latest work goes even further to support the theory that he's fantastic at directing a visually brilliant movie, but lacks the writing ability to tell a good story.\n\nPlot:\nAn absolute mess. Without spoiling it, this movie fails to get into the main plot until roughly halfway through. Before that point, it views like a teenage slice of life; nothing to be disappointed by. After the halfway mark, the plot becomes incredibly contrived with no logic, reason, or thought put into its creation. There were at least 4 separate climaxes (which is inexcusable for any movie which is not Return of the King) and an overly drawn out epilogue sequence. The main climax happens off screen, which negates the entire build up to it, because Shinkai wanted to have a reveal with little weight. There are an unacceptable amount of plotholes, mostly due to the concept of Musubi. There's little coherence, and amateur directing/writing displayed frequently throughout. To differentiate this from his other movies, Shinkai infused supernatural elements with romance, which fails horribly at enhancing the movie and instead detracts very significantly. Even amongst the people who love this movie, there is a large percentage that find the plot messy. \n\n\nArt/Animation:\nIt's Makoto Shinkai. If movies were judged by aesthetics alone, this would be one of the best ones. There are no issues with the art. Scene composition is mostly great, the animation was very high quality, and the art style was beautiful. While there are not as many wallpaper opportunities as in 5cm/s, the quality of them is significantly higher. Watch this in the highest possible quality you can find. Worth watching for the art alone. The animation is what you'd expect from a high budget movie, but it's not anything revolutionary. There are several scenes that move beautifully and feel like magic to look at. The animation quality isn't quite up to Ghibli standards but it is nothing to scoff at.\n\n\nSound:\nVoice actors were quite good and played different roles effectively. The change in voice aesthetic was notable during the first half. The soundtrack was unmemorable, but set the scene adequately, and it may help to broaden your horizons and expose you to new music. Sound FX and general background noise was well produced and sounded natural. The opening sequence song in particular stood out and is worth a listen, but I can't say that for most of the soundtrack.\n\n\nCharacter:\nThe mains were adolescents, which meant there was a lot of adolescent stuff going on in the first half. The characters were interesting initially, though none stood out as incredibly well written and became less and less captivating as the movie went on. The main positive about the characters was that they mostly felt natural, save for when they were clearly not meant to. Side characters were certainly more natural than the mains, and contributed well to the atmosphere of the movie. They develop plot stupidity and have no depth or drive other than the forced romance, and plot amnesia is introduced for added gratuitous drama. There is no reason for the characters to become stupid, or amnesiacs, and it detracts from the believability of the characters and the plot.\n\n\n\nBuy this on bluray because it looks stunning. Don't expect good characters, or a remotely good plot, but do expect to salivate at another of Shinkai's wallpaper opportunity movies. Worth the watch for the visuals. It's an awful movie that looks good."}, {"id": 3471, "score": 40, "body": "Devilman: Crybaby is the first show to be completely released this year, due primarily to Netflix's all-at-once method. It aired in the Winter season of 2018 and has 10 episodes. It's a complete adaptation (read: adaptation, not 1:1) of Go Nagai's 1972 Devilman manga. The premise is about a man who becomes possessed by a devil while keeping control of himself in order to fight the growing demon menace that is threatening mankind. Devilman first became popular because it was the first manga at the time to be so violent and graphic, with lots of sexual content. The anime adaptation changes a lot from the manga to the point that only the core plot points are similar. The director, Masaaki Yuasa, has been known for his unique directing style and made great use of it once again in this show.\n\n\nQuality\n\nIt would not be possible to talk about Crybaby without mentioning how it changed so much from the manga. There is a lot of modernisation, like the use of cameras, smartphones, social media, etc. This was similar to how Parasyte, set in the 80s, was transformed into a mid 10s setting. The best part of the modernisation is that the bland tough guys from the manga become a rap gang who are quite impressive at their art. The most noticeable changes, other than the character designs, are that the show has a lot of track racing. This acted as a way to characterise Akira and Miki, of whom received little characterisation in the original manga. We are shown a bit more of Akira before he becomes Devilman, which was a significant improvement because the manga began with an infodump between Ryo and Akira. All of the relevant characters in Crybaby have some personality to be distinct, but their personalities can be described in one or two sentences.\n\nThe plot takes mostly the same turns as the original, but with the added track racing there is another level to develop the story. Most scenes regarding Miki are new, including the photoshoot related scenes, and they act to display degeneracy, of which comes tumbling down at the end. Considering how bland Miki was in the source material, all of these changes are welcome, but Miki is still not compelling. The manga liked to throw everything at you at once, but the anime takes a slower approach. A complaint people had about the adaptation was that it minimised the roles of some of the demon enemies, however, one of the characters they complain about was hardly relevant in the manga, and the other had changed scenes to increase the emotional impact. I have no complaints about any of the changes because they are logical and make the story and show better as a result. This is not to say the plot has no issues, because it has many significant ones. Crybaby seems to move at a very fast pace towards the end and doesn't take the necessary time to justify a lot of what happens. Many plot points were created for the sake of shocking the audience, which diminishes its value. Compared to the manga, however, this is still an improvement because it was also very rushed at the end and didn't take any time to justify what happened. The manga was bad schlock, the anime is alright schlock. Schlockfests like this are uncommon, and what we usually get is poorly produced.\n\nSince Crybaby is a Masaaki Yuasa work, it would be an insult to not praise his directing. The art style might seem weird and the running animation is positively goofy, yet this is all part of Yuasa's charm. Yuasa is clear with what he is conveying because he is a visual director. He gives information off with the slightly drugged up visuals rather than via infodumps ala the manga. His directorial changes led to a far greater payoff for certain scenes, and one particular scene with Miki's Christian father later on in the show that he made was one of the best moments of the show. Yuasa improves upon the original with this adaptation. The theme exploration is shakily done and this adaptation muddies the waters a bit more than the \"War is evil\", \"Nukes will destroy the world\", \"Humans were evil all along\". There are also a lot of Christian themes, most of which are well presented and none of which stoop to the level of Evangelion, which used religious imagery and symbolism because it looked cool instead of being substantial. The iconic ending has a neat concept behind it, but is very poorly executed due to the rushed plot.\n\n\nEntertainment Factor\n\nThe main reason you should watch Devilman: Crybaby is for the entertainment. There's a lot of violence, a lot of R-rated sexual content, a great soundtrack, and fluid animation. The original Devilman became popular because it was the first manga to push the boundaries so much and become edgy. Crybaby acknowledges this and delivers even more sex and gore. Very schlock. Quite haram at points. Not recommended as a romantic show to watch with your wife because she'll probably hate it or start crying at all the gore and horror elements, but if you have some mates you want to spend a 4 hour night with, grab a six pack and enjoy the night.\n\nSome people might take issues with Yuasa's art style or dopey animation, but I see that as part of the fun and a great reason to watch Devilman. I first became interested in this show because I saw Yuasa's name attached, and a lot of people became interested because it was part of the Devilman franchise. The plot is quite basic and the themes are messy, but for people who like Transformers, Fast and Furious and Evil Dead, this is a good pick.\n\n\nOverall Message\n\nThe original Devilman slapped on a \"War is bad, humans are bad\" message onto an insubstantial story, but Crybaby attempts to weave the themes into the story a bit more than this. There's a moral dilemma late in the show with Miki's Christian father, but that is ultimately insignificant, although well done, in a sea of gratuitousness, violence and degeneracy. \"Humans can be terrible\" is a very juvenile outlook on humanity, one shared by edgy teenagers. Not to be taken seriously. \"War is bad\" is a more mainstream message but it's slapped on just like in the manga. Some collateral damage is shown, but the \"humans are bad\" idea gets in the way of the anti-war message by implicating humanity in crimes, degeneracy and slaughters. The ending tries to suggest that God will punish the evil in this world, but the show rushes through the ending sequence so much that it's hard to take any message seriously. Devilman Crybaby should be considered devoid of any meaningful message, despite the Christian undertones of some sort of Revelation/Noah's Ark.\n\n\nShould you really watch Devilman: Crybaby?\n\nNo. No you should not."}, {"id": 3473, "score": 30, "body": "Made in Abyss aired in the Summer season of 2017 and ran for 13 episodes; the last occupying a double time slot. It's about children who delve into a great chasm called \"The Abyss\" in order to find treasures to sell in order for their village to profit. The protagonists embark on a quest to find information about the main girl's mother.\n\n\nQuality\n\nMade in Abyss is very misleading about a lot of things, but none so much as the quality of the show. The world shows much promise when it is introduced, but instead of answering the questions we have about the Abyss, the village they live in, the surrounding countries that trade with the village, and the inhabitants of the Abyss, we are left with more questions. The total lack of explained depth of the world is a big mark against the show since, although the premise sounds great, very little substantial detail is provided. Although the world building is mediocre at best, the plot keeps itself above the line and is intriguing enough to justify the slower pace.\n\nThe characters range from quite good to insultingly poorly written. Riko is a run of the mill child protagonist that keeps wanting to push further than she is capable of. She does get punished, which makes for an interesting turn in the plot, though the gratuitousness is similar to Evil Dead levels which detracts from the immersion. Reg is a walking plot convenience device. He can conveniently do literally everything that he is demanded by the plot to do, ranging from infinitely extending arms, an overpowered blast cannon with a minor downside, a near unbreakable body, and resistance to the curse of the Abyss. Since he also conveniently has plot amnesia, he is a lazily written character and nothing to be impressed by. The only impressive characters didn't have a large part. Ozen, who appeared halfway through, was plenty interesting and Bondrewd, appearing in the last episode, was a good charismatic villain. Nanachi is nothing to write home about, but nothing all that bad. She doesn't do much other than help the cast and have a sad backstory.\n\nPresentation, in contrast to the weak characters and bad world building, is excellent. Made in Abyss was the best looking show in its airing season and one of the best this year. Kinema Citrus hasn't made a good looking show since Barakamon. The soundtrack was very appropriate and well made. There are several tracks that stand out. Kevin Penkin did most of the composition and was the correct choice for the show. His style is contemplative and artsy without sounding obnoxious, and uses the orchestra often enough to appeal to fans of orchestral music.\n\n\nEntertainment Factor\n\nIf a show is lacking in quality, like Made in Abyss is, entertainment factor can be redeeming enough to make a show worth watching. If you enjoy watching cardboard cutouts make their way down a dangerous, large hole that has pretty backgrounds Made in Abyss is for you. If you want something wholesome, Made in Abyss is not for you. A potential turn off is the gratuitous gore, abuse and fetishisation of innocent seeming children. Riko is wearing nothing fairly often in the show, Reg gets his genitalia inspected at multiple points during the show and there are a few scenes where children suffer in extreme ways, resulting in death some of the time.\n\nHowever, the last episode, which involves children suffering, is the most entertaining part due to the charismatic and lawful evil villain. This episode also happens to have the least amount of Riko and Reg, which is a factor in it being enjoyable. Sadly, even in this episode children are fetishised which detracts immensely.\n\n\nOverall Message\n\nThe short length (13 episodes) makes it hard to determine exactly what the message is. It seems to be that if you surround yourself with strong people that you will be able to work towards your goals effectively. This message is a selfish one, but accurate and not a bad takeaway. Bondrewd's episode has the message that progress at all costs isn't necessarily a good thing, but the rewards can be alluring despite the atrocities that need to be committed in order to obtain them. These are good messages, but they can hide the truth about this show.\n\nPerhaps the most important takeaway is that although Made in Abyss looks like an alright show on the surface, there is a dark truth: it fetishises children and the author is a pedophile. This explains why many things happen in the show and presents them in a potentially different light. The target audience clearly isn't children due to the gory and violent nature, which means it's for teens and adults. The teens may be impressed by the edgy turn the plot takes, but there's nothing that an adult would like unless they're a creep that likes watching children suffer, or be fetished. Made in Abyss is a fetish show for creeps which passes itself as an edgy suffering trip for the youths and the people willing to sweep the disturbing truth under the rug. It's not a well written show, and it's not a worthwhile show. The entertainment value isn't nearly high enough to justify watching a degenerate show made by a pedophile.\n\n\nShould you really watch Made in Abyss?\n\nNo. No you shouldn't."}, {"id": 3474, "score": 10, "body": "Sin the Movie is the best worst movie you've never seen.\n\nIt adapts an unsuccessful first person shooter game called Sin that tried to compete with the original Half Life. Video game adaptations are known to be terrible and Sin is no exception. Nothing makes sense. Nothing is explained. And this is what makes Sin the Movie the best of the worst movies.\n\nIt begins with John Blade, JC and some rando going into a sewer because reasons. JC is then killed by a sewer alligator, I think. Because reasons. John Blade yells \"JC\" and the scene cuts to a funeral. Some old guy mumbles pretentious dialogue to John Blade and nobody cares what he says. JC's sister, whose name can be abbreviated to JC, requests to see John Blade, but since she is probably unimportant we can skip ahead a couple scenes.\n\nTim, who is a normal man and the self-insert of this movie, ends up being killed by a monster similar to the sewer alligator that killed JC. The plot thickens, but not really because it doesn't make any sense. This little girl that John Blade rescued from somewhere has some connection to a monster, I think, it's pretty unclear. \n\nSeveral scenes later, some evil corporate overlord woman called Sinclair is doing evil corporate things with this evil corporate man named Vincenzo Manchini. John Blade and his crew invade the tower because they kidnapped the little girl and John Blade makes sure to bring his cancer bullets to shoot the sewer alligator monsters. John Blade kills Vincenzo Manchini and the evil corporate woman Sinclair, rescues the little girl, then they escape out of the tower on an aircraft. The end.\n\nThe movie looks terrible because the art director must have been going through an edgy phase and put in too many dark colours. Most of the movie takes place at night and the animation team didn't give a rat's ass about making anything look smooth. There's one single scene where a sewer alligator mutant soldier runs very quickly at a lot of tanks that looks hilarious and that's the only good bit. It's visually hard to follow what's going on and the subtitles don't make it any easier. The plot is impossible to understand because not even the writer knew what he was doing. It's a hackjob of an adaptation and you'd have to hunt down a copy of the game to try and understand where this fits in. The voice acting is spectacularly stupid and done by people who have gone on to be quite successful.\n\nNothing could be as hilariously poorly done as Sin the Movie.

The Akito sub-series is already filled to the brim with utterly ridiculous moments in the first two films alone, but this movie takes it up to endearing levels of stupidity, despite what it does to the series' canon and how it makes the whole geass stuff even more convoluted than ever before. People claim that this was the start of the fall of the series when, honestly, it was horrible to begin with. All of the same problems (except bad CGI because it's improved here) are on full display, like dumb character decisions, poor usage of Geass in terms of justifying it and how it works, edgy writing and MC, and bland characters (though the main protagonists are far less dull here). However, the writer managed to become even dumber than before which is quite an accomplishment, and the pacing really ruins itself. \n\nAbsolutely nothing makes sense in this movie. Somehow, our military protagonists get financially locked out and unable to get into their military building and then a group of old ladies tries to hustle the group, and then the group works for them for a while. We don't know how we got to this point. We also learn plenty of backstories, like for Akito, Leila, and that one scientist lady who keeps her lover in some kind of stasis in hopes of him recovering, however, each of these backstories is rushed beyond belief, making it hard to process them. The pacing of this movie is terrible because of that; things rarely get to breathe and flesh themselves out properly. We then see Julius, Shin, SpinZaku, and others coming together, and then Julius enacts his fake terrorism plan, and it works. After a game of chess against Shin, we see him flip out after saying \"your majesty\" because somehow that triggers his actual memories as Lelouch now despite him saying it a lot beforehand. He flips out, passes out, and Shin tells them that he killed him (though he obviously didn't, since if he did, R2 couldn't exist), as well as some stuff shot killing people we never heard of and this Euro-Britannia stuff we never heard of until minutes prior in this film with no explanation of what it is. Then this weird geass lady shows up from the TV somehow to tell Gene Smilas what to do, and we end on a hokey fist fight. What a mess. Things are just thrown in there with no proper explanation and the pacing goes far too fast. It only added more problems to the already broken Akito narrative and has potentially jeopardized the continuity of R2.\n\nAside from boring Akito, the other 4 major protagonists actually get to show off their fun side, even if it makes the rebel trio in particular feel like completely different people if not for their singular trait from before that occasionally appears. Ayano has the biggest personality change, and it all comes out of left field, though for her, it compliments her beauty more. Let it not be said that these three aren't more likable and that they aren't less generic now, because they are. The lightning-fast pacing doesn't let the backstories tell themselves well either, especially for Leila. Plus, the gypsies are annoying and not well written. Now to the other side of this conflict. Julius is pathetic. He's just an arrogant man who goes crazy for the most ludicrous of reasons and is reduced to someone pathetic, almost like a sick parody of the man he was in the TV series. His plan is compared to what the real Lelouch did despite him never doing something like that in the original series, and I can't explain why he is so pathetic about water. Shin is every bit as one-note as ever, but it's interesting to see how the other guys are dicks to him behind his back. We luckily only get to see the badass side of Suzaku and not the abhorrent and hypocritical side of him, but he can't help much. Then we get this hot but disturbingly one-note lady of Geass who we know nothing about, in the second to last scene of the film and apparently we don't see her again in the next one. Just...why?\n\nYet with everything I said, it seems like the movie did learn something, as its visuals are a massive step up from the previous movies. For one, the characters move quite a lot, at least thrice as much as the first two films combined, which shouldn't have been as big a relief as it was. Also, the CGI in the second half of the film has vastly improved, notably in the battle between Suzaku and Shin's forces. Sure, they would look more appropriate in a PS3 video game, but the CGI is far more fitting for a mech given how metallic they all look now, like the kickass Lancelot. Sure, the action directing still needs work, but everything, including the looks and effects of geass, is a major step up from before. Still doesn't beat the original series, but hey, it's still better than what came before, including the CGI in the first half of the film.\n\nThere's a surprising number of new songs in the first 40 minutes, and they work much better and are more varied than the other ones. Unfortunately, we still have to put up with the other generic tracks and the generic ED, and even the new tracks don't stick out, but there's at least some flavor coming from these new tracks, flavor that actually fits, unlike the flaring trumpets track. It's a step up here as well, and I hope to hear more interesting tracks from this sub-series in the future, especially since it makes the OST actually have its own identity for once instead of just sounding like a lamer version of the main series' OSTs.\n\nI wonder why people call this film worse than the other two and the start of Akito's decline. It's not much worse than the awful second film in terms of writing, and there's actually a sense of charm here, even if most of it came from unintentional hilarity. Is it because the first half felt weird and out of place? Perhaps, but it at least had characters actually doing things and actually trying to get more fleshed out. Is it because it's boring? I'd disagree and say that the first film is far more boring, but hey, opinions. However, you can't really say the series is starting to get dumb since it has always made absolutely no sense, especially during the second film. It's just that the ball of suck keeps rolling, even if this time around, it manages to be enjoyably terrible. Plus, the CGI and music improved, and there is actually a lot of character animation. Perhaps an in-depth discussion can lend me some insight, but for now, this is as entertaining as this sub-series has been so far, quality notwithstanding."}, {"id": 3478, "score": 44, "body": "*Spoilers for Boukoku no Akito 4 - Nikushimi no Kioku Kara*\n\nIt's at this point that I realize that there's no hope for this sub-series whatsoever. There's no way it can salvage its convoluted and contrived excuse of a story, nor can it salvage many of its generic and poorly written characters. Both this film and the last film did things that jeopardize R2's ability to canonically exist, and the series as a while as inadvertently damaged the integrity of the franchise with its terrible main character, awful new script, and lack of charisma. It doesn't really feel like Code Geass, nor does it feel like a worthy entry to it. This is the second to last film in the sub-series, and nothing aside from the CGI, animation, and OST has improved to any significant degree. It's cheesy, trite, and laughable. So, why does it have a higher score than the rest of the films? Yet, like the last one, at least the ride was entertaining in how wrecked it was.\n\nBasically, Akito and crew end up in an abandoned ship in which they are attacked by Ashley and his drones, except Ashley can't shoot for shit despite having 6 giant machine guns strapped onto his Knightmare. For some reason, he wants revenge for Johanna, a guy that not only get bullied by Ashley, but sacrificed himself for him in the name of war and saving his superior officer. Obviously, revenge is moot in this case, and obviously, Akito takes him down, but not before the blood-lust geass effect controls him and the others before they somehow snap or of it and make him stop via cheesy images of them hugging him. Already I wanna give up taking this seriously because it's just plain laughable.\n\nWe get multiple plot twists and betrayals that lead to nothing, a scene in which after Shin meets ghosts in the woods (somehow, as if the only reason is to add to how he values death), he gets fouled on his attempt to kill himself, a scene where Lelouch and Suzaku are in the brig for seemingly no reason (which should mess with his title of Knight of 7 that was both in here and R2), and Leila somehow activating her weird geass (that we don't know the effects of) to not only stop Shin's geass from making her kill herself (because this film confirms that's what it is) but hurts his eye temporarily. There are some rather generic greeting and emotion scenes as well, and all the while, Akito, Ashley, Yukiya, Ayano, and Ryou, are trapped in a sinking airship that had inexplicably placed bombs on it. Then, they make it out, some bad slapstick between Ashley and Jean (the girl who betrayed him for Shin), and then our heroes prepare for a new battle. Again, it damages the story of the main series, and it still has plenty of issues, but it's not as horribly written as the last two films, albeit that doesn't say much, given how trite this is.\n\nI know development doesn't necessarily matter, but that being said, we should know more about these one-note cardboard cut-outs than we do by this point. We are four movies in and at best, we got backstories and one-note traits that get contradicted or abandoned. Shin isn't fleshed out that well either, and ultimately remains a horribly generic character with the only interesting quality being how he seems to value death. As for Ashley, I already addressed why his character falls apart here (wanting revenge for someone you didn't previously care about sacrificing himself in a battle to save you while the one who killed him fights someone else), and he later goes to being a hyperactive character when rescued but that doesn't really affect anything. The two traitors, Warrick (whose attempts literally amount to nothing) and Smilas aren't good either and their betrayals are not foreshadowed whatsoever. Honestly, I really don't have much to say here about them as I've already spelled it their personalities and they haven't really grown, so I'll leave it here and move on.\n\nRemember the improved CGI from the Suzaku fight in the end of movie 3? Well, it's here to stay and thank the maker for that. The fight directing is still borderline incomprehensible but at least the mechs look better, especially the modified version of Ashley's knightmare, with the amazing level of shading put into it. There isn't as much movement with the characters this time around but it's not as static as the first two films at least. Also, there's this one great-looking scene with Shin in the forest where it all changes to some interesting colors and angles to show this ghastly setting, the ghosts that haunt Shin and the universe's logic, and how warped his psyche is. Again, moments like that look awesome and are signs of good direction On top of that, despite my gripes with it, the combat is at least better than the other films, even if it doesn't beat the main series. It's a shame since the rest of the visuals would at least be on par, if not superior in terms of model quality. I just wish the action direction would improve so that the fights are more comprehensible and that there weren't moments of bad airship CGI.\n\nWhile the OST still isn't memorable, I'm at least glad that we got some new tracks as well as a brand new and superior ED theme, even if some of the tracks get replayed here more than ever (namely the one with the flaring trumpets which is still not fitting with the scenarios they put it in). I'm still glad that it's hanging on less and to the shadow of the Kotaro Nakagawa OSTs of the main series, even if it still only barely works.\n\nAt this rate, this sub-series has done a bit too much harm to Code Geass and some of its concepts to really warrant being considered tactful at handling the continuity of the main series. It's also too deeply flawed to be considered a narratively sound series if you haven't figured both of these things out by movie 3. At this point, you're probably continuing on \"because Code Geass\" like I am, and already know that this is a bad set of movies, even if these last two have been enjoyable, both ironically and unironically. Either way, can't wait to see how the last film screws things up since people keep saying that's the worst one of them all.

Really. What did I expect would happen. This entire series has been an absolute joke, unworthy of bearing the name \"Code Geass\", and people have been saying that this film was the worst of them all, so what was I to expect? Well, the last two films were enjoyable in comparison to the first two despite people calling them terrible in comparison to the first two, so maybe I could've been able to see this as somewhat misunderstood. Then again, this is Akito the Exiled, I think the concept of redemption and good writing is impossible for it to grasp. Now, I'm not gonna pretend the main series was perfect, far from it, but even R2, which already had it's fair share of bafflingly stupid and convoluted moments, looks like a masterpiece compared to this atrocity, and it's predecessors. Even then, I thought film 2 was bad. No...film 2 is actually passable compared to this pigshit of an installment. Now, what went so wrong here as to make me want to surgically remove this, and by extension, the entire Akito series from the body of the Code Geass franchise? Well, let's find out, shall we?\n\nPicking up right where we left off, except we jump a week because apparently no one took action in a week. After Ashley fails to convince Jean to join him, she suddenly has doubts about her goal of helping Shin. Then, we launch into a full-blown siege. It's after the Euro-Britannians make it in that we get an infinite amount of problems. The directing is so bad that we usually don't even get to see where those grappling cable latches hang on to. Also, when Ayane corners Jean and has a laughable scene of trying to convince and then hug her, Jean suddenly thinks she's the one with power in the situation. Then we begin the final battle between Akito and Shin after Shin has knocked back Ashley and Ryou. Where was Yukiya? In recovery before going to his new unit and taking down a big cannon on that explodes and land on him before doing so, yet he still survives, but we'll get back to that.\n\nThe second half is where things turn from bad to utter bullshit. During the battle of brothers, we see them teleport but still be there (probably thanks to Leila's bullshit geass), and it's at this point where we get a LITERAL DEUS EX MACHINA! Right after the entire command center sans Leila is riddled with bullet holes, we see this geass-related collective entity again in her beautiful glory, as she basically doesn't explain jack to Leila that is relevant aside from the fact that she still has a \"fragment of geass\" since I guess children can't be able to have full geasses (not unless you're Mao from Code Geass R1 but this series has done enough damage to the main one) but somehow reverses time long enough for Leila to completely rethink the situation to avoid her crew dying (despite the fact that it's the same amount of time she has earlier and she never thought of anything at the moment). I guess Leila's geass allows her to see a vision of her parents conversing with her without knowing it's her, and I guess she can see and project other people's memories, but none of this is explained well at all and we never get a definitive effect if the geass she has (albeit it seemingly does multiple things despite a geass being able to have only ONE POWER, like controlling, forcing one to kill, etc.), and somehow this allowed everyone in the main group to make cheesy speeches about helping Akito and telling Shin not to kill him, no matter how far away they are. Time for the final act, and the final nail in the coffin.\n\nWe see Shin's and Akito's sorry excuses for backstory. Apparently, Akito was born from a different father, and when Shin walked in, he not only deduced who the real father is in an instant (despite the father looking nothing like the son whatsoever (not even hair color)) but also became nihilistic due to that, to the point of feeling betrayed by his mother and receiving a Geass that makes people kill themselves (except Akito because fuck logic, right?). About that being, who is what is it? It's fully established that you need a living being that has code in order for him/her to be able to give a geass to someone, not this abstract skull thing that just appeared into this works because whatever. Then, he kills his whole family because Jennie values death (but never takes his own life for some reason) and \"wants to set them free from this awful world\". As you can see, his backstory is edge-filled and stupid as hell. Also, he devolves into a madman and now both of them can see ghosts and visions of living veins shouting for Akito not to die (none of this makes any sense and none of this is explained), and then Jean appears right outta nowhere to kill Shin and take the fatal sword blow for Akito (because she had minor conflict and was convinced with just a simple hug). Also, yeah, every good guy is alive, even when they shouldn't be, like Yukiya. Also, remember the plot point about Smilas trying to become a dictator? Well, this movie forgot about it until the end credits where he and everyone are quickly killed by Ashley because tying up plot points in a pathetic and clumsy way since we forgot to address this big plot point during the edit the film, is what Akito is best at. Speaking of, Lelouch and Suzaku are told by Rolo (in a post-credits scene mind you) that daddy Charles wants to see them. This doesn't even resolve this dangling thread that jeopardizes R2's existence. It's all just left to dry in the hot sunny day!\n\nDevelopment doesn't even matter anymore; nothing can save these characters from being dogshit. Let's start with Leila. Her geass is horribly defined and nothing but contrivances and deus ex machinas for the sake of the abomination called a plot, and it's thanks to this supervisor whose appearance and existence makes no sense in the context of the franchise. Plus, she's a lot happier this time around for some reason. Ayano, Ryou, and Yukiya also remain the same, and so does Ashley. The biggest problem lies with Shin. I already mentioned how retarded his backstory is, but there's the rest of how he's written, which still made him a generic \"not valuing life\" antagonist. There's really nothing to him but wasted potential for an interesting villain. Jean has a pathetically realized excuse for conflict and resolution, Suzaku goes out of character to choke Lelouch for no reason, and we're left with a pathetic cast of underutilized and underdeveloped twits that could've been actually interesting and properly written. Oh yeah, and General Smilas is here too. Say hi before he dies because you only see him and his goons for all of 10 seconds in the end credits before they get destroyed. Not gonna mention anyone else either, they're not memorable and suffer from the same problems as Leila: no one was fleshed out or ever written to be compelling beforehand, so they're left to rot here.\n\nSomehow the CGI is more poorly integrated than before, and there are moments where the CGI blatantly dips in quality and integration, like when Ashley disposes of Smilas. The directing here is at its worst, with awful and unnecessary shaky cam and some awful shot composition here and there. The character art and animation are both as good as the previous two films though, so that's a plus (there, I gave this shitty movie a compliment; happy now?). We also get a sort-of sword fight between Shin and Akito (sort-of since it's one-sided and Akito doesn't even do much fighting after the first 30 seconds of swordplay), and some decently done death scenes of Jean and Shin (in terms of look and direction, not content), but overall, the last two looked better than this film.\n\nThe only new addition to the mediocre Akito music library this time is the mediocre ED, and it's as boring as the other ones. Remember that I'll-fitting blaring trumpet piece? Well, here they play it in the most ill-fitting battle of the bunch. That piece is for chaotic moments, which doesn't really occur here. I really have nothing left to say. This movie doesn't even add new background OSTs to the mix like the previous two did, which also emphasizes how much worse the production of this one was in comparison to the last one, and this is supposed to be the final hurrah of the sub-series! Bah!\n\nI genuinely wish this sub-series didn't exist, or at least, that is was written to actually respect the logic of the franchise and not ruin itself or fail its characters. This final film really makes the other Akito movies look decent by comparison. I'm done with Akito the Exiled, and I'll probably never see this sub-series again. In fact, why am I even raging? This thing doesn't even exist. None of these films exist, and if they did, they wouldn't have a right to bear the name of the franchise.

It's 14 episodes of (mostly) pure, bona-fide filler. This show is a midquel that answers next to nothing about Season 1, particularly because Season 1 left little to be explained. This season takes place before the last 4 episodes of season 1. The 2nd season starts off well. It's a small adventure that only really becomes relevant in the Haruhi Movie. Then, the Endless 8 begins. Episode 2, is also good. Then, episode 3 redoes a lot of the previous episode with a twist! Everyone is in an absurdly high time loop spanning over 15,000 repeats. First off, since all of the following episodes of the arc literally go one repeat after another, why not start this off with say 50 loops, and then continually increase the number dramatically? It would be more like the show to do that. Then, episodes 4-8 repeat the exact same episode (episode 3) with minute changes. Finally, episode 9 breaks the loop in hilariously stupid fashion after terrible buildup with 7 episodes that show no progression towards the arc. This whole thing literally could`ve been resolved in three episodes. One for introduction, one for setup, and one for resolution. \n\nAs for the final arc, I've actually seen people DEFEND this arc, which really boggles my mind as to something just as mind-numbingly stupid as the Endless 8. Honestly, we'll save this one's biggest problem for later as this arc`s biggest sin is how badly it botched up the characters. Let's put it this way. Season 1 established that when Haruhi is visibly upset, a different field of the world begins to suffer the wrath of giant monsters, and that could prove dangerous to the real world. At one point, Haruhi is the most unhappy she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ever been via confrontation that she effectively deserved, and NOTHING HAPPENS!!! First off, Haruhi brought this on herself, and Kyon was scolding her for being basically tyrannical to her friends, and he's forced to APOLOGIZE?! WHY?! Haruhi also gets off scot-free for being so horrible. also, for how \"smart\" she is, she should've put two and two together during the final scene of Season 2. I get that maybe trying to hit her was a bit out of hand, but still, she needed some repercussion for being so damn awful! This season was pretty awful by this point by this moment killed any chance of it recovering. The ending sucked too, just to let you know.                                                       \n\nIf you know Haruhi Suzumiya, you know that she's kind of a spoiled brat with an (understandable) god complex. She's a bit of an ass, a tyrannical one, but you understand why she's that way, and see her developed into a slightly more polite and caring person. Despite the fact that this season takes place after the events containing most of her development, this final arc, in particular, decided to DECIMATE all decency from her, and flanderize her obnoxiousness and bratty-ness to new levels. She actively treats Mikuru like a sexy slave, even more so than in season 1. She becomes a bigger dick than ever and ignores all sense of likability and development. Mikuru is reduced to a whiny moe slave for the series who only accomplishes following Haruhi`s demands, and only to varying effect. Itsuki is the same, only spouting off his stuff under unreasonable circumstances that only serve to make Haruhi a Karma Houdini, which sort of waters him down a bit.  Kyon, is the same, only less entertaining, less intelligent, and less snarky, meaning that like almost everyone else, he is at least somewhat watered down here too. Yuuki Nagato is the only character with any improvement, as we see a more urgent and ambiguously caring side of her, as she does some risky things this time around. Unfortunately, the side characters are less present, and less likable, albeit, when Haruhi makes you drug your friend with alcohol, and you accept in a heartbeat, that's bound to happen.\n\nKnowing KyoAni, brilliant animation to them is as simple as doing a worksheet of simple math problems. Takes a bit, but it's easy and leads to damn good scores. Not much was stepped up, other than slight changes to character models, though I kinda like the change. While this season didn't get to show off its creative muscles like Season 1 did, the animation was still really good, and if it got to show off some of the amazing stuff Season 1 did, it would've gotten a 10, for even the minute changes in the Endless 8 are appreciated, as they change the clothing, and give new angles for repeated scenes. This is always a highlight of the franchise, and even though this season sucks, at least it lived up to KyoAni's expectations in the animation department. Too bad it was wasted in this garbage-tier anime.                                                                     \n\nUnfortunately, the music isn't as good as in season 1. Luckily, it's still overall decent. The OP and ED themes are once again, great, really capturing the tone of the series, and are just as good, if not better than those of season 1, even if they'll never become as ubiquitous as \"Hare Hare Yukai\", season 1's ED. This season, otherwise, added nothing to the soundtrack, and the recurring themes aren't memorable, minus a few jingles in some of the themes. Also, while the dub has the same voice actors and talents, the repetitive dialogue for the Endless 8, along with Mikuru's aggravating squealing, bog it down a bit. Heck, Kyon doesn't even get any deliciously scathing monologues here.                            \n\nThis series had no right to be as long and annoying as it was, and the botched characters, nigh-useless story, and painful moments make me hate this show, no matter how pretty it is, or how good it sounds. Honestly, this is an allegory for how this season made me feel about Haruhi herself, attractive and with a nice voice, but a total bitch. Yes, the first two episodes are good, and yes, the Endless 8 had the potential to be pretty good if they cut large portions out and made the set-up more in line with the spirit of the show, but overall, this series can't stack up to its predecessor in any way other than production. Lastly, thank God for the movie since if not for that, this would've actually killed the anime franchise as a whole with it being such a gigantic pain. With that, I bid you adieu."}, {"id": 3499, "score": 20, "body": "\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing to my brain?!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my line, fucker!\n\nWelcome to Brain Damagd: Yoshiyuki Tomino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mentally handicapped potential answer to Evangelion. Comparing the latter to the former is comparing Hyperion to a satyr. Perhaps that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t strong enough to indicate the sheer gap between the two, or what an utter waste of time this dreck is for those not seeking to witness every single Tomino, mecha, and post-Eva anime out there.\n\nThe writing is more detrimental than a lobotomy, and more nonsensical than lobotomizing an infant. Their horrendous Eva-inspired attempts at biomechanical pseudoscience and Gundam-inspired attempts at terminology, are as convoluted as they are nonsensical and inconsistent. The show is also spectacularly blunt to the point of telling you exactly what a character is like constantly despite how obvious it is just from the interactions, yet next to none of these characters have any real consistency. Half of what \u00e2\u0080\u009ccharacters\u00e2\u0080\u009d say and do, particularly early on, directly contradict what was told and shown to us prior, as early as the end of episode 1. Hell, the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccharacters\u00e2\u0080\u009d can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even be called caricatures, let alone what I put in quotation marks, with the exception of a fucking scientist side-character and a boring yet remotely competently-written purple-haired girl. None of the rest have concrete personalities and all of them dramatically at the drop of a hat, often within the same scene. This is especially problematic at the beginning, not only because this is where it is most prevalent, but because this is supposed to be the first impression, where we get to know these \u00e2\u0080\u009ccharacters\u00e2\u0080\u009d. \n\nWhenever they even try to give these characters backstories and conflicts, they come from the most hackneyed and unforeshadowed of places, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s excluding things done offscreen. Then again, this series has a real penchant for introducing things right out of thin air. Not only do the aforementioned characters engage in excessive last-minute flashbacks as a result, but they also reveal themselves to humongous hypocrites...and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supposed to root for the protagonists when they suffer from this almost exclusively. The main protagonist (and yes, none of these cunts deserve to be named) is the worst offender of this, going from kissing to harassing the female deuteragonist -whom he barely even knows let alone seems to like- in a split second, constantly, and goes from acting like an insufferable jackass to an idealistic kid who can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even get his reasoning straight for why he defected from an organization he previously white-knighted like it was his girlfriend -not like he had one to begin with but damn if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re gonna try to make him seem like an actual human being worth keeping alive-. Then again, this is partially because they constantly try to play coy with why he left and make it such a mystery, much to the obvious detriment of absolutely everything. He is honestly one of the worst protagonists in anime, and out of all the nothing characters who leave next to no impression in your mind, he stands out simply by virtue of being toxically broken and hateful. \n\nMaybe Tomino should have thought twice before trying to do Eva backwards.\n\nThe visual presentation is unfortunate as well. The mech designs are bland and generic, without any thought into making them look like anything other than unmarketable drones. The character designs are, if nothing else, pleasant for most part, and they are generally on-model, even if actual animation for both the characters and mechs is somewhat limited, if not incredibly awkward in some cases. Fight scenes are downright horrendous, especially since in these particular sequences, shots almost never flow into each other, and they either have very stilted and limited animation, or try the kind of shorthand that could only ever work in DBZ. Even outside of fight sequences, the editing is generally horrible and nonsensical. Whatever CGI techniques they used such as trying to make ocean water CGI, is almost embarrassingly done as well, but that is the least of the visuals\u00e2\u0080\u0099 problems when the show can rarely do rain in a way that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mortifyingly obvious that they drew lines and moved them back and forth for ten seconds. When your opening sequence begins with a borderline laughable static moving background effect, you know you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in for a production misfire.\n\nThe music is honestly the least atrocious aspect of it, not that it says much, as even Yoko Kanno couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t operate at full capacity. The music is largely, and said music often doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fit when it tries to be more than just stand-in fluff, particularly in the first half. The OP theme is barely any better, and while the ED theme is probably the best piece of music here, it is hardly memorable past the first 10 seconds. The voice acting is also subpar at best, with line delivery that ranges from mediocre to terrible for a majority of the characters. Then again, the script they have to work with is honestly abysmal, so much so that some things just could not work, regardless of acting quality.\n\nBrain Damagd is honestly a bothersome experience that stops being bizarrely horrible and just becomes a slog filled with a detestable and borderline nothing cast, and a narrative that works on absolutely no level. Even the audiovisuals are not worthwhile. I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even recommend screenwriting enthusiasts to go in for a full autopsy of this disaster, or recommend it to anyone who desperately needs to suffer through every post-eva show out there. I'm not even sure why I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m talking about it or why I watched it; this braindead travesty is an absolute waste of time that should have never been made, barring its ridiculous concepts and some laughable moments. To be perfectly fair, there were moments when the show clearly tried to be meaningful and even human, but they are mere blips in a sea of embarrassment. Unless you plan to watch every Tomino, Post-Eva, or mech anime out there, or watch this with friends, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re probably better off not acknowledging this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existence, unless you want a cheap laugh here and there. Perhaps someone can make a best hits of this show's schlockiest moments; that would be the definitive Brain Damagd experience.\n\n\n\n\nWait...the fuck do you mean it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not called Brain Damagd?!"}, {"id": 3506, "score": 30, "body": "A naked guy on a beach with amnesia wakes up with a girl laying face down on his dick. This is the first scene of Island, a show airing this summer anime 2018 season. Labeled as a drama sci fi show, Island takes place on an island that is isolated by the rest of the world. Bound by its old traditions, the island has its own social structure, which consists of their three families basically acting as major political figures on the island. Recently, the island has been under some distress and the families are under suspicion. These odd circumstances can only be solved by the daughters of the three families, named Rinne Karen, and Sara, and by a mysterious man that washes up on the beach devoid of all memories. Except the fact that he is named Setsuna.\n\nThis show is quite obviously a visual novel. It has three girls, and a protagonist that looks generic as have the watcher imprint themselves on them, and a story that clearly shows all of the girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story options. Now me myself haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t played or seen any gameplay of the game, but with basic visual novel tropes I can guess some things about the anime based on that. So the anime tried to adapt all of the endings and make it flow into a cohesive story. I feel as though this backfired though, because it feels suddenly split from one girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s storyline to the next one, which made things more confusing for me. And it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help either that Sara and Karen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story ended before the 6 or 7 episode mark. I guess in this visual novel there is a very specific girl you were meant to follow, and they tried to make the majority of the show about that. That in and of itself isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bad, but it feels like the other two stories were rushed. Especially with Sara\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story, where the revelation and the twist happened literally in the span of 10 minutes. It was resolved as soon as they knew what the problem was. And after both their stories were finished, they were forced to the sidelines almost immediately, now acting as side or even filler characters to react to what they protagonist and Rinne does.\n\nIts mentioned in the synopsis that the island is cut off from the rest of the world, which suggests a more tropical, deserted island feeling. But, this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the case at all, and is pretty industrialized for what it claims to be. It seems to be receiving manufactured goods, so the only way its cut off is that the families won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let anybody enter or leave. Another issue is with the genre tags used for this show. The first half of the show doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have anything to do with sci fi at all. Even some of the middle episode after that only hint at some ancient technology before we get hit all at once during the last 4 or so episodes. Before that its a slice of life drama with a piece of mystery through and through. \n\nThe characters in this show represent your basic girl tropes in anime. Karen is the blond hair tsundere who is the daughter of the family that currently runs things. Sara is a shrine girl loli that works really hard to compensate for her family that has gone off the map in terms of politics. And Rinne is the main girl which has the most backstory and development behind her. The protagonist I already touched on as being your typical anime protagonist. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say the any of them are good characters. There are always leaps in logic and stuff that should have been obvious, but wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go far beyond in accordance to their personalities. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re mostly carried by their stories.\n\nIsland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story is confusing, rushed, and boring. The first 6 episodes were very very slow, almost completely ignoring the sci fi tag. And even when they did go into the mystery more, I just ended up not caring for anything they were showing me. Or in this case, telling me. Maybe if this show was more then one cour or season, they would have had the time to flesh out the stories of each character more. I feel like they stories they presented were genuinely interesting, but it was just presented in such a way to the point where it became a snooze fest full of characters I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care about.\n\nThe art in this show is below average. In terms of both character art as well as background art. On a tropical island, you were expect to get long shots of beautiful beaches or some pretty pictures of some of the scenery you would see. Island has that, but they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look good in the slightest. If the show takes place in a setting where it's supposed to be bright sunny and beautiful, I would assume you would spend more of the budget on its art. This show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s animation is also sub par. Its very stiff and it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do much extra when it comes to its \u00e2\u0080\u009caction\u00e2\u0080\u009d scenes. It's not on the lowest tier of animation I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen, but it's enough to notice that something is wrong here.\n\nIsland, for me, felt like it had more to say. But its short run time made it feel like they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get enough stuff into it as they would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve liked. Anyway, the end result is a bad show all around. I recommend this to someone who wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind waiting for a while to watch a only decent sci fi mystery. Maybe someone else can appreciate Island more than I could. I give this show a 3 out of 10. This has been PixEFit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spoiler free, but not really anime review on Island.\n"}, {"id": 3518, "score": 22, "body": "The Master of Ragnarok and Blesser of Einherjar is a truly humiliating work. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so comically inept and earnest in the name of its intended ambitions and atrocities that it becomes endearingly pathetic for a while. I was wholly prepared to come write about how this show was the ultimate waste of time in terms of creating it, watching it, and especially reviewing it. It still is in many ways, especially when it becomes downright insufferable later on, but this deformed gem belongs in the same realm as classics such as Big Order and The Room. I mean, just look at this thing, this clueless, fugly piece of shit!\n\nThis show is the penultimate production shitshow! To begin with the easiest of targets, the CGI is as prevalent as it is laughable. The stills are more frequent than bits of animation, resulting in some garbage action and hentai-like sequences. The animated fight sequences aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much better, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nigh impossible to appreciate the \u00e2\u0080\u009caction\u00e2\u0080\u009d on any level.. As if all that wasn't enough, the people at studio EMT\u00c2\u00b2 created this terrible Ufotable-esque art-style similar to the infamous Chaos Dragon, and they struggled heavily to keep their character models consistently drawn. Shame cuz some of the women are so hot that they deserve much better, at least until you realize what utter objects they all are. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when that becomes debatable.\n\nThe female characters in this show are borderline humiliating, especially the twin additions to the harem. While they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at the very least varied in terms of what kind of objects they are and even much of an object they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re characterized as -unlike in Smartphone- they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still barely effective at best and downright worthless at worst. The best things I can say about them is that they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t blatantly fall into any archetype, and that some of their designs, namely Siegrune\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, are cool and have fun clothing. The later ones are so disastrously infuriating and  worthless that after the pink-haired girl showed up, they should have stopped this process altogether and spent more time fleshing out we had. Their leader, Yuuto, is downright hysterical; he is a total piece of shit. Outside of the bitches he collects, patronizes, and still refuses to bone, and this one girlfriend he has at home (along with the few generals and whatnot who are useful), he treats everyone under his ranks with as much contempt as the most reprehensible regime leader villains in anime history. This man will force you to become his slave child or his barely any less subservient little sister, and threaten to massacre your clan if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t comply. His mistresses are all either his children or little sisters, which is obviously for the most unashamedly fetishistic sexual gratitude for both him and the intended audience. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supposed to treat him like a normal harem protagonist cuz he still has most of their hallmarks, or a decent human being just because he regrets having been worse? Fuck outta here! That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like saying we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supposed to pretend any of the remaining side-characters aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the most onenote and worthless things ever. Even he knows how awful he is, and some of it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even his fault.\n\nThe fact that with all this, they still try to set up moments and entire plot-lines with intrigue, attempt to have character arcs with peak \u00e2\u0080\u009cemotional moments\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and take this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story seriously with emotional music and close-ups of women crying in joy or despair to boot, is as rich as it is tragic. It attempts all of that in the name of selling this kind of disastrously nonsensical, badly paced, convoluted, excess, and ill-defined material as something worth getting invested in. They even have several decent fantasy music for the title cards and scenes related to the ongoing war that are often only heard once. When Overlord is just sitting there, cackling in the corner with its superior OP/ED music in the same season this bullfuckery airs, things need to start being re-evaluated. In spite of all this, this show actually tries to indirectly explain the origins of this main character becoming an Isekai protagonist with a single moment of visual storytelling in the opening before eventually elaborating on it. Mad props for the idea, even if the end result was convoluted. For that alone, this thing ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as bad as Smartphone, let alone worthy of being called the worst Isekai ever made. \n\nObviously, the quest of enduring this embarrassment is not for everyone. Most of its problems are so self evident that not only are several of them displayed by the title and cover art, but people not keen on wasting their time would be doing exactly that by watching this thing. This blend of ambition, degeneracy, laziness, and ineptitude is a beast meant for only the most skilled hate-watchers to slay. Even I barely survived half of what happened past the fifth episode, and I was having a blast early on and towards the end. For the brave few who choose to embark, and the animation buffs willing to give this a shot, grab a party. and/or alter your state of consciousness first. If you genuinely enjoy something like this, let nothing stop you other than some mind-shatteringly awful filler episodes.

Angels of death! *Menacing* Angels of Death is about a 13 year old quiet blond girl named Rachel, who wakes up without any memories in some basement of an abandoned building. She wakes up and walks around for a bit and runs into this one interesting character. Some guy wrapped in bandages wielding a scythe named Zack. He tries to kill her, but after a series of spoilerly events they reconcile and decide to work together to escape the building they are trapped in. They are held together by 2 promises. The promise that Zack will do everything he can to help get them out of there, and that when they finally get out, Zach will kill Rachel.\n\nThis is sort of confusing, because this is Rachel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wish. Yes, she wants to die. We can check that motive off the list of edgy anime. But no, wait a minute, she only wants to die by Zack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands though. This is because Zack made a mindless comment on how he \u00e2\u0080\u009cswears to god\u00e2\u0080\u009d that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll kill her, and due to her devout belief, she takes that as a promise that she must help him keep. She's the smart one. The brains.\n\nAs most of these pairs go, Zack is the muscle of the duo. But not so much muscle as a violent, unstoppable, borderline supernatural force. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty stupid and relies on Rachel to give him orders a lot of the time. Well, it's not as much as relies on her, its just that he takes what she tells him to do, and takes it as a suggestion instead of something that will get them out of there faster, easier, and without harm. From what I can see, his only motivation is killing. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only helping Rachel because 1. He wants to kill her, and 2. He wants to get out to kill some more. All of this is in a character design which looks like a 12 year old child of divorce would create. Bandages covering his body entire, black hoodie, bloodstains all over his body, and one of his most prominent features, his huge fucking scythe he just carries around with him for the entire show. I called him a supernatural force earlier because this fucker just won't die. Over the course of the show, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been stabbed, blogdended, ripped open, poisoned, fucking took the electric chair multiple times, and walked away with minimal injuries. To end it off, Zack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice is awful and makes ME want to take the electric chair when he laughs.\n\nEnough about him, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s get into the wondrous story they give us in Angels of Death. As stated earlier, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trapped in a mysterious building, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working to get out of there. They work together to solve puzzles, defeat villains, and get to higher and higher floors. On every floor there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a villain trying to kill them and who they have to defeat to get to the next floor. These are the characters you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see in the poster art. These characters aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really notable and are just as edgy as the main characters. Mainly in the sense where they just want to kill without little motivation to do so except they like to. The protagonist also find clues to learn more about themselves and their pasts in the process.\n\nYou may have read back in the previous paragraph and squinted your eyes just a little bit when I said that they solve puzzles to get out. Maybe you thought it was just some bad wording on my part, but, in fact, they are puzzles. Now you see, Angels of Death was originally a game. Not only a game, an rpg maker game. You can find and play it on steam right now. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how accurately the anime follows the game, but the fact that there are scenes in the anime that directly reference to what I assume were real puzzles in the game. At one point, with no sense or irony at all, they find a switch to open a door hidden underneath a pot. If that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t scream game adaptation, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what is. The anime also has a fuck ton of these long corridors for these characters slowly walk down, which is very game like. With these unnecessarily perfect adaptations of the game, you gotta wonder what creative liberties they took with the anime in the first place. If I would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve watched a lets play on the game, would I have the same experience as I had while watching the anime? I mean, as a game, it has a pretty interesting concept. The protagonist teams up with the first floor boss and goes through the game and watches the 2 bosses duke it out. But it just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t transfer to anime I feel.\n\nThe thing about the animation, is that it sucks most of the time. But, for some reason, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what, the blood splatters that come out of the body looks really good. I the art makes an impression I guess. I mean, its not pretty at all. But it mainly having to do with lots of fun and unique character designs, despite everything being edgy, they look good I must admit. They really represent their character.\n\nOne more thing about this show which, in my eyes, is despicable. At the end of the anime, it's a cliffhanger, you know? Pretty shitty, but the thing is that all the rest will be revealed in the specials revealed in the blu ray release. This is incredibly scummy to me. Having the rest of the story in the specials, means that nobody will be able to finish the story without buying the actual blu ray disk. Legally at least. I guess you could buy the game, but anime onlies are going to be very angry.\n\nI give Angels of Death, a 2 out of 10. I recommend to whoever just wants to watch an terrible edgy show for the lolz. Or just likes edgy stuff."}, {"id": 3535, "score": 35, "body": "\"Anime was a mistake\" - me after watching this\n\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using that meme right at the door and keeping it there, because this is some serious shit. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMotto To Love-Ru\u00e2\u0080\u009d (or To Love-Ru Season 2, which is what it actually is) is an abysmal excuse for an ecchi romantic comedy and it fails on almost every level. Basically every episode devolves into senseless 13-year old puberty wish fulfillment and all the jokes are so obnoxiously juvenile or poorly timed that they fall flat. Character development doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen often, and when it does, it never sticks, because every single named character is a simple caricature of an already-established shonen/ecchi trope, and they will never deviate from that.\n\nEvery character is also incredibly annoying, detrimental to the plot, and unclear in motivation. Lala is an alien princess who likes Rito (the main character) and tinkers with machinery that always has a fatal flaw. 99 times out of 100 this flaw is used to exploit To Love-Ru\u00e2\u0080\u0099s extensive female cast, be it to put Rito into some lewd situation, or to put any of the girls into some insane situation where they lose their clothes or get groped. Even then, the plot never consistently relies on this mechanic- only in the first season is it an incredibly reliable pattern. Instead, each episode of \u00e2\u0080\u009cMotto\u00e2\u0080\u009d has 3 different stories that usually focus on different girls in the harem. I would describe the flaws with each girl, but that would take far too long. Instead, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s look at the things that they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get wrong, because those are much rarer.\n\nOP/ED are serviceable and I have no problems with them. The main character actually is written as a decent person and not a deplorable human like Heaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Lost Property or, more recently, Hajimete no Gal. Rito is a likeable young guy with a crush on a girl from school and a tendency to get into situations rife with misunderstandings, but overall, he does the right thing. The only problem is that everyone fails to learn that, or understand that, so he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basically the opposite of Keiichi from Oh My Goddess.\n\nIn OMG, Keiichi Morisato gets involved with plenty of misunderstandings between himself and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cgoddesses.\u00e2\u0080\u009d However, most of the characters learn and understand that Keiichi has no ill or lewd intent and would not act on any such urges, so most of the misunderstandings are concluded before any conflict can arise. This is satisfying on multiple levels- first, any contrived conflict coming from something out of the character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s control is mitigated, and mostly resolved quickly. Second, even if the conflict still arises, the characters are able to react to it in a new or sensible way, instead of screaming or violence EVERY SINGLE TIME.\n\nIn contrast, Yuuki Rito is the single most misunderstood and abused harem lead ever. Every single skirt flip, wardrobe malfunction, accidental teleportation, body-switching, accidental drugging, rape attempt (yes, really!), is HIS FAULT. WITHOUT ANY DOUBTS. He is consistently on the receiving end of slapstick violence and high school girl screaming for all of the things he never does, or in some instances, is literally incapable of doing. If he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t such a great guy, this would be FINE. But he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clearly pure-hearted and shy! Well, as pure-hearted as a teenager can get. \n\nPeople do not fully enjoy seeing good people get punished, without retribution or reason behind it. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use an example to explain how this cycle works. \n\n In a similar vein to To Love-Ru, Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou is a harem focused around one guy and all the strange girls who fall in love with him, and their daily life. In one chapter/episode, one of the girls (Miia) is accosted and manipulated by a (presumably male) creeper into almost-rape on a canoe, but the main guy (Kurusu) arrives just in time to stop it in a both comedic and important manner. This actually involves some character development- Kurusu has never gone to such extreme lengths for any of the girls like that before, and it is even revealed later that he was trying to find Miia to give her a gift. Also notable is his treatment of the creeper, offering to undress \u00e2\u0080\u009chim\u00e2\u0080\u009d so that they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get sick from being wet. \u00e2\u0080\u009cConflict -> Tension -> Fear -> Comedic Action -> Catharsis -> Development.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Not only does it help the viewer further understand the established characters involved, but it provides a proper resolution to the conflict, attempts a light comedic moment, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very well-paced and introduced. \n\nTo Love-Ru does none of this. At the start of each segment, a girl is \u00e2\u0080\u009cchosen\u00e2\u0080\u009d to star, and she gets in some mess, and Rito is involved/blamed. The situations are lined with depravity and perverted wish fulfillment, from anything to an incestous relationship with a little sister, having a girl almost coerce you into rape after you do a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgentlemanly\u00e2\u0080\u009d act for her, licking a girl erotically while morphed into a dog, accidental sexting with an uptight student body member, and excessive amounts of unnecessary softcore tentacle hentai. A large majority of these events are treated as if the viewer should just sit back and enjoy the boobs (which are pretty much always either HUGE or nonexistent) while nothing substantial happens. And you know what, that would be perfectly fine, if\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\nThis show didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pretend to have a plot. Consistently it is referenced that some of the girls actually seriously view Rito as a romantic interest, most notably Haruna (Rito\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crush) and Lala. This is brought up as if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a problem? Though Rito, at the beginning of To Love-Ru, was very clearly only interested in Haruna, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only randomly brought up in \u00e2\u0080\u009cMotto\u00e2\u0080\u009d (and parts of the first season) that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interested in Lala, though it feels pointless and out of left field, especially considering how Rito\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life became pure hell after he met her. But that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why this show makes me so angry. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not advertised as pure softcore porn/ecchi. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advertised to have story, progression, character development. And it has NONE OF THAT. It is as structurally sound as Kiss x Sis, as substantial as a sheet of cardboard with fake boobs drawn on it. The plot is only occasionally used to bring DRAMA and TENSION that feels, somehow, even MORE contrived than the rest of the plot. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s painful to see such a decent base for a story be so wasted.\n\nInstead, go watch/read Oh My Goddess or MonMusu. Maybe even Shuffle or Oshiete! Galko-chan, if you really need the high school setting. They have actual character development, well-timed humor, and substantial plots. And hell, you can even get some enjoyment out of the first season of To Love-Ru. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not an 8/10 but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so much better than \u00e2\u0080\u009cMotto\u00e2\u0080\u009d that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s insane.\n"}, {"id": 3542, "score": 40, "body": "(Discussed further in Episode 5 of the podcast I am in, Digitized Desperadoes. Here's a link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWmf9zO83y8 )\n\nWhat we have here is an unfortunate casualty of moe culture. It tries to (ab)use moe culture archetypes and typical story structure, but its attempt at distancing itself from more typical entries that tend towards slice-of-life is adding the feature of a unique world that has no place in our reality, and thus tries to make itself interesting. The world is that of a strangely pro-military global culture, where all high schools (perhaps only Japan, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to that later) are on giant aircraft carriers and girls are encouraged to take up tactical tank skirmishes to \u00e2\u0080\u009cenhance their feminine charm.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This anime follows the story of Nishizumi, the demure protagonist with a family history of these tank battles (sensha-do in Japanese, Tankery in the Crunchyroll subs, Gun-fu elsewhere) and her schoolmates in their attempt to take the national competition to save their school. This is the most hackneyed concept you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll ever see in what is essentially a sports/underdog story. It features most prominently in its contemporary, the Love Live franchise, and is wholly unoriginal at that.\n\nThe plot is awful. Big deal, right? You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not really watching something like this for a deep narrative, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll fully admit to that. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect anything groundbreaking. What matters are the characters and the tank battles.\n\nThe characters suck and the tank battles are\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 good, but I hesitate to say that. \n\nThe characters are so godforsaken unoriginal that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s painful to watch. They toe the line of what is acceptable in moe culture, with all of them being \u00e2\u0080\u009cfairly normal and cute, but just weird enough that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re somewhat fetishized.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They fit the mold of being just strange and relatable enough to materialize in the fantasies of conformist Japanese youth. One girl has family pressure to be girly, one girl has an unwell grandmother/guardian, one girl is an otaku, one team is obsessed with volleyball, one team is all history nuts\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re as one-note as you get. And the entire thing always follows the trend of \u00e2\u0080\u009coh no, something bad is happening\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but it got solved afterwards, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s OK!\u00e2\u0080\u009d One girl gets disowned by her mom for joining the tankery team. After a victory, the mom is okay with it. The main character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family dislikes that she does things like \u00e2\u0080\u009chas fun\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cthinks creatively.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So she beats them in a tank match and they get all nice. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stupid and stupidly predictable. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never a realistic or compelling arc, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all typical \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe do not support you, but after you try really hard we love you and forget whatever troubles we had.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In real life, sometimes you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make peace or reconcile people, but usually it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot less black and white than anything. I feel like there are too many instances of a family disowning a child for just\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 playing a sport, when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not at all comparable to anything in reality that would get to the level of disowning.\n\nOn that note, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talk about the world-building. High schools have been decreed to be on giant warships/aircraft carriers. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pretty sure it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stated that this is in Japan only, but all of the other teams do seem to come from different countries, like America, Britain, Russia, and Germany, so this makes no sense. Also, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a national competition? Also, you see lots of support and quasi-propaganda for Tankery all around. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a professional sport, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s highly encouraged for girls to join, it has a lot of money pumped into it across the world\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But yet pretty much all of the girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 families are like \u00e2\u0080\u009cuhh why would you do that sport? No one does that/it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unfeminine/you get nothing out of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Even though there are tank cafes and tank specialty stores, just like, in a normal town. A town without a tankery team, also!\n\nThat reminds me, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s absolutely hammered into the viewer that the high school will be shut down. The student council knows about it very early, and other rivals from other schools blatantly admit to that knowledge, yet there are no rumors or leaks of this information. No one knows about it except for\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 rival schools, and the leadership of the school. In Love Live it was announced to the entire world, because you know, these aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t things that happen secretly or under cover. You kind of have to let _students of your school_ know that ___their school might not exist in a year___, especially when they live at their school. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unnecessary melodrama, like all of the non-battle stuff in the narrative. And there are a few episodes that are completely character arcs and slice-of-life rather than battles, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m complaining about subtext or sideplots, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely around half of the anime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focus. Also, even in some of the combat scenes they feel the need to include a line from every single peanut gallery character in order to remind the viewer that \u00e2\u0080\u009coh, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still here! And they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still weird and cute, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry!\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s infuriating. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a particularly bad set of episodes against the Russian team (e8 or 9) where literally every single member of the allied team gets a line of dialogue just to prove that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re confident. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so stupid.\n\nThe battles? Yeah, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re fine. The animation is neat. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like the CG for the motion at the beginning but by the end, it looks great. I have a special fondness for the 3-4 first person combat segments, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really dynamic and adrenaline-pumping. The tactics are mostly interesting and only occasionally (the fights between the first and last) devolve into simple underdog/gimmick combat. They clearly did research on tank battles and the specifications of each model of tank, and how they react in certain environments. It feels like a low-stakes war, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s refreshing to see. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a lot of complaints. If the show was 24/7 low-stakes tank battles (take out the fucking school closing subplot) I would love it. But it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. So I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t love it at all.\n\nThe fanservice is infuriating. The main school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s uniform has this really uncomfortably short skirt that they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wear spats under, so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dumb. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also this gag where they lose a match so they do an embarrassing dance in an embarrassing outfit, which comes back later when they have the whole \u00e2\u0080\u009cgroup sings to improve morale\u00e2\u0080\u009d scene. The orange-haired girl who I hate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s whole gimmick is that she likes guys and dating them but doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually have any experience, but almost all of her dialogue devolves into \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m good at texting!\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis ought to help me get guys!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe historical references with each team are entertaining but useless, and all of the teams are unnecessarily antagonistic before the matches, turning into straight up hatred and derision. None of the teams are sportsmanlike before they lose, but they turn into perfect sweethearts afterwards. The soundtrack works well with the nationalities, because most of it is actual classical music from certain countries. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neat but it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand out.\n\nOverall? I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like it, and I would never recommend this to anyone. If you like tanks, watch it. If you like historical tank battles, watch it. If you like really boring cute girls with vague tragic backstories, go watch it somewhere else I guess. 4/10."}, {"id": 3543, "score": 40, "body": "(Discussed further in Episode 6 of the podcast I am in, Digitized Desperadoes. Here's a link- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TtJpcsp7zY )\n\nBefore I watched A Place Further than the Universe, I assumed it was another wholesome and substanceless slice-of-life CGDCT anime, like Yuru Camp, in the same season. After it aired, it gained massive popularity on online communities like Reddit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s /r/anime and the MyAnimeList ratings/forums. During that time, I endured a barrage of posts of praise of this show. And so, delving into it, what did I think? Did the hype hold up? Was it worth it?\n\nSimply put, no. This show deserved next to none of the hype, and I am completely underwhelmed at every single aspect of it. Nothing stands out, at all. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an incredibly generic tale of people with a dream, attempting to achieve that dream, and succeeding. It takes no risks and it executes every single trope imaginable, all played straight with no subversion. All of the storytelling and concepts are laced with moe archetypes and pathos-filled scraps of narrative.\n\nTo me, I would compare it to a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfeel-good\u00e2\u0080\u009d movie, like those of the American Hallmark Channel. It hits every beat of plot structure, establishes conflicts, resolves them, and, boom- catharsis. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all so formulaic and predictable. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an example- one might say the main character is raven-haired maiden Shirase, the daughter of a woman who explored and penned a novel on the Antarctic, before dying on an expedition. Her entire character is that she wants to go to Antarctica to resolve her lingering grief over her mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it. Her entire arc is based around her mother and, occasionally, one of the other members of the expedition. You learn no more about her life, nothing about her father, nothing about what her mother did beyond write a book and die in Antarctica. Her beginning, middle, and end is defined by her mother and no one else. The viewer does not see her become her own person, she does not make any noticeable growth out of her attachment.\n\nAnd I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the failure of this story for me. The characters are patently uninteresting and filled to the brim with moe cliches. One character is a hyper-intelligent savant who dropped out of high school. Her flaw? She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of clumsy, and oh no, she has issues with people being nice to her! How cute! That\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll sell those blu-rays. One character is a fairly popular idol-type girl who has no friends. Her character is that she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get how friendship works. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all kinds of problematic- they clearly portray her loneliness as something like a disease, that can only be cured by lots of warm hugs and karaoke. They ignore the mental hangups involved with being a loner, they ignore how this could be construed as abuse from her mother who forced her into becoming a young actress. They romanticize her loneliness, turn it into something awkward and adorable rather than potentially crippling. I hesitate to do this, but look at Oregairu or WataMote. Those loners create intricate personal fantasies about why they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a loner or how they do or do not deserve it. That, as someone with few friends growing up, is the realistic aspect. But no, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry, that lonely girl will totally have perfect mental health if you just pat her head and tell her you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re her friend. No trust issues, no depression. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fine.\n\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing wrong with the premise. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely fascinating to watch an actual Antarctic expedition- these kinds of things are fully out of the public eye, deemed uninteresting due to the complicated logistics required. The information provided in the anime seems realistic, for the most part, and I appreciate that some level of research went into it. The execution, however, is where it all fails.\n\nLoneliness and dreaming are both heavily romanticized in this anime. Shirase is problematic for yet another reason. Her dream is seen as strange among her peers, not surprising for the community-over-individual leanings of Asian society. But the story continues to build her up as someone we should all respect, learn from, and emulate, without even thinking. The show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s point of view protagonist is inspired by her, and decides to take a rash trip to Antarctica just because she thought it sounded kind of interesting, and she was bored. This is a harmful way of thinking, and I believe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fantasy to the point of being absurd. Shirase is just as much misguided in her dream as the others are for following her.\n\nThe idea of dreams as something that \u00e2\u0080\u009ccan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wait for you\u00e2\u0080\u009d is just hilarious. Dreams are an aspect that grow and evolve with our own mindsets and society. They are a culmination of our aspirations and our desires, the road to our ideal self, and hopefully, our ideal world. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re abstract and incredibly hard to actually achieve, otherwise, they devolve into a glorified to-do list. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need friends to accomplish your dreams. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need absurd amounts of money. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need a company of like-minded individuals. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to suffer. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to defeat your demons. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your dream. Make it on your own terms, on your own time, even if it takes you 100 years.\n\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say the morals in this show are bad, by any stretch of the imagination. There are a few nice and hopeful quotes from certain emotional moments that I agreed with. Specifically, I like some of the musings on perspective, on how we are all living our lives and no one else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, despite it all running simultaneously. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very mature thing to think of, and it helps to remind oneself that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not the only person. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mentioned once, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all you need. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to hear about grabbing your youth by the balls five hundred times in one anime. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need any more flashbacks to your mom dying or you hesitating. Just keep it simple, and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t relentlessly force your ideals into your viewer. If they get it, cool, if they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just how art works.\n\nOne of my more serious and citable problems with the show is the sheer inconsistency of tone, or rather, that some of the scenes and settings do not work in the defined narrative. The narrative is a coming-of-age, inspirational tale of some high schoolers doing something very difficult in pursuit of joy, accomplishment, and release. So why is half of it dedicated to awful gags and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 \u00e2\u0080\u009ccute girls doing cute things?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sure, I can stand that your mom is very very dead for long enough, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to see you stammer on camera for the millionth time or cry because you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get how human interaction works. Oh, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you want to see some adorable and #relatable anime girls say that durian is gross but eat it anyway? It reeks of moe culture and marketing. There are even a few scenes that try to push a moral, despite being nonsensical gag scenes that really have no bearing on the actual story!\n\nYou know what, this story would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been a great one-off movie. Cut the stupid gags, cut the incessant flashbacks, cut the girls\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 \u00e2\u0080\u009cdoing cute things.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Just keep the real story, keep the expedition stuff, and sure, keep the dead mom. It would make a decent feel-good inspirational story a la the Hallmark Channel. Maybe even cut some of the non-stop crying, screaming, and insert songs with sad piano backing because it makes you feel the emotions.\n\nNo real comments on the animation. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing special. They ham up the facial expressions and body language, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the whole thing. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never distracting in a good or bad way. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just functional. The music is standard piano/wind instrument emotional fluff that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d expect from a sad commercial or conflict in a rom-com.\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bland, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disappointing, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full of senseless moeblobs with incredibly trope-filled and uninspired writing. I wouldn't call it terrible, but I definitely do not recommend this anime. 4/10.\n\n\n"}, {"id": 3548, "score": 46, "body": "One thing we sure known about \u00e2\u0080\u009cHand Shakers\u00e2\u0080\u009d is how bad this anime goes. It has a poor script, an animation which at least takes a few attempts in some aspects except things that I consider bad, cliche and generic characters, and plots that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen thousands of times in other anime. You could say it like \u00e2\u0080\u009cGuilty Crown,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a story about a person unexpectedly pull a weapon inside the main heroine where they both have to be together, for some stories but the part when \u00e2\u0080\u009cGuilty Crown\u00e2\u0080\u009d does is quite cool while \u00e2\u0080\u009cHand Shakers\u00e2\u0080\u009d is one of the worst anime of the season. There were so many anime I watched in that season besides this such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cKonoSuba 2,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cMasamune-kun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Revenge,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cGabriel DropOut,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cInterviews With Monster Girls,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cUrara Meirocho,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cSeiren,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the TV version of \u00e2\u0080\u009cLittle Witch Academia.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There were some that I dropped also which it was a different case, I wanted to finish it ASAP after \u00e2\u0080\u009cSteins;Gate 0\u00e2\u0080\u009d which just finished airing in this day. For some reason, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHand Shakers\u00e2\u0080\u009d could be said a \u00e2\u0080\u0098good\u00e2\u0080\u0099 anime in some parts, especially I admit that the art style gives an interesting unique impression if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think too much about the CGI. In a nutshell, this anime summarizes everything in the first episode like I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve watched \u00e2\u0080\u009cOccultic;Nine\u00e2\u0080\u009d but this anime is capable of redeeming itself rather than \u00e2\u0080\u009cHand Shakers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like you know is bad at first yet as you watch more, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even worse.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHand Shakers\u00e2\u0080\u009d can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be said a \u00e2\u0080\u009cso bad it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good\u00e2\u0080\u009d anime such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cBoku no Pico\u00e2\u0080\u009d which means even though I mention this one piece of 5-star anime doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean I like it. In addition, there are \u00e2\u0080\u009cMars of Destruction\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cTenkuu Danzai Skelter+Heaven.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like combining one of the best-worst directors ever such as Ed Wood and Tommy Wiseau. However, because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s said to be as bad it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that the anime is unworthy but the bad things contained in this anime are what makes us enjoy it for the most part so we laugh with all those. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHand Shakers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the other hand, can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be included in those three anime. Long story short, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever watched \u00e2\u0080\u009cGuilty Crown,\u00e2\u0080\u009d maybe you know the basic knowledge of this anime. In short, this anime is set in a vivid future background where the world is surrounded by the Hand Shakers, a term that refers to a partner who can summon \u00e2\u0080\u0098Nimrodes.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a term related to weapons when the Hand Shakers hold hands together. The point of this Hand Shakers is to go beyond the level to challenge the \u00e2\u0080\u0098God.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 You guess it, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an anime that tries to take any references from the Bible like the synopsis said, the receivers of the revelation of Babel. They are Hand Shakers who try to challenge God and would be given a demand by the Hand Shakers who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve wished. So, the whole idea that the plot is a bit interesting but not too provided in such a thoughtful way. There is some kind of \u00e2\u0080\u0098breaking the rules\u00e2\u0080\u0099 about this anime where when the main character repeatedly releases his partner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand which is explained before if they separate then his partner die. Besides, I still don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand how the rules work even though at the end of the episode was revealed, the director is like: \u00e2\u0080\u009cthink of the way like something fictional, not using your dumb logic you dumbass.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Is this a video game like most of the RPG-based anime? Is this some kind of supernatural that just appears like that? Who made the game or the world? If so, would there be an effect on the world from the Hand Shakers and reality? Or is this some kind of tournament? Or the director just wants to get rid of this anime and give it directly to the audience\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind? No one knows at the end of the episode other than the unaired 13th if you bought DVD Blu-ray features.\n\nWhen I wanna talk about the main character, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worse than the main character of \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn Another World With My Smartphone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While Touya Mochizuki, one of the luckiest characters, the most overpowered, lacking motivation, and not having any weaknesses at all is something I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to remember again from the anime itself. But, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve watched \u00e2\u0080\u009cHand Shakers\u00e2\u0080\u009d and this could take the cakes. The first episode is indeed done in forced ways and wants to attract more attention to the otaku who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve watched too many shows like this. We were introduced to Tazuna and Koyori, one of the Hand Shakers who accidentally met and became the part of the game. Koyori who had a strange body condition made a lot of hassles for the main character yet farther, the more you watched that this character such an overpowered character just like that which there is no any explanation at all. Tazuna was a normal student who accidentally met Koyori without any clear reason. Besides he had no motivation whatsoever other than assuming Koyori was his younger sister who had died so he wanted to protect her, he is like a villain in this anime. He thwarted all of the Hand Shakers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 struggles which more had strong wishes why they became the Hand Shakers and I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really know why all antagonists that Tazuna defeated became friends. The process between this pair of Hand Shakers was quite forced especially when they explained all the way in that world which they would not be able to let go of their hands, the director is more pushing the rules instead they have to bathe together. Yeah, take a bath together. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the way you like it. In addition, there is a romantic relationship between these two characters which I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know where they can understand each other and where is it, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know because there is no strong reason why Koyori who cannot speak wants to always be with Tazuna unless she just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be alone, maybe. It has a long yet tedious dialogue and over-information that feel boring, the basic concept feels monotonous and you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do anything.\n\nBesides them, there are other Hand Shakers which, as I said. There is Riri Houjou with her younger brother who is also just to bring up some incest thing or something like that just to add some impressions related to otaku, for some, who was so excited about it. In fact, this anime is one year after the death of incest thing I remember except \u00e2\u0080\u009cSword Art Online\u00e2\u0080\u009d or some shit like that. Other characterizations as well, regardless from having strong reasons to become the Hand Shakers, are forgettable and told in randomly and irrelevant manner so that they seem to only appear in the action part, fail to fight for their dreams and make friends with the main character. Repeated again and you got this anime. They repeat it more or less until five times except for the fourth battle against Kodama Awaza and Hibiki feels like the final fight of the last episode compared to the final confrontation that revealed everything. The post-credit shows some further information and segments about the second season, perhaps, or the OVA episode but never aired like \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn Another World With My Smartphone\u00e2\u0080\u009d where they also used the same technique.\n\nThere are two things that distinguish how they used two different styles for the art: the first is the CGI along with the choreography and the art style is usually the one colorful but some good parts are there even though they fail to design those things. The choreography is awful especially the dynamic cinematography. When they showed the CGI, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like their surroundings are so wide and just like a copy-paste of background and after that, it turns into a normal style and their surroundings immediately look crowded, unlike the CGI. In a nutshell, the characters seem to be in a wide expanse of land with wide settings and they use one-shot techniques to take a shot from any angle. In addition, the director seemed to be very inspired by Michael Bay\u00e2\u0080\u0099s explosion technique. The more explosions, the more exciting the action will be. I want to give a shout out about how they use the character of the movement especially the crowded one in lifely way but they only used one repeated frame. There are several parts that I notice how they take real life pictures but the background is like a green screen just sticks to it as if it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t blend together. Some parts that I notice like the chains seem to be only in the form of an image that has three frame rates per second as if an image is repeated like a GIF. For the most part, only a few are indeed good for the art. The rest, you just wanna close your eyes. The audio uses repetitive composition without any emotion at all, especially in the soundtrack both of the action and emotion sequence. While the opening and the ending theme songs I found it decent along with the voice actor, Sumire Morohoshi as Koyori is the shortest one. The heroine only has a script in the form of \u00e2\u0080\u009chuh\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009chmmm\u00e2\u0080\u009d without any dialogue even though there are certain reasons too. But, seven or eight episodes, if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not mistaken? Why does matter? This character can only be said \u00e2\u0080\u009chuh\u00e2\u0080\u009d at here and \u00e2\u0080\u009chuh\u00e2\u0080\u009d at there with her emotionless expressions to look like a moe or something like that. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really know it.\n\nYou know it when you make a shit and combine with other shit, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like playing all three of Zelda\u00e2\u0080\u0099s game series on the Philips CD-i platform in one day sitting in your couch, you must be finished before tomorrow. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHand Shakers\u00e2\u0080\u009d is intended for certain people who prefer a mainstream trope or cliche I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always seen in various anime. With the first episode impressed like big boobs of fanservice, it can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be said a \u00e2\u0080\u0098so bad it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good\u00e2\u0080\u0099 anime but this is the worse. It has a weak background with some kind of interesting premise, not too neat storyline, superficial characterization especially for other characters except for the main character, the art in can be said good for some parts but doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change the facts, it can be said as an \u00e2\u0080\u0098anime.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 The animation, cinematography, and music are so generic, almost everything. The ending cannot be said as an ending with a clear explanation because they try to push beyond the main characters so that they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bring up a clear conclusion. You know, Napoleon Bonaparte once said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cImagination rules the world\u00e2\u0080\u009d which means this is a high-low imagination in order to understand this anime."}, {"id": 3552, "score": 35, "body": "Every season of anime always has that one show. You know the one. From the start it receives constant praise and love by the masses, unrelenting in their desire to make their short-lived adoration known to any that will hear. For weeks it leads the figurative hype-train that has every seasonal watcher on board in anticipation to see where it will end up. Its the show you stay up late at night each week just to catch the latest episode on Kis-Crunchyroll.com. While every other show with potential may and probably will squander around the half-way point, this show \u00e2\u0080\u0093 THIS SHOW \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is the only one to matter, for it holds the embodiment of why weeaboos traded their social life to solely watch Japanese cartoons.\n\n__Newsflash: This ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it__.\n\nTo be honest, this season as a whole has been remarkably unremarkable given the obvious trends that take place in the anime community. Although it may not be so surprising given that the season prior was coined by many as \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Greatest Season of Anime\u00e2\u0080\u0099, even the most popular shows airing currently have made little more than a murmur throughout their runtime. Attack on Titan, Overlord, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cfinal\u00e2\u0080\u009d season of Gintama, all well-known series that have all fallen silent amongst the public. But when it comes to new series airing, Grand Blue had to have been a main attraction; based on one of the most popular manga serialized today that features Shinji Takamatsu as director \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the same director for successful comedies School Rumble and Daily Lives of High School Boys. Yet\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 something\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seriously off about this show, and since it seems to have slapped the tactfulness out of me, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just gonna go ahead and say it: This show fucking blows. \n\nI was planning to say something along the lines of \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dive into this\u00e2\u0080\u009d, but whilst being the most clich\u00c3\u00a9 cringe-inducing pun I could have possibly made, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not very much at all to \u00e2\u0080\u009cdive\u00e2\u0080\u009d into here. Grand Blue follows 20-year-old Iori Kitahara who has moved to his uncle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seaside town for college, where he is almost immediately roped into joining a male-dominated diving club. But if you thought this show was about diving, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a trap! Instead the club activities more or less revolve around drinking, stripping and getting hammered. Essentially, it is a comedy anime focused on the college life so a basic plot such as this is harmless so long as the comedy hits its mark. However, that simply is not the case. Instead Grand Blue comes off as an American frat house flick turned into a gag anime, except with nearly all the effort sucked out. \n\nNow I understand that comedy in general is heavily subjective so what personally may not land well with me could very well come off as a massive hit to someone else. Nevertheless, I have so many issues with how the show handles humour. One of the first instances of this come from the running joke where every other character tries tricking Iori into getting drunk. Conceptually, this does not strike me as humorous, but the ridiculous ways this is tried alongside dysmorphic character faces utilized certainly add to the punchline and made me laugh the first few times. But a cardinal problem with Grand Blue is that a joke which becomes par runs the risk of growing dull, and while using different scenarios can keep things fresh, Grand Blue instead drives them into the ground as fast as possible. Sure, the joke earned a few chuckles the first couple times, but then they use it once more, and again, and again\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and again. Numerous times the overabundance of these quips was akin to beating a dead horse, and if at that point it does not feel overdone then I just do not know what to say. Clearly Grand Blue is a comedy show that lends itself to multiple running gags throughout the 12 episodes, but the way they are used is what inevitably ceases the series to deliver the same results on viewers like myself. \n\nAnother issue with the comedy presented here more often than not is the timing. Timing is obviously a key factor for basically any form of comedy, especially with the kind of jokes Grand Blue exploits that rely heavily on the punchline. Yet here poor timing is so apparent that it comes off almost amateurish by the staff. Maybe this is a limitation when adapting the source material. I have not read the manga, but due to anime being\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 animated, it limits the way one can interpret a scene compared to a series of still pictures; the anime ends up much more restricting on the imagination. The punchlines themselves are also somewhat confusing at first if you had high expectations of Grand Blue without having read the manga. The series seems to treat comedy at a fairly lowbrow level where majority of the time punchlines were aimed between the more innocent characters being coerced or embarrassed by other club members. Sure, lowbrow humour can be funny and even I find it hilarious sometimes, but considering this is also a light-hearted comedy, makes Grand Blue\u00e2\u0080\u0099s task of making someone like myself laugh incredulously difficult. What also works in their disfavour are the more heartfelt moments mainly centred around Iori gaining appreciation for diving as a whole. These moments COULD have been useful as far as getting better invested in his character, except there is one serious problem: he has no character. You should not expect much in the way of development or characterization presented as there are only a handful of character worth remembering just to remember the plot meanwhile everyone else, despite their own \u00e2\u0080\u009cplot\u00e2\u0080\u009d are flat as a pancake. Again, due to Grand Blue being primarily comedy, there is barely any expectations as far as the narrative or characters go, yet the show continues to spread itself thin that I, as a viewer, am left with barely anything to truly grasp onto. Maybe I'm just an old fag :(\n\nPerhaps the key problem I have with Grand Blue is not with the comedy or even the characters, but the subject matter. There has been an increasing amount of anime set in higher education as of late, each with their own take on a core aspect of college life. But before Grand Blue I had never been exposed to one that focuses primarily on the parts where the main characters get blasted off one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, and after watching this, it really does makes sense why. As a student myself I can tell you with assurance that there is not much fun getting shit-faced and even then, it does not last long. To those reading this that have experienced a hangover probably understand this most and, perhaps more importantly, the after-effects. Headaches, drowsiness, poor concentration and nausea are just a mere few of the symptoms that coincidentally are also felt when watching these moments every week. One of the most common appraisals about Grand Blue is how relatable the show is. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry but the main aspects that are relatable to real life here are not things that I would be celebrating as much and like those who have had poor hangovers, is something I would rather forget about. Although when it comes to alcohol in Grand Blue, there is nothing more depressing than seeing each episode open with a disclaimer about legal alcohol usage. Now, they were probably necessary to even have the series airing in the first place but way to present the exact opposite of comedy at the beginning of each episode. Of course nothing is mentioned about the nudity seemingly ever-present here; I see Japan has their priorities straight here.\n\nSpeaking of; yes, I am a straight cis-male with no interest in the male nudity displayed in Grand Blue, but holy hell do they have the least creative way of censoring dicks. As aforementioned I have not read the manga, so I do not know how scenes were drawn but it is such a lazy way of going about it, though it does match the effort that arguably went to the overall visuals of Grand Blue. It looks absolutely lacklustre. Below average animation for practically every scene. Poor designs, even for the male supporting cast (no homo). This is not a series to watch for its technical appeal, because there practically is none. However, I find this fact to somehow work in its favour as far as the entertainment goes. Seeing comedic scenes with laughable animation effects certainly has a charm to it; perhaps a \u00e2\u0080\u009cso bad it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good\u00e2\u0080\u009d quality, but not enough to warrant slogging through it all. Even fanservice for the male demographic was at a minimum. As far as the sound, both the soundtrack and voice acting are very forgettable. The opening and endings, whilst memorable, I personally found cringeworthy. Never will I not skip either if they ever happen to come up on a playlist.

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear that not many people will agree with my statements as it appears to be a strong fan-favourite of whatever is left of the community still interested in seasonal anime. If you like it then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad you enjoyed it, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably better comedies this season. Watch them; I thought this sucked. Grand Blue was the equivalent of a grand disaster in my eyes and stands a reminder that \u00e2\u0080\u009cin every age, in every place, the taste of weeaboos remain the same.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I guess I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just not a fan of watching something akin to what the Fairy Tail guild would be like when knocked off their rocker.

Au revoir.\n"}, {"id": 3581, "score": 8, "body": "It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been over a year since the demon known as Hand Shakers, terrorized the land. It has been over a year since it had been slain. It has been over a year since the community at large celebrated their victory.\n\n3 months after the warriors of MyAnimeList finished their assault, a hatchling had been born. Son of Hand Shakers, it was called. No one knew why it was produced, as the purpose it would set out to fulfil was done so by Hand Shakers already. People had been anticipating the day it would enrage the community. However, it was late. So late, in fact, that everyone let their guard down. Now the beast has appeared to make his move. The fiend is weak; only one man is needed to slay him. This young man views the demon, sharpening the sword of ostentatious criticism and rage.\n\nIt sounds similar, though the noise it makes at least makes some sense, at least at first. The lazy, overblown, stock look its predecessor had, carried over almost as hideously. It doesn't have the army of abominable caricatures that we're so dreadful from before; it has younger, more benign versions of them. The sheer lack of movement makes this an easy target; it is cake compared to the vomit that came yesteryear. It means nothing, it is nothing, and soon it would prove to be less than that.\n\nSomehow the field is wiped, contradicting the rules of its predecessor being that the field has to be empty aside from combatants in order for a fight to commence. It's true colors are revealed, spouting the same lacking movements over and over in a sloth-like attempt at movement. The attacks displayed have no actual movement. It's revolting and pointless attempts to appeal to emotion fall on deaf, outraged ears, as the beast is silenced. No tears were wept by anyone other than shallow caricatures.\n\nThe absolutely contradictory snooze of a fight is over. It was boring, insulting even. At least frames didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t dip like last time. Regardless, the demon deserved to be slain, and the final corpse has been spat upon. It may not be as abominable or long-lasting as what came before, but the mere existence of this was pointless. No legacy is left behind; spite and bitterness are all that remain.\n\nGood riddance, for all of eternity, family of the Hand Shakers."}, {"id": 3587, "score": 45, "body": "~~~img(https://i.imgur.com/OwSXqPq.png)~~~\n# ~~~This review contains __unmarked__ spoilers for the original Steins;Gate.~~~\n# ~~~It __does not__ spoil Steins;Gate 0 itself.\n~~~\n\n#Review in brief:\n\nSteins;Gate 0 is a rough showing in a much beloved series that goes from cringey to alright to bad at the drop of a hat for its entire duration with few exceptions.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not without its moments, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re so few and far between that it bears a serious question: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs this story worth being told?\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Unless depression, memes, and a handful of clich\u00c3\u00a9s can hold your interest over the vast majority of the anime an honest \u00e2\u0080\u009cyes\u00e2\u0080\u009d will be hard to give.\n\n# Review in full:\n\nWelcome to the beta attractor field, where resident sad scientist Okabe Rintaro makes a half-hearted go at preventing inevitable calamity by talking to an AI, helping an amnesiac, and generally being depressed in his all-black clothes.  The viewer is expected to already know how this story begins and ends; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the story of how Okabe gets over his failures, refuses to let the world become a dystopia/perpetual warzone, and forges the plan to save Kurisu and reach Steins Gate.  That said, as far as Steins;Gate 0 is concerned, the story itself is almost completely the first of those three parts, i.e. the story of how Okabe gets PTSD from remembering Moeka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existence for a while and rarely breaks out of his defeatism & submission to fate.  As such, Okabe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s depression is not well-handled and isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t an entertaining story either unless depression is your guilty pleasure.\n\nOf course the Steins;Gate series is no stranger to initially slow plots, but there are key differences here.  The original\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slow start was acceptable and even enjoyable for many because it was a slowly-unfolding tale about some weirdos messing around with alternate timelines using a machine built with a cell phone, a microwave that turned bananas into green jelly, mental instability, and the landlord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 42\u00e2\u0080\u009d CRT TV (without permission).  It was a plot that invited silliness while working with many mysterious & genuinely-intriguing facets until things got serious in a sudden twist that was subtly hinted at, but _surely_ wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen in such a silly slice-of-life.\n\nSteins;Gate 0 doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have this start (or middle) at all.  The audience already knows there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time travel involved, so we get an AI that merely serves as a plot device and side character instead of working as the dynamic element time travel was and is in the series.  Instead of building odd gadgets, Okabe and his friends reflect on how useless they feel while not finishing odd gadgets. Okabe is so depressed that it rubs off on Mayuri in certain ways, leaving a heavily flanderized Faris, barely-existent Nae, Prof. Alexis \u00e2\u0080\u009cMeme-Machine\u00e2\u0080\u009d Leskinen, and sometimes Daru to \u00e2\u0080\u009cspice things up\u00e2\u0080\u009d with randomness, memes, references to Steins;Gate, old Steins;Gate memes, Daru\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gentleman pervert antics, a K-On! reference, and sometimes even an actual joke.  Some may find said humor decent enough for what it is, but those who expect more than references and \u00e2\u0080\u009cle random\u00e2\u0080\u009d tier memery could easily find it unable to balance the anime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overarching aura of depression.\n\nThe slow part of the anime drags on until roughly episode 18, leaving much less room for the thriller aspect Steins;Gate 0 clearly wants to replicate.  Even so the \u00e2\u0080\u009cheavy\u00e2\u0080\u009d parts of the story miss their mark more often than they hit.  A blatantly-flagged carbon copy of one of the original Steins;Gate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s events serves as a total mockery, soldiers often have such bad accuracy and combat awareness that they make storm troopers look like SEAL Team 6, the villain reveal can be seen from a mile away and plays out like a bad fan faction, and plenty more that is too spoilery to bring up.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not helped by the regular use of \u00e2\u0080\u009caction scenes\u00e2\u0080\u009d, effectively slide-shows with slightly-moving images in most cases interspersed with awkward breaks for dramatic dialogue mid-fight.\n\n<center>img(https://i.imgur.com/13hILHH.gif)\n_This anime adapts Steins;Gate 0's \"beginner\" difficulty._</center>\n\nThese are interlaced with numerous plot contrivances & inconsistencies, enough to make the attentive viewer start to consider if this is actually a side story in an alternate universe with different rules.  Time travel itself bends its consistency, with events that ought to result in paradox yet don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, plus the explanation as to why the Time Leap Machine was limited to two days (because beyond that point the user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mental state would be too different, resulting in likely damage) is ignored at times.\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not all bad news though, as there are still a handful of standout serious moments to be had.  One unexpected twist brings developments that add to the overall story and blunts the anime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s initial angst to a degree.  Getting to see just how other characters cope (or struggle to cope) with Kurisu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death, Okabe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resulting depression, and other similar & related events shows us sides of characters like Daru & Mayuri that hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been touched upon much prior.  Finally, there <i>is</i> a point where the show somewhat refreshes itself, and though it may be too little too late for those truly expecting a thriller, it results in some memorable moments that hold some small amount of merit, all things considered.\n\nSuch moments of merit are likely enough to remind a viewer who was otherwise put-off by other parts of the anime why they decided to watch it in the first place, or perhaps even the Steins;Gate series as a whole.  More forgiving (or ignorant) fans could very well remember the anime based on these moments, which will likely be mentioned many times over to defend the anime and show that there are indeed clear & valid reasons to rate it highly.  Unfortunately, someone watching with their brain turned on runs a high risk of having their rose-tinted glasses broken early on (if they had them to begin with).  Steins;Gate 0 relies heavily on nostalgia to deliver its impact and stick a fair portion of its humor, leading to a glaring issue for many ~ that it does little to stand on its own two feet.  Large portions of it effectively work as fanservice, and someone expecting an anime that is good __on its own__ won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have much to point to in the end.\n\nSuch is the conclusion I have come to in regards to Steins;Gate 0, though there are other aspects of the anime to mention for the sake of completeness.\n\nAs previously mentioned there are issues involving the visual quality.  White Fox clearly didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put as much budget into this as they did with Steins;Gate 7 years ago.  The amount of animation is minimized to a point where even someone such as myself who doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t view animation as a highly important quality in an anime (if it helps tell the story it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s usually good enough for me) was left wanting more of it.  The picture quality itself is simply average, save the occasional derp face (which leaks of the Blu-Ray release indicate as the main aspect being touched up post-airing).\n\nThe stylistic flare the original Steins;Gate had is not present here, and most frames are merely standard for the purpose of animating dialogue accompanied with basic motion ~90% of the time.  Character (re)designs come with two \"quirks\".  First you have Okabe's all-black attire, because _clearly_ we aren't smart enough to tell that he's depressed.  Second, it turns out that the B in beta attractor field stands for \u00e2\u0080\u009cbreast expansion\u00e2\u0080\u009d as the returning female cast grew by one or two cup sizes.  Less focus on plot, more focus on _plot_, sounds like a normal day in anime land.\n\n<center>img480(https://i.imgur.com/uR7LqQ4.png)\n_Gee I wonder why. If only Steins;Gate 0 could give us a ~~subtle~~ visual ~~metaphor~~ for the entire line of dialogue._</center>\n\nThe audio quality fares better, partially thanks to returning elements such as certain talented seiyuu and some of Steins;Gate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s noteworthy soundtrack.  The new songs are distinguishable from each other, fitting for their usage, fit the reused compositions, and make use of a passable leitmotif.  The OP & standard EDs don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hold up as well, though the special EDs are a nice touch.  Voicework is a mixed bag, with some voices done very well despite the circumstances within the show (including the voices for Mayuri, Daru, & Maho considering the varied emotions they experience).  At the same time Amadeus (Kurisu) always sounds like she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been awake for two days straight and Okabe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actor was clearly enthused to be voicing him again, so much so that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s noticeable at times and in ways where \u00e2\u0080\u009centhused\u00e2\u0080\u009d isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t how Okabe is portrayed (and can be overbearing in scenes where he is).\n\nSpeaking of portrayals, Steins;Gate 0 has some highlights and some issues with how it handles characterization.  It features a sizable cast, sizable enough to where it can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put enough attention into all of the cast to give everyone a clear purpose.  Faris is there because why not, Ruka is there so that Okabe feels more stressed in two scenes and for the obligatory \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a guy\u00e2\u0080\u009d joke, Mayuri\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cosplaying friends only exist because one develops a plot hook that is mentioned twice and left unused & forgotten, and another is Daru\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future wife.  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also the unfortunate case of Kagari, whose subplot is split into three chunks, always coming in just when something else seems to actually be starting up, and never wraps up all of its loose ends, rendering her as little more than an annoyingly used plot device that totally looks just like Kurisu if you ignore her ridiculous bust.\n\nSome characters turn out quite well though.  Mayuri & Daru are given plenty of serious moments to develop and/or flesh out, which better establishes why they are crucial to Okabe and his journeys.  They end up taking responsibilities Okabe shrugs off in his depression, filling larger roles as lab members than simply \u00e2\u0080\u009csuper hacker\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cperceptive tuturuu-chan\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  As for new characters, Maho could easily be accused of being a fill-in Kurisu, but she has her own character and while she could have used more attention the developments involving her tend to be better rather than worse, and Prof. Leskinen makes an effective foil for her when he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not busy being Meme Man.\n\nThat leaves Okabe himself.  For all of his depressive moping in the story, he does slowly develop his way through in chunks, and the Okabe that formed the plan to deceive the world is made known.  However, this development simply mirrors the last stage of his development in the original Steins;Gate across 23 episodes instead of the 2-3 it originally took.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nice to see where he ends up, but mostly only because the anime dragged its feet every step of the way there.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not entirely bad by the end, but a rewatch of Steins;Gate will do the same thing in a much better way.\n\n# Verdict:\n\nSteins;Gate 0 is an unfortunate case of producers going for the cheap method of low cost & appealing to nostalgia to make a profit, as evidenced by the stunted production values, repeated use of old memes, and dry plot that overstays its welcome.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only on brief occasions that this anime partially digs itself out of that quagmire, much like Okabe with his depression.  It does have moments of merit deep down, but it's buried under so much junk that I can't quite say it's enough to make the experience worthwhile.  It takes a certain kind of person to forgive the multitude of flaws in Steins;Gate 0, someone I couldn't reasonably expect anyone to be."}, {"id": 3646, "score": 45, "body": "~~~img500(https://i.imgur.com/5pc2sWx.png)~~~\n \n___\n \n#Seeds of Anxiety#\n \nA collection of ultra short horror stories by [Masaaki Nakayama](https://anilist.co/staff/98581/Masaaki-Nakayama), Fuan no Tane was... disappointing, to say the least. Seventy two chapters, and there were eleven stories that I thought were either maybe genuinely a bit creepy or amusing in a horror way.\n \nBut the majority of Fuan no Tane is just... usually dialogue and then the last page shows you the spooky face or the spooky monster. There's rarely ever any purpose or meaning for it either. It's not like somebody died and like that's their ghost tormenting the people in the chapters... no, it's usually just an outright random spooky face.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/BgAvOok.png)\n \nAs several chapters really are just two pages long, there's just not enough time to even try to put a story or anything resembling atmosphere. I think I really do have no better way to describe this as a manga version of [Yami Shibai](https://anilist.co/anime/19383). It's just like a clipshow of a bunch of creepy faces. Maybe some of them will get you to say \"oh that looks creepy\" but beyond that there's really... nothing deeper to latch onto.\n \nAs a matter of fact, if it weren't for like those eleven stories, I'd maybe go as far to say this borderline bottom of the barrel. Like there's just one chapter that starts with like the giant shadow of a guy, but then the rest of the story is just talking about a warning sign.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/31xwhwP.png)\n \nI mean if this sign were meant to warn people of spooky ghost activity, then I would think something more than an exclamation point would be needed! Like... what a terrible fucking warning sign! Unless... unless maybe the _WARNING SIGN ITSELF IS THE GHOST._\n \nJoking aside, I get that the point of the manga is more about like trying to get the reader to feel anxious. Like the stories are split into different categories and the stories are usually very general. Along the lines of \"have you ever seen weird out of the corner of your eye??? Maybe it's ghosts!\" but it's just... a lot of it is just lame.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/yRYe1QZ.png)\n \nReally, in my opinion, what little fun stuff there is in this manga lie more in the weirder stuff. It's not just a stupid spooky horror face, it's genuinely something weird and it's not even ever necessarily found out by anyone. Or just outright ignored. Like I think my favorite story of Fuan no Tane is the one about an entire hospital's staff outright ignoring the spirit of a baby because it's an ugly baby with a crazy horror mouth, but all it's doing is asking is to be hugged and paid attention to.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/Yuy2i5E.png)\n \nLike that's actually genuinely kind of disturbing. And also sad. I guess yeah the argument can be made that it's actually evil and it's lying but what if it really is just the spirit of a deceased baby and this entire hospital's nursing staff has just outright agreed to completely ignore it? Given that the punch of the majority of this manga's stories is \"woah that's a spooky face!\", I'm probably just putting too much thought into it though...\n \nI feel like I should also clarify that it's not so much that it's overly reliant on the \"creepy/spooky faces\" method of horror, but that the faces aren't even that good half of the time.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/qAv1JD1.png)\n \nLike one of the only chapters like that which honestly kind of worked for me was like a guy goes to clean up the apartment his brother used to live in and he sees like attached to the ceiling like a bit of cut rope like a noose. He ends up going to sleep in the apartment after a bit of cleaning and what happens?\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/nlt3zjF.png)\n \nWhoops, I guess I shouldn't have slept directly underneath where someone hung themselves! Like the idea of waking up to the ghost of someone who hung himself *directly* over you is indeed creepy. This manga could have used way more of that than oh my god there is a fucking ghost looking into my window at me _oh my GOOOOOOOOOOOOOD_\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/Pjc6f4H.png)\n \n___\n \n#No, sorry. It wasn't a ghost. I was just seeing shit out of the corner of my eye.#\n \n_Oh yeah and it also really doesn't help that 90% of the time it also ends directly after you're shown the spooky face. Rarely ever get to see the character's reactions or them just saying \"oh hello\" to the horror faces. Again, it's the manga version of Yami Shibai..._\n \nTo conclude, I'm going to do something I don't do for most of the other things I review and include the numbers of the chapters that I think are genuinely worth reading more than any of the utterly generic spooky ones.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/QVtOb6w.png)\n \nIf the collection was of just these stories rather than the full 72, I'd probably give it a way higher score but I guess you can't release like a three volume manga of just like eleven five page long stories.\n \n_14, 16, 24, b2, b7, b10, b14, b18, \u00ce\u00a98, \u00ce\u00a917, \u00ce\u00a920_\n \n...I'd give the entire collection probably a __4.5 out of 10__ or __45 out of 100__, though. It's competent, it's a quick read, but there's no real substance and I've already forgotten eighty percent of the stories so...\n \nNah. If you want creepy faces sure, but deep or lasting horror? Nah.\n \n~~~img500(https://i.imgur.com/e7mCnnL.png)~~~\n"}, {"id": 3671, "score": 30, "body": "...Can we just skip this one? No? Are you sure? I'm pretty sure we can skip this one and it'll be fine.

I'm talking about the people who hated it and dropped it out of seemingly ___vehement disgust___.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/SDZ4GjQ.gif)\n \nTo me, it wasn't edgy enough. It wasn't gory enough, it wasn't bad enough, and it wasn't funny enough. It might partially be a result of the transition from manga into anime... like maybe there's some edgier stuff that was just toned the fuck down or something.\n \nBut yeah, episode one was the closest this series had me going. The over the top tragedy stuff with Asagiri was wonderful. When she was talking about like wanting to die, I kind of couldn't think of a rebuttal. Because of what we're shown of her life, it's basically a living nightmare.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/cgOLGgm.png)\n \nShe gets the shit kicked out of her and is tormented at school, then she comes home and gets the shit kicked out of her by her sadist brother, and her parents just completely do not give a single shit.

Girls who have suffered horrible and terrible lives who are given magical girl powers and then just go on fuckin' RAMPAGES of viscera everywhere.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/FVXHB9c.png)\n \nInstead no. Instead fucking no. Like that shit is immediately thrown out of the window once episode one is done. The show just immediately becomes finding out more about the site and magical girls entering a conflict between the entities that run the Mahou Shoujo Site. And...\n \n...that was just supremely boring to me the entire way through. I just could not care less about it.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/E5HpghT.png)\n \nBut the Tempest is gonna be an apocalyptic event and... I just did not give a single fuck. Like there's a point in the show where they describe like a way better version of this show, and that's like the idea that there's a contest of like winning your way to be guarantee your survival once the Tempest hits.\n \nBut the way to win the contest is you have to be like the magical girl who causes the most pain and suffering. Why couldn't that have been the show. Why couldn't that have been the fucking show.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/JrzhNYr.png)\n \nYet no, we gotta battle the Mahou Shoujo Site! Which... in addition to not caring much at all about, I'm not sure how I or anyone was expected to ever take seriously. Like I started laughing every single time they showed like the table with all of the site administrators around it. Wow, they look so spooky! I'm so scared!\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/7CNlN6Y.png)\n \nThese idiots are pissed off that the magical girls are using their powers against the site because they learned about the Tempest but how did they learn about the Tempest...? Oh, the way the site's programmed is if you click a certain part of a site administrator's body, that'll take you to another section of the site that is a literal countdown to this mysterious apocalyptic event that the site administrators seem very in favor of happening.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/OqSktSv.png)\n \nMaybe... maybe you should have... not had that be visible? On your site? That you run? You're the ones running the site so if you didn't want them to find out about that then WHY LET THEM BE ABLE TO ACCESS THAT?\n \nReally, apart from I guess episode one, the closest times I was ever entertained through this show was when Asagiri's brother was on the screen or talking.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/lxbUO47.png)\n \nThat [voice actor](https://anilist.co/staff/95270/Nobuhiko-Okamoto) knew exactly what was he doing and was just being as over the top and insane sounding ~~and annoying~~ as he possibly could. When the brother just starts full on fucking with the magical girls in spite of whatever's currently happening with the site, I was honestly very entertained.\n \nBut good things of course have come to an end, and the show returns to the bland magical battles and talking about the site and I just... ugh.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/pyIcAPu.png)\n \n___Completely boring!___ I guess apart from Asagiri's brother, I kind of liked Asagiri's friend. ~~Though I've forgotten her name at this point.~~ But that's about all the things I can think of even praising. Like the edgy parts or the parts where some of the magical girls were acting insane were... fun? It's... it's still just not enough.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/6BzerVf.png)\n \nMaybe there'll be another magical girl and full on horror combination in the future that changes my mind (I doubt it), but I just don't think it works honestly. The spooky site administrators are just... they're just funny. I laughed or chuckled almost every single time they were on the screen and especially when they started battling with the magical girls. I would describe basically the entirety of this series as laughable.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/rwAEYlt.png)\n \nWhen the most entertaining parts of your series is when you're trying to be as dark and \"feel bad\" as you possibly can, and the rest of your series is just occasional magical battles or just talking about a spooky mascot website that's gonna bring about the apocalypse (_which of course sounds fun in concept but isn't in the execution_)... eh. Just... eh.\n \nA completely deserved __3 out of 10__. I probably wouldn't recommend it. It's not good, and it's not funny enough to be \"good bad.\" I guess when it comes down to it, all I'm saying is I really wish the entire series was about that brother character.\n \n~~~img500(https://i.imgur.com/C0ueBpn.png)~~~"}, {"id": 3673, "score": 35, "body": "This manga was good at first but then after a few more chapters, it became irritating to read. These are the reasons why:\n\nStory: It was too repetitive, to the point where there wasn't any development occurring. The relationship between the main characters don't change at all. There were obvious signs of both having feelings for each other but somehow they haven't noticed and when it so plainly obvious that If I had a friend who was in that situation, I would punch some sense into him and force him to say his feelings.\n\nCharacters: There are way too many incidents where Amano was flashing her panties or in some type of ecchi situation that didn't seem natural; Don't get me wring that happens all the time in other series but sitting down without properly fixing your skirt or not noticing your panties showing because you skirt is too short when her friends have already told her about these things is plain retarded and how she keeps hitting Manabu when he points it out trying to help her just like what her friends do for her. It pisses me off that she is that ungrateful and doesn't even learn from her constants mistakes.\n\nManabu isn't any better. He constantly get distracted by Amano from these ecchi moment and can't concentrate in his studies. No normal dude thinks that hard about a girl unless you like them. It amazes me how he doesn't even realize this; His denseness is worse than Ichika from Infinite Stratos. He didn't realize the obvious signs that his childhood friends likes him. How can you not tell?\n\nOther characters like main characters parents and friends already realize that they like each by seeing them together ONCE but decided to only give a little push but not actually help to progress their relationship.\n\nArt: Its good and probably the reason why I'm not giving this manga a lower score.\n\nEnjoyment: I actually liked it but I couldn't stand the denseness of the main characters and there was no development in their relationship at all. It was too frustrating to continue reading while knowing there was any exciting events happening and irritating that the main characters were in situations that could improve their romance but it never did. It's just frustrating.\n "}, {"id": 3674, "score": 35, "body": "\"Say, [I](https://anilist.co/staff/119464/Ryou-Hanada) have a pretty good and original idea for a new series.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"It's a series about vampires.

It's exactly what it is printed on the label of the tin. A male vampire saves a female human college student and then they forge a... a bond.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/NaoSwIv.png)\n\n...To be honest, maybe I'm just kind of crazy, but I just kept on continuing questioning why Tsukasa didn't initially find Anzai creepy at all. \n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/E8QjquY.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/DrEdwPR.png)~~~\n\nLike he just keeps showing up at her window in the middle of the night and she's just... fine with that.\n\nAlso...\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/IKwk8xh.png)\n\nI couldn't help but feel bad for Tsukasa's original friend in episode one who\n\n~!the entire thing is I guess that her friend whom in all actuality is secretly a vampire that is killing (and raping) other female students but in actuality loves Tsukasa. He's just diverting his violent and sexual urges away from Tsukasa to others. But Anzai is like all \"no humans and vampires can't have romantic relationships\" but then he just almost immediately starts repeatedly visiting Tsukasa after the original vampire friend is out of the picture and he and Tsukasa of course end up in a relationship.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/HwhSruF.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/QL3rO2P.png)\n\n...I can't believe I was tricked into watching vampire NTR.!~\n\nAlmost predictably, to me, the romance between Anzai and Tsukasa was for sure the worst part of this show. Like I absolutely just cannot get behind using\n\n~!attempted rape as a way to bring two characters closer together. Like I get it. The professor that tries to rape Tsukasa is human.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/9HcNaVe.png)\n\nAnd Anzai who is a vampire which are painted as bloodthirsty monsters is the one who ends up saving Tsukasa from being raped. So that only further drives her to be more comfortable around Anzai. But like... couldn't you have just tried to flesh out their relationship WITHOUT resorting to have her almost be raped? If it didn't feel entirely tacked on it'd be one thing but...\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/yjLjm8g.png)!~ \n\n...Really if you remove that, more or less the only other thing that's driving them towards each other is... well, lust. Which I guess is fine if what you're here to see is trashy vampire human romance. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/9NR8Nqa.png)\n\nBecause rather weirdly, while the government is apparently perfectly aware of vampires existing, like almost the sole thing that's discussed about the government regulating vampires is...\n\nVampires and humans having sex? \n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/Cih34ht.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/Bw58we2.png)~~~\n\nIt's apparently perfectly fine as long as there's a doctor overseeing it? I guess to assumingly stop the vampire if it goes out of control and fucking murders their mate during the process...? Like there's a goddamned secret police purposely for vampires and like a human group that's dedicated to bringing about their extermination, but rather than focus on that yeah let's focus on Anzai trying to temper and control his vampireness and _THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT IS FOR YOU AND TSUKASA TO GO INTO THIS BEDROOM WE'VE WIRED_.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/d6BDrBc.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/zliXbWt.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/alnosyw.png)~~~\n\nThis show honestly felt like it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what it wanted to be. Trashy vampire/human romance or trashy over the top vampire action. Like my eyes would be glazing over as the show would be focusing on Tsukasa and Anzai, but then all of a sudden like some random slasher would just show up and brutally kill a reporter with a knife. Immediately, my attention would be dragged back to the show.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/8LCy4Km.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/hof6HcI.png)~~~\n\nThe idea of humans exposing vampires who are just trying to stay under the radar by like pelting them with or showing them bags of blood is neat. Some of the action scenes are actually kind of entertaining. Trashy, but entertaining! But when it comes down to it, that's not the main focus of the show...\n\nThis, is the main focus of the show. Unfortunately.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/2d4pUzC.png)\n\nDevil's Line is bad, but beyond that, it's kind of fucking muddled. Could have been a full on trashy human vampire romance, or it could have been this trashy over the top vampire action. It tries to be both and it fails. And on top of that, because it's about vampires and has gore, it's another piece of garbage lobbed into the horror genre. Unfortunate.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/UPZ7sfq.png)\n\nA __3.5 out of 10__ or __35 out of 100__. I could probably see a situation to recommend this one in. If you want to watch some trashy romance with a side of over the top action then... fine.

But...the first episode of the anime basically spoils what this entire series is at the very start so... ~~and also kind of the ending.~~__\n\n__...Also considering what this series is about, you may or may not consider it... upsetting. Two in one warning!__\n___\n\n#Introduction\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/gUpggQK.png)\n\nHappy Sugar Life is a manga by [Tomiyaki Kagisora](https://anilist.co/staff/108563/Tomiyaki-Kagisora). I very rarely if ever read a manga after its adaptation is announced. I often prefer experiencing the anime and then going to the manga/original source. But in Happy Sugar Life's case, I was curious.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/koXpZcP.png)\n\nI read a single chapter and I just... hated it. Or putting it about as kindly as I can, I just didn't want to read any more of it. I wasn't curious about where it was gonna go and/or already figured I knew where it was heading.\n\n...Maybe it's mostly because of it now being in color, but I actually watched the whole way through Happy Sugar Life's anime. And... I did not *hate* it.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/TbqDYAH.png)\n\nLike let's just take a moment and consider the various other recent seasonal horror series. Or rather maybe just the season prior to this one, aka, Spring 2018. In that season, for horror, you had either edgy but boring magical girl battles or outright vampire/human smut. No atmosphere. Nothing unsettling. Nothing creepy. Nothing scary. Sure, there was gore in both, but who fucking cares! Anybody can have gore!\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/G6Gs57J.png)\n\nWith Happy Sugar Life, you have various psychologically unstable characters. You have sexual deviancy, you have murder, you have a guy so completely fucking out of his gourd that he's worshiping missing children posters. ~~And also gore! Not a huge amount, though!~~\n\nThis show, actually fucking requires a warning, that it may be disturbing.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/hV5P5Mw.png)\n\nA SERIES TAGGED AS HORROR THAT MAY ACTUALLY BE DISTURBING? SOUNDS TOO FUCKING GOOD TO BE TRUE, HONESTLY.\n\n...Unfortunately, it is. The premise is done completely wrong, the writing is absolute fucking garbage, the mood shifts are just completely fucking insane, the characters are almost exclusively deviants or all have problems in the head...\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/tu5WC8E.png)\n\nBut you know what? I'm counting it as a win. If that isn't illustrative of how low the goddamned bar for horror anime is, then I don't know what is. Like [Ezo'la](https://anilist.co/studio/6218/Ezola) took this piece of shit awful manga and adapted it... probably about as well as they possibly could have. True to the piece of garbage that spawned it, yet somehow a hell of a lot more tolerable.\n\n___Happy Sugar Life is a win!___\n\n...Now, with that out of the way... let's get this show on the road.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/otsJYc2.png)\n\n___\n\n#The First Episode Spoiler#\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/ldtJwva.png)\n\nI understand the purpose of the scene at the very start of this series with Satou and Shio on the roof. But the whole thing in the manga was that like you didn't immediately know what this series was yet. Sure, you probably assumed that the title Happy Sugar Life was probably a bit too... cheery of a title.\n\nEspecially if you saw the cover image of the manga.\nOr read the description.\n...Or looked at the genres.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/5gnc9Aq.png)\n\nThe point is, putting that scene there before even the reveal scene with Satou and the bags of the guy she originally murdered just completely fucking ruins any possible surprise there could have been. And was probably doubly confusing to anime only viewers. And as a person who read a tiny bit of the manga, it was a fucking gigantic spoiler, because yes, that's basically what the ending ends up being...\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/THh2C4d.png)\n\nIt immediately spoils that Shio ends up siding with Satou. Which in the context of this show was what I viewed as the absolute and utter worst possibility. This series is about Satou who is a psychotic, violent, and obsessive girl who is actively keeping this missing girl away from her family. Or at least, the one blood relative who is still actively searching for her.\n\nSatou should be the antagonist. But yet the first episode immediately hits you up with the fact that they're eventually going to apparently perform a double suicide in the future. Before literally ANYTHING is introduced.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/fwP8KHi.png)\n\nI want to say the fact that it's not just a completely pointless scene, aka, the fact that the anime eventually rolls back to it in the end makes it a bit better but... I definitely feel like they should have just not included that scene. At all.\n\n___\n\n#Worthless Characters#\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/NKxiLzB.png)\n\n_Remember her??? ...No? To be fair, I guess her sole contribution was raping Mitsuboshi..._\n\nThere are a lot of deviants and weirdos in this series. And there are two in particular who are just completely unneeded. Or rather, the show treated them as like actual supporting characters that I was supposed to be interested in seeing how they ended up following the conclusion of the show.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/YJTeAgX.png)\n\nThe weird teacher who pursues his female students. He's creepy, he's a deviant, but what does he add to the show, exactly? Like his entire purpose was just to be the way that Satou disposes of the remains of the guy she murdered to get the apartment she lives in with Shio.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/ZS6xSGU.png)\n\nBut then he begins to try and investigate what the fuck Satou is into but this is simultaneously happening when Satou's friend and Mitsuboshi are sniffing around, and eventually Satou finds out that the teacher is still lurking around and punishes him accordingly, and he is basically not relevant again until the very end of the show.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/Ws5AzWO.png)\n\nWhich I will of course return to later on my section on the ending, because I laughed very, very hard.\n\nThen you have one of Satou's other fellow female employees who is just... for absolutely no reason, obsessed with Satou. The teacher's purpose in the show while nebulous, I could kind of still understand.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/GW05SnM.png)\n\nThe girl obsessed with Satou is just I guess in there to include a yuri thing, I guess. Because after Satou kisses her, she just drops out of the show entirely until like the fun happy montage later in the show where she is shown getting Satou... passports? Oh.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/k3LXslr.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/geOhZBX.png)~~~\n\nSatou's aunt couldn't _ALSO_ get them passports...? We... we needed this other character for that for some reason...? And then just like the teacher, at the very end of the show, she's shown watching the news of what happens in the end as if she's a character that matters or EVER mattered.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/OTD8uOM.png)\n\n___\n\n#Deviancy and Psychological Damage#\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/NRhBfz8.png)\n\nGenuinely, outside of watching a trash fire, there were actually sections of this show I enjoyed. I really don't feel as if the characters or the story being told really warranted them, but I did enjoy the more psychological sections of the show. Whether it's what's happening with Shio, Mitsuboshi who following getting raped by an older woman just completely fucking snaps and immediately becomes obsessed with a little girl's missing posters, or Satou's aunt who is a complete fucking freak.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/lr8LOMj.png)\n\n~~No joke, Satou's aunt is absolutely my favorite character/deviant of this entire series. With all of these other broken or deviant characters who are pretending to still be kind of normal, she's completely wide eyed and completely fucking crazy 100% of the time she's shown. And we're never shown a reason for it. That's just the way she is.~~\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/DR8OP8q.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/Bc1EhT8.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/i3AgRkS.png)~~~\n\nLike I don't think I've ever seen a series where there is like almost no likable characters. It's just deviancy all the way down. Like later in the show, Mitsuboshi has finally realized he's kind of fucking crazy and wants to just try and be normal again, but Satou who needs someone to mislead the guy that is still actively searching for Shio, actively tries to inflame Mitsuboshi's desire for this LITTLE GIRL.\n\nI almost actually liked Mitsuboshi when he finally tried to get himself out of this show. He didn't want to be obsessed with Shio anymore, and he definitely didn't want to be involved in Satou's business.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/EL5j56b.png)\n\nIt's too bad Satou just happened to have one of Shio's socks in case she needed to entice a rape victim ___gone pedophile___.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/qv15ctC.png) img440(https://i.imgur.com/NKD99Sn.png)~~~\n\nOkay so even if I actually liked this show, and/or was somehow possibly cheering for Satou... at this point not only is she manipulating a guy who she is completely aware has been raped and was just clearly obsessed with Shio as like an outlet for that trauma, but she's also using Shio who she supposedly loves to do so? Granted, it's quite obvious that Satou has absolutely no intention of ever allowing Mitsuboshi to see Shio because she is actively pushing him forward in his obsession of her which means he's probably going to become even more unhinged but...\n\nI just can't contemplate viewing this series with any mindset other than \"Satou is the antagonist\" yet she's _the protagonist._\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/TgWlkA6.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/NO5TmnY.png)~~~\n\n___\n\n#Inconsistent Tone#\n\nAnd now, now I'm going to rail on probably one of the biggest things that bothers me about this series and it is also the central idea that the entire series is built around.\n\nHappy Sugar Life.\nBitter versus sweet.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/9CUuC0b.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/PsWTPDH.png)~~~\n\n_For the record, all of the times they forced the Happy Sugar Life line in there felt incredibly forced and lame._\n\nI think I'm probably in the minority on this one, but I enjoyed all of the darker stuff with the murders and the deviant characters a whole hell of a lot more than all the sections where Satou and Shio are together and things are just suddenly a lot brighter and happier. It's the entire idea of the series so it's not like you could change it without changing the entire series.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/ODFrED2.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/9bEgYa2.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/9N0Wppi.png)~~~\n\nLike I view it as one of those ideas that sound neat, but just doesn't work. Maybe it could, but I don't think it does with this execution. Granted, if it weren't for the completely inconsistent tone, my utmost favorite scene of the entire series (and arguably the best overall one) wouldn't work.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/lpbXPmy.png)\n\nSatou's friend had just discovered Satou's dark secret and after having an argument with her with an emotional song playing over what the former friends were saying to each other, Satou's friend is about to leave Satou's apartment with a new determination that she's going to try and save her friend from this dark path. _She'll never give up again!_\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/3uAPvPy.png)\n\n...\n\n__TGG:__ \"...This feels very unlike this sho--wait.\"\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/n2AUn2z.png)\n\n__TGG:__ \"There it is! Murder! Alright, now end.\"\n\n...\n\n__TGG:__ \"...wait. Oh god. It's still going? IT'S STILL GOING? SHE'S STRUGGLING WITH THE KNIFE IN HER NECK AND SHE'S CLAWING AT SATOU'S HANDS. WHAT. AN EFFECTIVELY HORRIFIC MURDER SCENE? FROM THIS SERIES? _WHAT!_\"\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/8Z8Twju.png)\n___\n\n#Complete Schlock Ending#\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/Roic3hw.png)\n\nCould argue that the entire show was schlock, but the ending really goes that extra mile. Like even if you're willing to give EVERYTHING ELSE a pass, there's just no forgiving this one.\n\nSatou who is obsessed with Shio forgets her ring that matches with Shio's after taking it off to prepare her friend's corpse so people think it's Satou herself that died in the fire they're gonna have started. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/9tzhOjO.png)\n\nShe then proceeds to completely forget her ring. Her \"wedding ring.\" Okay first of all, that completely goes against Satou's character. All she's ever cared about this entire goddamned series is Shio yet she's gonna forget her \"wedding ring\"?\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/1ClYE4o.png)\n\nYou could potentially make the argument that she forgot it as a result of having to face her friend's corpse because she clearly is at least partially still dealing with it.\n\nBut really, it's just completely transparent that this is just an excuse to have them return so they'd be found by Shio's brother. They could have made a completely clean getaway if Satou had either just not forgotten the ring at all, or just left anyways with Shio. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/4bVUtdh.png)\n\nInstead, they go back and it just happens to be when Shio's brother is going to the apartments, Mitsuboshi is there after having been raped a second time but this time by Satou's aunt, and Satou's aunt is preparing to set the apartment on fire. \n\n_Actually, I know she's completely fucking crazy, but why exactly is Satou's aunt so willing to do all this shit for Satou?_ \n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/bI8IkPY.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/M07bvDR.png)~~~\n\n_I know Satou herself blames how crazy she is on being raised by her crazy aunt but like... Satou acknowledging that she's fucked up kind of defeats the purpose, I feel. So she's fucked up, but she's also AWARE that her relationship with Shio is absolutely not normal and acceptable...??? What even happened to Satou's actual parents anyways? What?_\n\nIt just feels so lazily coincidental. Like oh, Shio's brother gets into Satou and Shio's apartment so he can discover Shouko's corpse.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/2li57ZG.png)\n\nHow... convenient. _All of the things happen all at once! Or in very quick sequential order!_\n\nThe ending results are... so baffling. Like okay, Shouko and Satou's corpses are found and they as well as the burned apartment building is conveniently blamed on the crazy aunt character. But then it shows police dragging off the deviant teacher character and he's crying and his family's there and... that implies they found the remains of the original guy Satou murdered and somehow found out that the teacher disposed of them...?\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/i8aagKv.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/dPYImgv.png)~~~\n\n_I was laughing so goddamned hard at this part I actually needed to pause._\n\nBut the guy Satou originally murdered is the one who owned the apartment that Satou and Shio lived in and that's the apartment where Shouko's corpse was in. Like it's not as if they moved Shouko's corpse to the apartment Satou's aunt and where Satou originally lived in. What the fuck was Shouko even doing there from the perspective of the authorities? What happened to the original guy living there? Okay, so they found out that the teacher took care of the remains but why? Satou's aunt told him to do it? The same aunt the teacher thought Satou had murdered? And why would Satou's aunt force him to do that? I'm pretty sure since the teacher knew about it, the other people at that school knew stuff about the situation with Satou's aunt. What?\n\nThere's so much that just doesn't add up but the authorities are just like \"this case is solved! The aunt did it! Fuck it!\"\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/DgInmsV.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/NI5d7j9.png)~~~\n\n~~I actually completely forgot she outright confessed.~~ \n\nWhat the fuck. Also, the actual ending for the characters is complete trash and it was the absolute worst possible ending I pictured in my head from as early as reading the first chapter of the manga.\n\n~!Haha, double suicide ending. Haha, Satou decided at the last second to save Shio by shielding her from the fall.!~\n\n~~This maybe is borderline a \"no fun allowed\" thing, but I'm pretty sure Shio would probably still die even if Satou tried to shield her. Like they jumped from the ROOF.~~\n\nBut oh no, while Shio survived the ordeal and finally got to be back with her brother, now she's fucked up and acting like Satou. Great!\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/gb2wWGA.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/4jlIhqI.png)~~~\n___\n\n#How This Could Have Been Good Horror#\n\nThis show actually kind of gave me the show I wanted. But infuriatingly, only in small doses, whereas it should have been the whole thing.\n\nI feel like this entire show would have worked way better if:\n\n1. Satou was actually treated as a full on antagonist.\n2. Shio does not side with Satou as she's a murdering and obsessed psychopath.\n\nLike the blueprints are in the actual series we received. Shio initially does not know what Satou is up to outside of the apartment. When Shio originally gets out of the apartment, Satou freaks out, and later puts in place outside locks to further prevent Shio from escaping. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/WwGAux4.png)\n\nThere's the whole process where Shio is going around when Satou is incapacitated from the trauma of killing her friend, and Shio finds Shouko's bloody clothes in the washing machine when she tries to do the laundry. \n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/7XwEiyk.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/uh17eex.png)~~~\n\nShio even full on rejects Satou at one point because Satou solely wants Shio just for her \"Happy Sugar Life\" and feels she's better off not knowing the truth.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/vhGyiDN.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/ABu61ad.png)~~~\n\nThe ideal version of this series in my eyes would have been Shio finding out the truth about Satou, Shio tries to escape Satou to make it to her brother whom she has forgotten as a result of all of the trauma she's faced as a result of the circumstances of her life. \n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/RYV1OTe.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/k7yGnAa.png)~~~\n\nIt could be an actual horror series as Satou could be pushed even further down the path of a psychopath because Shio would be running away from her.\n\nInstead...\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/bIzFvEJ.png)\n\n_\"Murder is perfectly okay, Satou!

Arc by Arc\n\n1)Hunter Exam.\nAlthough the beginning paints well and forms the friendship relations of which the main cast will be everything that consists of the examination itself is badly planned, to start all the characters do not seem to have empathic emotions with respect to everything that is happening in the same exam, nobody is unfazed or feels some fear corresponding to death, if I compare it with the whole cast that was raised and the situations in the Chunnin exam in Naruto this part HxH is too short, I could also talk about the end of the exam the hunter is hypocritical in the sense that they had raised this idea \"No matter what happens we will continue with the exam until the end\" but when they reach the tournament part in the end they complement it with \"You can not kill the opponent\" here everything goes relatively \"Good\" but when Killua kills the opponent they send everything to take for ass and approve the others in such a simple way, all the effort of the people who died to love complete the exam they sent him to take for ass for that detail.\n\n2) Tower of Heaven\nA whole arc where Killua and Gon go in search of skills, their premise is their problem, because it is basically that, a focused arc only to start making \"Complex\" the fights and make the show \"Deep\", the arc entirely dense, not passable or entertaining, simply dense and tedious, the fights of that arc are worth nothing because Gon and Killua are entirely protected by the plot armor of the moment so you know that they will not lose or die, therefore there is NO RISK, that means \"boring\". The arc is entirely bad\n\n3)York City\nDecerebrate action with a protagonist Gary stu to summarize things ... Kurapika skips the rules of the Nen that were established a back arc, you can increase the powers as he wants, He has unlimited access to the whole bar of powers of Nen, does not have any reflection after killing Uvogin because he had previously established that from his point of view everything he does is correct, Togashi fills Kurapika with unlimited weapons and powers after taking all one to create such a complex system of powers ... Shit\n\n4) Greed Island\nThe tower of heaven made worse; This arc is basically canon filler, you can skip it and it will not change anything, just take care to know that \"Gon and Killua train their powers in a world of video games\" because from then on the villain is the worst of the series in general , the bomber is forced into this arc only to create \"drama and tension\" .. All this arc is the worst shit\n\n5) Quimera ants\nVery good the arc entirely, the whole series was prepared for this moment and it is excellent, it has its criticable things as the Asspull of the nuclear bomb of Netero or that eliminated all the development of Meruem giving it \"Amnesia\" only to lengthen the arc still more in a more insufferable way ..\n\n6)The elections\nThe arc totally shits the consequences of the chimera ants (Revive Gon), the idea of \u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008bAlukka was not so bad since it had rules but AGAIN togashi loves to fuck his own rules and makes Killua know the only way to get the wishes WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES ... To end the arc with Gon looking for his father in the world tree, Gin tells him the message of the work in general \"That what matters is the trip, not the final destination\" the message would have meaning if Gon had learned something in his trip through the whole series, but you know what? GON NEVER LEARNS ANYTHING, IS THE SAME START TO THE END ... With this proposed you can imply that everything that happened the series is a nonsense that even in its last moments can unite its history with coherence to the message of the work\n\n\nIn conclusion..\nThe work is anticlimactic, it breaks all its proposed ideas, the protagonist never learns anything, the work is worth only in a single arc of 6 principals arcs, \nthe direction and the music make the anime mediocre even when the script entirely becomes bad."}, {"id": 3679, "score": 20, "body": "Put in a blender toilet jokes, protagonists whores and references to American franchises and gives you this fucked up\n\nHistory (2/10):\nThe series has absolutely nothing less than the starring Panty and Stocking, the entire stories of the series are one of two: 1) Parody to an American franchise. 2) P & S day stories making only sex jokes ... That's basically the whole series; The worst of the case is that the series instead of just \"reference\" finish, the entire frames of the chapters, the episodes have no difference, the original stories are only inserting a panty and stocking in it; When the series aspired to something better was when the demon sisters showed up making them look like some interesting antagonists but were relegated to a rocket team more.\n\nThe red humor of the series is horrible, it does not laugh unless it is a teenager who laughs with things like \"Shit, sex, sex, pee, shit, vomit, semen\" all his comedy stagnates in the first episode since they repeat the same routine of the joke throughout the series and never make it as fresh as in Ebichu\n\nCharacters (2/10)\nAll are also a piece of shit, Panty the only thing she does in the series is to be a whore and the series loves to repeat it over and over again in the face that she is a whore, Stocking is boring, Garterbell is even more forgettable if it were not Due to the fact that he is black, gay and masochistic, Chuck is tolerable between such a obnoxious cast, the diablas are the best of the series but it is potentially wasted and they are only longer in the series.\n\nArt (7/10)\nCreative and quite striking. What attracts of the series is its style of American cartoons turning it the style remaining identifiable and the best thing is periods of transformation when P & S change of cartoons to an animated style (SEXY); The series plays quite a lot with many styles of animation from the end when they kill their enemies by turning everything back to the mache paper mock up to 3D scenes, achieving less than the Imaishi direction in the series is the same as their other works based on more the dynamism and the camera movements at atmospheric level turning in periscope to better appreciate the scene\n\nSound (10/10).\nThe best of the series from afar, is music that can be used in a club and would be excellent, the soundtrack is a combination of sex with electro that while most of the film is innocent, the instrumental accompaniment with eccentric and moved rhythms.

Although, history follows the main events and is preparing things for the French revolution is when the problems begin more of the same manga, first presents characters that seem \"important\" to never show them again in the remainder of the manga (there are many examples but I will cite one specifically that would be \"the son of Damiens\"), the manga also love to present historical figures of that time every time but also return to the same to present them for a single moment in specific and never show them again in the remainder of this manga, do not close any plot-point in the whole manga just to leave it in the sequel, the last time skip in which the manga participates before finishing is the accumulation of all the problems that before indicated and more by the fact that the participation of Charles is relieved by giving camera to Maria Anttoinette that in itself not It's bad that but she's pretty boring when she has focus protagonist.\nFor the cake cherry the last 10 chapters are those that transform the manga a \"Clusterfuck\" presenting a character that in the 99 chapters we had never seen and tell us that it is the love of all life of Marie, shortly after appears to the next chapter everything that had been achieved is destroyed and end up killing to leave it in cliffhanger in the last chapter .. Pretty fucking shit\n\nCharacters (5/10)\nI mention it right here, the only character that is genuinely good is Charles, has a very good development since its inception with ideals of his youth hating the work of his family to the point of becoming like his father, all the moments in which he stars the scenes are the best thing that has to offer \"Innocent\" from then on is also Marie who is justified that is a shitty personality and her actions that take course in the story have meaning around breaking the stigma of her family, here the problem with Marie is that her character in the last time skip her personality reaches a maximum point of being annoying, when she was still a girl you can enjoy her participation in the protagonist focus but when she reaches adulthood she becomes the worst character in the manga, not I mention all the other characters because they have no relevance except Maria Antoniette but her appearance is until the last part of the manga, hence nobody else matters\n\nArt (10/10).\nI will not extend, I'll say it simple and concise, art is the best aspect of the manga and the author has an excellent use of panneling as well as his visual metaphors\n\nEnjoyment (7/10).\nEnjoyable and interesting experience, it is an entertaining manga although I would not recommend it and more because you have to swallow all the open plot points and the horrible ending to read the sequel that closes all\n\nOverall (4/10).\nIt is a manga that leaves everything for the next part without concluding anything and that the only good thing is its protagonist and the realistic setting"}, {"id": 3688, "score": 1, "body": "#This review is a FULL SPOILERS review.

I don't know who at their studio looked at this and decided it deserved to be animated, but they probably should be let go. Nonetheless, there's now no undoing their grievous mistake. Now and forever, Evil or Live has been added to the continuing sorrowful joke that is the horror genre. \n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/15MqGtd.png)\n \nWhereas I could probably argue that there is value to its fellow Fall 2017 brethren [Ousama Game](https://anilist.co/anime/99698/Kings-Game/), there is no redeeming qualities or value to Evil or Live. It is hands down probably one of the most pathetic pieces of shit I have ever watched.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/hFZRPsW.png)\n \nIt was almost so bad that it's worth watching just to behold the _masterful writing_. Like I cannot even wrap my head around it. It's not even like it's entertaining in a bad way it's just... it's just so fucking terrible that I had to see how it could possibly get worse. There are SOME funny bad moments, but I'd probably say the majority of the show is insufferably awful and misery inducing.\n \nWhich I guess you could argue was what they were going for. Since the entire show is teenagers getting their faces bashed in after getting launched into a fucking prison environment for using the computer.\n \n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/bRMgct3.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/WWBdEFp.png)~~~\n \n...And might I add, the fact that apparently __[INTERNET ADDICTION](https://www.verywellmind.com/internet-addiction-4157289)__ is a real thing and there are [real life facilities](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-40920488) for it, almost makes this series even more laughable. Was the point of the series to actually inform people about internet addiction? Was the point of the series to be about these facilities that were fucked up and corrupt? Or was the point about the story of this instructor and his relationship to his dominatrix or this power conflict between this purple hair guy and his fucking drug smuggling brother???\n \nIt's... it's just so fucking bad. I watched the first couple of episodes and just stopped for months. I thought it couldn't possibly get any worse and that it was just gonna be a show about buff muscular instructors making teenagers want to kill themselves or just outright beating them to death themselves.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/RXA7xQG.png)\n \nI mean if it was just stopped at that, it'd still be pretty fucking terrible but then there's all the other shit. As a matter of fact for this one, I don't think this is gonna be a very organized review. I have a lot of ground to cover.\n \n___\n \n#Hibiki, the fucking Worst Protagonist#\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/4GNC9cZ.png)\n \nThis fucking guy. I don't even have a list for absolute worst or most unlikable protagonists but if I DID, HIBIKI WOULD ABSOLUTELY BE IN THE TOP TEN. Like it's not just the fact that the shit writing present through the entire series doesn't know when he should be pathetic or the evil COOL guy but he's just...\n \nHe's just unlikable no matter what personality he's rolling with. When he's just like the new guy who's getting his shit kicked in or getting misled, he's laughable. When he's supposed to have snapped or hit his low point to force him to take action, he's completely fucking pathetic and irritating.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/q025VrQ.png)\n \nThere is actually an episode in this series where Hibiki's class has a fight off with one of the girl classes, and it's only Hibiki who can actually manage to stand up against the girl class. How does he best the strongest girl???\n \n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/1rJMUSM.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/cKQi1F7.png)~~~\n \n_Certainly the most enjoyable parts of this series is when Hibiki gets physically assaulted or called trash._\n \nHe immediately grabs one of her breasts to send her into a rage so she would use up all of his stamina and he could beat her. And then when one of the other guy classes come to challenge Hibiki's class right after?\n \n__Hibiki:__ \"Yo, this motherfucker who has all this fighting experience? It's unfair to make me fight him. Let's have a STAND OFF INSTEAD.\"\n \n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/zEaf0TR.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/JdAu3CP.png)~~~\n \nAnd then they just see who can stand longer for like three hours straight. No, really. This is actually what happens. This is actually a real thing that happens in this real series.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/8Afx6Fk.png)\n \n What was the ultimate purpose of it since it resulted in a goddamned draw? Well, Hibiki, being the genius he is, knew that the other guy would be pissed and come to try and force physical violence upon him. He sends his lackey off to bring him two buckets of water which he uses to cleverly disable the already exhausted thug, and then proceeds to send him to the fucking hospital by assaulting him but only when he literally is unable to fight back.\n \n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/Ftu5dXU.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/8B329TX.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/jj3HzOE.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/6ZUSFEv.png)~~~\n \n...It's fine, you CAN do a character like this. He's weak, he doesn't have the brawn so he has to rely on trickery and fighting like a scumbag, but... this is probably one of the most pathetic attempts to do \"that\" character I've ever seen. There are clear moments in the show where the show itself is trying to present him as this cool character but it's just...it's just fucking pathetic. ~~Before I end this review, I'm gonna count how many times I end up using the word \"pathetic\" in total.~~\n \nimg(https://i.imgur.com/jnjLSsq.png)\n \nThe show keeps forcing Hibiki and Shiori (the main female character) to interact with each other and like eventually Shiori not only calls him worthless but outright tells him to never come near her ever again and just one or two episodes after this, bam, they're in the same room again. Every single scene with them together was like _nails on a fucking chalkboard_.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/WSk9bdI.png)\n \nHibiki started off as a worthless pathetic whiny sack of shit. Then he hit a low point and started roaming around the school beating up others with a jacket full of bricks, but the show then decided that low point wasn't low enough so it smacked him back down to his pathetic state. But then, THEN, when he has to be in solitary confinement for two weeks, that's when he emerges and is the ___COOLEST MOTHERFUCKER WHO EVER LIVED___.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/afLCvtB.png)\n \nPunching and kicking other guy's genitals, fighting against girls, and sending people who can't even fight back to the hospital. Literally beating himself up when he's cornered and then dousing himself in _FUCKING KETCHUP_ to frame the other students... Hibiki's the coolest protagonist I've ever see--\n \n#PROJECTILE VOMITS#\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/MZypGF7.png)\n \n___\n \n#The Female Characters#\n \nOh jesus christ. There are four female characters that matter. Five if you count cell phone girl who gets disposed of or let out near the end of the series...? It was honestly kind of unclear and she doesn't matter so who cares. The ones that DO matter though are the trio girl students and the headmistress of the school.\n \nThe head mistress is... deeply intertwined with the deepest character of this show, so let's save her until we get there. So really let's just talk about the trio. ~~Or rather, just Shiori because the other two are basically joke characters.~~\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/YozrJbZ.png)\n \nYou have Shiori who is the girl that Hibiki knew from before they were sent to this hellhole. Shiori has an intense disgust for males due to the fact that oh just her uncle sexually abusing her and trying to blackmail her into being fine with it with the knowledge that he'll stop paying for her brother's hospital bills. Shiori is basically the punching bag of this series...?\n \n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/HkSn724.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/ZgjKy5g.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/IPLKJhJ.png)~~~\n \nThe series itself forces her and Hibiki to interact repeatedly, Hibiki outright causes her to endure having the rest of her class slap her one after the other, and the series ends with Shiori having been savagely beaten by the goon character (AND POSSIBLY __WORSE__ BUT THANK CHRIST IT'S ONLY IMPLIED). And Hibiki's final interaction with her that the show presents to us is Hibiki mocking and laughing at her. Sure he's pretending to do so and does ultimately help her escape but... ugh.\n \n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/PAh9VGU.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/nhZ0Z23.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/Powkw5K.png)~~~\n \nThe series just outright ends with her in the hospital. We do not get to see her actually finally make it to her brother. Hell, maybe her brother is just fucking dead. Why would her uncle continue to pay his hospital bills after sending Shiori to the internet addiction school INDEFINITELY.\n \n...Shiori's in the hospital fucked up, her brother's probably dead, but no we gotta see HIBIKI REUNITE WITH THE PURPLE HAIR GUY. BEST FRIENDS FOREVE--\n \n#PROJECTILE VOMITS#\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/UejqBAG.png)\n___\n \n#Shin, the... Disappointment?#\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/X5tIR0b.png)\n \nGod damn this motherfucker was almost just about as worthless as Hibiki. If you're gonna make a show about like internet addiction and these messed up facilities for it, why do you have to tack on this fucking halfhearted idiotic plot about...\n \nLike purple hair guy willingly entered this school to... get revenge on his brother who had his mother killed for some reason??? And Shin's brother was using this internet addiction school to... smuggle drugs for some reason??? And Shin's entire purpose in this series is he's gonna get this school shut down by having all the fucked up shit and the drug smuggling exposed to the public???\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/7AhpmZZ.png)\n \nThis plot felt so fucking tacked on and half heartedly done it kills me. He literally disappears almost entirely for the last couple of episodes until he sets part of the school on fire... and like the OP of the show shows him and Hibiki fist bumping like they're BEST FUCKING FRIENDS.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/4ZFoMKU.png)\n \nBut the entire series is Shin shitting on Hibiki and manipulating him and trying to force him to be his dog, trying to force him into sleeping with Shiori as well as taking naked pictures... and then when Hibiki refuses he just fucking immediately turns on him and Hibiki apparently after that wants revenge on Shin and that fucking goes nowhere. It literally goes nowhere because Hibiki apparently decides to run through flames so he can be with his friend Shin in his moment of triumph! Oh yeah by the way woah Shin was sick and/or dying the ENTIRE FUCKING SHOW what a surprise even though we're repeatedly shown him coughing.\n \n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/1552Np6.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/a2oK6Sd.png)~~~\n \n___Shin:___ _\"Fuck off if you're not going to be my dog and take naked pictures of the girl you like.\"_\n___Hibiki:___ _\"I'm going to get revenge on you, YOU ABSOLUTE PIECE OF SHIT.\"_\n \n_THEY'RE SUCH GOOD FRIENDS._\n \n...How can anyone describe this series as anything but miserable? So like what Hibiki and Shin just stood on the roof as the school burned down? I mean at least end the show with them fucking doing the fist bump in the OP if you're gonna insist on the fact that they're friends even though Hibiki clearly wanted reve--\n \n#PROJECTILE VOMITS#\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/ggAhQjY.png)\n \n___\n \n#The Head Instructor#\n \n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/sTbscoo.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/Z2DxlXj.png)~~~\n \nWell definitely, the hardest I laughed out of the entire series was when we were shown the Head Instructor's deeply tragic past before he joined the school's teaching staff. That's where the writing transcended bad and became _godlike_.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/1SrhkKg.png)\n \nHe's an ex-cop who betrayed his partner by cowardly allowing him to get shot to death in the middle of a narcotics bust while he was hiding away in a hole, then following his partner's death, he decides to try and meet up with his partner's family. His partner's wife is hospitalized and hates the Head Instructor for being the only person to survive. So he moves on to his partner's son, who now spends all his time in an internet parlor. The son blows up on him and calls his cop father a waste and failure of a father and then immediately dies from __INTERNET OVERDOSE__ and the Head Instructor witnesses it.\n \n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/cFVDdgC.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/bw7hg1u.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/NcxeRha.png)~~~\n \nEverybody else in the building is too focused in their own __INTERNET ACTIVITIES__ to even call for an ambulance. The __INTERNET__ has claimed yet another life this day. On a downward emotional spiral, the Head Instructor quits being a cop and goes to find his dead partner's lost daughter, only to find that she is acting as a DOMINATRIX, and he barges in on a session between her and her overweight partner.\n \n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/isB69n8.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/08DUTBL.png)~~~\n \nShe too calls her cop father a FAILURE and then proceeds to throw her overweight husband's heart medicine out of the room as he begins to have a heart attack due to the Head Instructor barging in. The Head Instructor fumbles and tries to get the heart medicine to him, but it is too late. He breaks down after witnessing yet another death, and begs the dominatrix daughter to punish him, and then the daughter proceeds to mention that the only thing the overweight man who just died who turned out to be married to her left her is the property of a failing schoo--\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/9lXD1NM.png)\n \n_Why._ Why is this in the show. We didn't need to see or know how the school got founded. We did not need to see this pathetic guy and his dominatrix's backstory to... we didn't need this. And it just comes out of fucking nowhere and it ends like it's just yet \"another thing\" that happened.\n \nWhat the FUCK was the POIN--\n \n#PROJECTILE VOMITS#\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/m7KTJfJ.png)\n \n___\n \n#The School/Facility#\n \nYeah. Yeah let's talk about this now.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/pa77jTv.png)\n \nThis school, this facility... it may as well as just be a fucking prison/military camp. But yet it is continually called a school. The students only ever do military training. I feel like a number of this series' problems would almost immediately disappear if you just did away with the internet addiction stuff and just outright called it and treated it as a prison rather than a school.\n \n~~Or rather an academy, I guess. It's basically a fucking prison.~~\n \nVery early on, the show basically presents the instructors as super harsh and super controlling. And true, many teenagers had their faces needlessly bashed and smashed in. Like sure go ahead, I give you permission to smash my son's face against like a concrete wall as long as you promise that when he comes home he won't overuse the internet.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/lbjwr9O.png)\n \nBut 90% of the time the instructors are almost nowhere to be seen as the various classes of students essentially go at war with each other. Hibiki is just running around at night smacking people with a jacket full of bricks at one point. Like all of the parents in this series are the fucking worst. Because an instructor or someone at one point just outright says something along the lines of:\n \n\"yeah sure students have died before, who CARES\"\n \n...And from the moment that line was spoken, I immediately just could not stop thinking about that gigantic plothole. Like the instructors say that the parents don't give two shits about what the instructors do to get the students to be rehabilitated from their internet using ways but...\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/ubkcHbV.png)\n \nI feel like if the students die, that's not gonna... be the case. I mean were they just gonna tell them that their child disappeared or ran away? Uh yeah, we kind of just lost them, sorry. I guess you're never gonna see them again ~~BECAUSE WE DISSOLVED THEIR CORPSE IN A TUB OF ACID.~~\n \nAnd like there is that moment very close to the end that the outside public actually are informed of the school and all the shit that's happening there and it feels like the big \"YEAH THESE FUCKED UP PLACES ARE REAL AND THEY'RE BAD AND THIS SERIES IS ABOUT THEM\" but after everything else that has happened it's just laughable and pathetic.\n \n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/WeXdyXY.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/ya6CdoR.png)~~~\n \nLike no fucking school or even a military school I'd bet would have a full on solitary confinement priso--\n \n#PROJECTILE VOMITS#\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/vTRQLnB.png)\n \n___\n \n#Conclusion#\n \n_Oh god._ I'm about to black out. I need to drink some water, I am SITTING in an ocean of vomit.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/WkYEfg5.png)\n \nWhat else even is there to fucking say about this series? I guess I didn't mention how it so strongly felt like the end was rushed? There was a bunch of stuff they showed like flashes of or didn't even include at all. Like when the students that escaped were shown on the outside in a hospital, I was just like...\n \n\"Oh... I guess they escaped through the sewer system they talked about...? Weird they... didn't show any of that. Thought escaping would have been a bigger deal but whatever...\"\n \nThen there was also all the stuff that we didn't get satisfactory closure on.\n \n- Shiori's brother. ~~Beyond the possible implication that he's just straight up fucking dead, I guess.~~\n- Hibiki's desire to get revenge on Shin.\n- The relationship between Hibiki and Shiori was fucking stupid, pointless, and not thought out well at all. Shiori probably appreciated Hibiki laughing at her sitting in a prison cell after possibly having been beaten and/or raped...? What even fucking happened there? I would pay money for someone to satisfactorily explain what happened between the scene where she's talking to Jun and her ending up in the prison cell and it NOT including possible rape by Jun's boyfriend/Shin's brother's goon. To fucking cry and reach out for Hibiki _OF ALL PEOPLE_, something fucking horrible must have happened to her. ~~But the more I think about it, I think the implication actually must be that her brother is just fucking dead.~~ Either way, just... how absolutely and completely shitty. Shiori actually is the literal punching bag of this entire series.\n- Even though he apparently mattered, Shin's brother never appeared a single time outside of flashbacks, but we're supposed to care about Shin getting revenge on him...?\n- Don't get to see the school actually get shut the fuck down.\n- Did Hibiki and Shin really just stay on the goddamned roof as the school burned down? Why would you end the series with them there, that's so fucking stupid.\n- What was with the fucking drug smuggling stuff, why would they ever also use this school to smuggle drugs in??? Shin's brother is an absolute idiot, apparently. Like no, this corrupt internet rehabilitation school is definitely the perfect way to smuggle drugs somehow\u00e2\u0080\u00a6?\n \nIt is just so fucking poorly thought out, terribly written, awful, miserable, pathetic, stupid, abhorrent. It should not exist in this world and yet it does and now we all have to deal with this fact (and I have to deal with the fact that I willingly ingested it) and...\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/sbaPd8a.png)\n \nI would have genuine problems trying to name a worse series. There's ones that have been more disappointing, ones that have made me angrier, but this one was just... something to behold. And unfortunately, it's another piece of trash that has been attached to the horror genre, on top of EVERYTHING ELSE.\n \nI give it a glorious __1 out of a 100__. Don't watch this unless you're purposely looking for something to injure yourself mentally. There are actually hundreds and hundreds of other shows out there. The only reason anyone should ever actually considering watching this show for is masochi\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n \n# [PROJECTILE VOMITS](https://www.inquisitr.com/4724906/evil-or-live-season-2-release-date-lixiang-jinqu-manga-manhua-anime-ending-episode-12/) #\n \n~~~img500(https://i.imgur.com/UyuMXde.png)~~~ ~~~img500(https://i.imgur.com/CwONLlV.png)~~~"}, {"id": 3691, "score": 45, "body": "#FULL SPOILERS AHEAD.

Ousama Game! It's a fucking joke! Horror anime? Garbage! ___GARBAGE!___\n \n...But not necessarily for the reasons you may be thinking. You can go ahead and close the review at this point if you wish. But for those who make the unfortunate decision to continue: let's begin the __autopsy!__\n \n___\n \n#Initial Conclusion#\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/4KwC3Lp.png)\n \nOusama Game is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I think you either hate it, love it, or love to laugh at it. Personally, I think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m definitely in the \u00e2\u0080\u009clove to laugh at it\u00e2\u0080\u009d camp. But there are several layers that you have to decipher or try and make sense of while you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching it.\n \n- __A)__ Is the studio animating this being serious?\n- __B)__ Was the original creator being serious?\n- __C)__ Were you supposed to find the deaths where people exploded into blood funny, and were you supposed to find the non-bloody deaths serious, emotional, and dramatic?\n \nSome of these questions I still don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know the answers to. Was this an insult to the horror genre as a whole? No. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the whole torture porn genre or the type of horror where whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a beast, human, entity, or monster, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something out to kill our entire cast of characters and we the viewer are there to either watch either everyone die or one or a few rise to the challenge and survive.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/QevU1JR.png)\n \nThe problem with Ousama Game isn't that it's edgy, that it's ridiculous, that it's fucking stupid, or that it goes too far. No, I think the problem is that not only is it not enough of any of these things, but it's just completely unfocused.\n \nHonestly, I get way more of the feeling that more than a few people behind this show knew exactly what they were making than its fellow [Fall 2017 horror brethren](https://anilist.co/anime/100226/EVIL-OR-LIVE/). So criticizing it from that angle seems way more appealing than an actual full serious breakdown of all of the terrible writing...\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/fMj03yF.png)\n \nI mean, it's teenagers getting messages on their cell phones telling them to do things or they'll die. You should almost immediately alter your expectations accordingly the moment the first teenager explodes into blood ~~or drop the show~~.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/23se21p.png)\n \n___\n \n#My Expectations vs Reality#\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/on0sl6y.png)\n \n...Yeah, it ended up being even worse than that. I'm glad that even back then one episode in I called it \"cheap trashy horror\" because that is definitely what Ousama Game is. But as I noted previously, it is _bad_ trash horror.\n \nWell right out of the gate, we are never shown a \"King.\" It is this weird omniscient but invisible force and there is no reasoning behind any of the commands it doles out to the students beyond the original creator going \"well this is what happens next.\" When there's no... no tangible and/or visible entity that is putting all these teenagers through hell, it's just... it's immediately lame.\n \n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/uS5aowj.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/72tmB9Y.png)~~~\n \nLike imagine the Friday the 13th movies if you just remove Jason Voorhees entirely. Rather than Jason himself wandering around murdering campers, it's just like an invisible floating machete that just kills people indiscriminately.\n \n~~...I'd totally watch a horror movie about a rampaging invisible machete, actually.~~\n \nIt's stupid. You gotta have a monster, you gotta have someone pulling the strings, you gotta have a TANGIBLE ENTITY. Which... Ousama Game itself basically admits and/or eventually realizes. Because while there is an antagonist through the whole show, they are essentially a fellow student who is being forced to play the Ousama Game. Still, the show literally ends after most of the other students are killed by disobeying the King with the actual antagonist just going around and directly causing other people's deaths...\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/HzvbdDg.png)\n \n...Eventually going so far to just pull out a random chainsaw. And it was at that moment where I (and I believe many others who watched this show) probably exclaimed _WHY THE FUCK WASN'T THIS THE ENTIRE SHOW._\n \nLike the end of the show or... maybe even that entire section of the show about the last command of the King was absolutely the best/most enjoyable part of the show. That was the sort of command I wanted the King to be giving out from the very start of the show.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/0UTHaiQ.png)\n \n\"Get to the summit of this mountain in this amount of time, the person farthest behind will die every so many hours.\"\n \nThat's weird and has the potential to be fun. You have the potential for just outright sabotage which of course eventually ends up happening, and you just have people dropping off from exhaustion. But instead, most of the commands the King gives are just...\n \n\"Have sex with this person. Why? Because I told you to. Do you want to explode in blood??? Then I guess you better do it.\"\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/yI3L1NB.png)\n \nI really wanted there to be a King. Like a student who is just fucking systematically pushing their classmates into the very depths of insanity just because they could. But it really is just basically whatever goes. There's absolutely  no structure or consistency to the commands, and while there are rules to the Ousama Game they are fucking shaky at best.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/ZRIYsEf.png)\n \nBut I'll of course get to that...\n \n___\n \n#A Genuinely Clever Move#\n \nThe thing is, in this anime, there are actually like four different Ousama Games. There's the one that's happening in the present which is its [own manga in itself](https://anilist.co/manga/77332/Ousama-Game-Shuukyoku/), there's [the one that the main male character went through](https://anilist.co/manga/54836/Ousama-Game/) which precedes the one that this is mainly adapting (publication-wise as well), there's the original game that was done before all of them via letters rather than cellphones which I guess got its [own spinoff manga](https://anilist.co/manga/85429/Kings-Game-Origin/) at some point when the second manga was still going and only ended a year before the anime aired, and finally I guess there's the fourth Ousama Game that the antagonist of the anime and the second manga went through which I guess the original writer can just write whenever he feels like making more money ([apparently it already exists in light novel form](http://ousama-game.wikia.com/wiki/King%27s_Game:_Visit)).\n \n~~...The actual original Ousama Game is in fact actually I guess a series of trashy cell phone novels? I actually did not know that until starting this review that the three different manga are all different people adapting this [guy's](https://anilist.co/staff/108945/Nobuaki-Kanazawa) trash.~~\n \n...So the question is, how do you even approach adapting this fucking mess? Do you start with the very first Ousama Game what with letters rather than cellphones? Or do you start with the first one that the main male character (which I guess either the original creator named after himself or he's using the main character's name as a pseudonym which if it's the latter, good on him because I wouldn't want to put my real name to this shit either) is in?\n \nWell, the correct answer is... ___just do it all.___ Just rip off that band-aid in one fucking movement.\n \n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/xVOb3Bm.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/fGXBDce.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/7QuMjZq.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/K5KYk4F.png)~~~\n \nThe main focus will of course be on adapting the Ousama Game with the subtitle that's literally just *EXTREME* but we'll also partially adapt some of the original Ousama Game that Nobuaki was in, with the various references of the other two Ousama Games left intact.\n \nThey could have totally just tried to do a full on adaptation of the original Ousama Game that seemed from what we saw of it, much more boring and actually apparently more about trying to find out who the fuck or what the fuck the King is. But thank Christ, they said \"nah, fuck that, let's just get to the chainsaw as soon as possible.\"\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/2xS1exz.png)\n \nLike the Nobuaki's past Ousama Game was apparently like five volumes long with twenty five chapters. The present Ousama Game is also five volumes long but with sixty chapters.\n \n...I have not read any of the Ousama Game manga, but I can already picture it in my head. It's probably a hell of a lot longer. Like by the end of the first episode of the anime, we're already into the Ousama Game. The manga probably has all of this preamble shit and actually like tries to build up or introduce the class and that is... I don't want that. Nobody wants that.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/JoWWxuf.png)\n \n...Granted, I guess the structure wouldn't be quite as fucked what with like the start of the present Ousama Game leading to a large section of flashbacks that show events of the original Ousama Game and then leading back into the present Ousama Game without actually showing the conclusion of the original Ousama Game until just about the end of the present Ousama Ga--\n \nLook, either we have to deal with a plot structure that's fucked up beyond recognition, or we have to deal with more Ousama Game being animated. The point is, I'm glad they actively chose to abbreviate it.\n \n...Also apparently, there's actually even more Ousama Games than I initially thought? Well, at least they focused on adapting the most over the top one. After all, how can you raise it any further past __EXTREME__??\n \nimg(https://i.imgur.com/VEvTDk7.png)\n \n~~Oh fuck off. Yeah sure, waste my time with the smaller fish when you could have animated the entire teenager populace of Japan literally exploding into blood.~~\n \n___\n \n#The Death Game Genre#\n \nWouldn't it be great if we could just... exile the entire death game genre out of the horror/psychological/thriller genres and into its own... thing?\n \nimg(https://i.imgur.com/xXCnl8L.png)\n \nIt should just very quickly be noted that I think I would have reacted much worse to the rest of Ousama Game if I hadn't read another death game series before I finally got back to Ousama Game. I won't spend much time on this, but like if you're reading this review and you watched Ousama Game and thought it was one of the absolute worst/insufferable things you've experienced, let me recommend you to your next challenge.\n \n[Ikenie Touhyou](https://anilist.co/manga/100164/Ikenie-Touhyou/). Imagine... imagine Ousama Game but without the gore. And to accompany the cell phone messages, there is this talking vindictive virtual mascot bee... thing?\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/RwdQLXY.png)\n \nIt... it genuinely made me look upon Ousama Game in a completely new light. I guess the entire point of this section of the review is to just point out the genre that Ousama Game crawled out of is a gigantic trash fire and there's genuine value in the statement:\n \n[\"There are worse things out there.\"](https://anilist.co/manga/101223/Tomogui-Kyoushitsu/)\n \n_I haven't even progressed into that one yet any further than the first chapter because I feel as if I'm still not mentally prepared. ~~And also, I don't like cannibalism.~~_\n \nAlso, I am not joking with this at all. The sole reason why I was even able to dust myself off and actually come back to finish Ousama Game after being like on episode three or four for ___MONTHS___ was because I read and suffered my way through this absolute gigantic piece of shit.\n \nSo of course I had to include a dedicated section for it in this review.\n \n_\"...at least Ousama Game wasn't THIS bad... maybe I'll try it again and then never ever touch a death game anything ever again!\"_\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/BZkk1SJ.png)\n___\n \n#How Ousama Game Really Dropped the Ball#\n \nBack to the main thread of this review...\n \nI think one of the most frustrating things about Ousama Game is almost everything around the antagonist. Like the main male protagonist, she has already survived another Ousama Game but unlike the protagonist, she has came to a very different conclusion about how one should proceed in the Ousama Game.\n \n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/D5evTwy.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/whw9bqR.png)~~~\n \nThe whole conflict between them is selflessness versus survival. Hope versus despair. One character will claim to be willing to do whatever is required to ensure she survives the Ousama Game. The other is willing to pay whatever price he needs to if it means ensuring the survival of the others around him. This could have genuinely interesting or entertaining, but the writing is just so fucking trash that the antagonist almost verbatim says something along the lines of \"Well, someone had to be the bad guy!\" towards the end of the show.\n \n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/hcZ11WT.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/mLuRcAw.png)~~~\n \nLike if the show had been more about the guy trying to desperately keep others alive despite already having the knowledge that only one person can survive an Ousama Game whereas the girl is just actively fucking sabotaging his efforts and outright killing people or causing their deaths? That would have been great!\n \nI mean why didn't Natsuko just fucking smash literally all of her friend's fingers in the finger game to send the rest of the class into chaos if she wanted to actively bring the Ousama Game to a quicker end? Like if the rules are so poorly fleshed out that you can just smash another person's fingers and psychologically dominate them into voting the way you want, you would think she would have used this to actually actively thin out the numbers. But literally nobody dies/gets punished in the finger game.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/hxhgtx1.png)\n \nWhich wouldn't be too big of a problem if it wasn't for the fact that shortly after the finger game, it's revealed that when Natsuko had the guy who started going on about his dream of being a stylist right before smashing his hand's phone, she blocked the King on that guy's phone. It's established earlier through the flashback episodes of the first Ousama Game manga that if you block the king, it causes you to get punished and therefore killed.\n \n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/iV6zeSk.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/FsZaXCq.png)~~~\n \n...That's probably one of the lamest things I've ever witnessed in a horror anything. She had an opportunity to cause chaos and very likely at least cause the death of one other person. She did not take it. Instead, she kills a guy by blocking a number...? That was when Natsuko immediately became a joke and then I realized why the fuck was the entire class just bending to her every whim?\n \n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/FSqUhst.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/f4AAAIr.png)~~~\n \nLike basically the only rules of Ousama Game are that you can't withdraw from it, you can't block the King, etc. Hell, the way the show ends basically demonstrates that OUTRIGHT MURDER is acceptable. Maybe... maybe take Natsuko's phone? Maybe restrain the actual insane person? Maybe realize she keeps saying that only one person can survive Ousama Game and she seems very keen on being that ONE PERSON NO MATTER WHAT SHE HAS TO DO?\n \n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/Cz3w4FT.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/CprGWsa.png)~~~\n \nFinally, when Natsuko is just running around the woods misdirecting other classmates to their deaths as they're trying to get the mountain or outright causing their deaths and when she brings a goddamned chainsaw into the situation... you're just left asking why didn't she do any of this sooner? There is actually absolutely nothing establishing that the \"mountain run\" command is going to be the last round of Ousama Game so did... Natsuko finally decide she had enough and it was time to wipe everyone else out?\n \n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/Le6N4qF.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/dKb2NuJ.png)~~~\n \n_Just using straight up fucking Looney Tunes tactics now._\n \nIt literally doesn't matter. Because time to actually give some kudos to the original creator, as he actually did the right thing and didn't shy away from having literally everyone end up dying. Unfortunately, it's kind of ruined by the fact that there are plenty of other Ousama Games...\n \n\"We found out the truth about the Ousama Game! It'll keep going on forever unless everyone who's played dies!\"\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/MzEH4CC.png)\n \nThen they have their little chainsaw battle at the end, and both the hopeful protagonist and the despair inducing antagonist die knowing that they're free from having to suffer this fate for the rest of their lives, and nobody else has to go through it because of them.\n \nBut nope! Can't just end it there! Gotta keep making Ousama Game! More and more! MORE AND MORE! OUSAMA GAME: ANNIHILATION. OUSAMA GAME: APOCALYPSE. OUSAMA GAME: GALAXY.\n \nI would pay money to see a sci-fi Ousama Game but like all the students are aliens. Just keep pushing it as far as you possibly can.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/AUAzq0q.png)\n \n___\n \n#The Actual Comedy of Ousama Game#\n \n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/nKLDQu3.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/kTWYNBL.png)~~~\n \nWhen I called Ousama Game unfocused, what I mean is that... there's like two different \"types\" of deaths utilized through the whole thing.\n \nOh and also worth noting, it becomes very blurred whether some deaths are just how these characters are actually about to just die on their own or actual punishments from the King because they still send out a message claiming that they're being punished.\n \n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/zz1uZLT.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/BFAjhLe.png)~~~\n \nOr... the punishment doesn't have to be death at all but those are so few in number that it may as well as just be Ousama Game itself deciding to just fuck with everybody.\n \n\"Haha! Time for the punishment! Hope the person who is getting punished didn't immediately kill themselves because the punishment for this one _ISN'T_ death!\n \n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/78NNhD5.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/cdrUPa6.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/QIVYfqf.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/mBj6r8t.png)~~~\n \nLike the ones that are supposed to be funny are the especially gory ones where characters just basically explode into blood.\n \nBut the true hilarious deaths are of course the ones that are treated as if like the intention behind them was to make you feel emotional for these characters who are dying. One of the deaths that caused me to laugh the hardest when two characters who we are very quickly shown that they love each other right before it happens, like their punishment is like death via heart attacks.\n \n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/lmcF2Pk.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/cd73Qye.png)~~~\n \nCompletely bloodless, shouldn't be funny whatsoever, but I was laughing hysterically as these two characters were like trying to drag each other to the other so they could hold hands as they died. ~~Reading that previous line word for word back to myself really... really paints myself in a bad light but I can't help that this trashy horror makes me laugh so much.~~\n \nAlso, that death is almost directly after when we're shown what like some of the other students in Ousama Game: Extreme are doing which just... it's a tonal nightmare. Like when it's doing that stupid emotional heart attack death, the series actively wants you to forget what series you're watching. Just a couple of scenes before that was THIS.\n \n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/7F9xGFn.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/LhaPAIG.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/BZHBI4q.png)~~~\n \nThe gory deaths are funny sure, but this series is way funnier whenever it tries to be serious.\n \n\"I know we're doing like a finger game thing or whatever, but I really need to cut the main protagonist's hair because I dream of being a professional stylist one day, and I plan on breaking my fingers in this finger game and I know that I cannot cut hair without this hand!\"\n \n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/6hpagtK.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/QYAQRWz.png)~~~\n \nIt's almost a parody. I know this shit is probably directly right from the source material, but I really think the people behind the anime knew.\n \n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/gUWsx8T.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/rMMGrYt.png)~~~\n \n___\n \n#Conclusion#\n \n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/OqcPH3Q.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/7Ryc7OQ.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/waaQuEi.png)~~~\n \n...I genuinely really don't think it's quite as bad as it's made out to be, honestly. The writing is trash, the source material is trash, when thinking of this in terms of like an actual serious horror it's a complete joke, but.\n \nIn terms of over the top, cheap, trash horror...?\n \n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/fpGbPEz.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/xfmcSXE.png)~~~\n \nWhile at the very start it was kind of miserable, I did end up laughing quite a lot at this. Like the gore and the deaths in [Another](https://anilist.co/anime/11111/Another/) are a billion times better, but the overall tone of that series is way more serious which is what primarily prevented me from enjoying it because I was taking Another seriously and then... it disappointed me with how it turned out.\n \nOusama Game is pretty much a joke from the very start as I've already stated. There was no taking it seriously. But the King being like a goddamned virus rather than one of the students...?\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/eMjK8Rp.png)\n \nUgh. Ousama Game, while disappointing, was some pretty funny trash. I do remember being a lot more miserable in the first couple of episodes than the rest of the series, though.\n \n...Possibly controversial, but I give it a __4.5 out of 10__ or __45 out of 100__. Again, it's trash, but I genuinely think as far as the anime goes, a bunch of it was intentional. Plus, it ends in a pretty gloriously trashy way what with that fucking chainsaw that I guess was just at the summit of the mountain waiting for them.\n \nIt's edgy, it's stupid, it's over the top... but if you're looking to watch something where the characters are there just to die... it fulfills that purpose! ~~Also, if we're being honest, that [other \"horror\" show](https://i.imgur.com/MZypGF7.png) that aired along with it in the same season is enormously worse than Ousama Game.

I found the anime interesting for these points and watched the second season to enjoy them again --except...\n\nThe second season, Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi, threw those qualities away. They changed the tone of the story, art, and animation of the anime from the first season. The tone of the first season was light and comedic which worked well with aspects of the story such as the protagonist's perverseness, the heroine's condescending nature, and the idea of a person being a familiar in a world where creatures are familiars. In the second season, the tone of the animation, art, and story are more thick and serious which work terribly with the anime's whole concept. The protagonist is annoying and no longer funny and the heroine is overly jealous and down right abusive.\n\nThe change in character is reset and they act the same way they did before the resolution of the conflict. Additionally, new plot devices were added that diluted the focus of the anime and previous almost Deus Ex Machina devices were humiliatingly weak this time around. Not to mention, when the characters previously had no problems about killing thousands of soldiers, they suddenly have a moral code for no killing without any kind of spark that would've lit such a moral code. What I mean by this is that; Spider-man's motivation for fighting crime is because of his conceited actions that caused Uncle Ben to get killed. --Zero no Tsukaima has nothing like that. Ultimately, the second season is riddled with plot holes that greatly weakens the immersion of an isekai anime.\n\nI have no problem with the studio deciding to pursue a different theme for the second season. However, to completely disregard the first season by breaking the rules it established for itself is completely unacceptable. If the studio wanted to make an anime about an abusive girlfriend who has family problems, they should've made a completely different anime, not disgrace the first season by only loosely following the previous season's plot."}, {"id": 3711, "score": 30, "body": "Short story:\nAbsolure trash, your typical second sort power fantasy, with typical abused beta MC, who got OP powers he didn't know of and now kicks asses of his opressors and gets all the waifus.\n\nLong story:\nThe skill he was born with, Gluttony, first thought of by our MC to be completely and utterly useless, since it only makes him hungry all the time.

You're having fun up to that point, afterwards it's just vomit and headache._~~~\n\nIn this metaphore, _fun up to that point_ refers to my experience with the Shaman King anime, which I had the pleasure to watch during my early years in elementary school. _Vomit and headache_ then, as you may have guessed, symbolizes the atrocious hell I went through in my desperate need for more Shaman King material, ultimately losing my absolute shit upon the dreadful realization that the foundations of my childhood were made of nothing but lies and garbage. \n\nTo put the matter simply, I am still not over the Shaman King fever, the manga sucks and I will now in the upcoming paragraphs explain why that is so. This rant could be extremely biased and the review also includes spoilers from both manga and the anime (as i must compare the two), so consider yourself warned. Let's dig in.\n___\n#__the premise?__\n#####i will not be explaining what the story is about as I presume those who read this far have such knowledge and if not, then what the f are you even doing here chief? \n\n~~~img500(https://data.whicdn.com/images/110849775/large.jpg)~~~\n\nBoth manga and the anime portray one essential theme - friendship. Also the Shaman Fights and saving the world or the concept of good and evil, but the absolutely necessary and basic structure keeping the whole narrative in place is _friendship_. The story of Yoh Asakura is build upon the bonds he creates throughout his journey, the main message being __one evil cannot stand a chance against a bunch of folks connected by the power of bromance.__ That is what makes Shaman King... well, Shaman King. And it's also what makes the anime so great and what Hiroyuki Takei, the mangaka, failed so miserably at.\n\nBasically, the anime follows the source material pretty honestly in the first half. Yoh meets a person, fights a little, has a bonding moment with them and ultimately they become pals. Quite literally every (and I mean every) single antagonist is destined to follow such path. And that's _fine_. We are talking about a kids show (and manga). The message here is actually pretty good - in everyone is a little bit of kindness, we shouldn't condemn our enemies straight away, don't be too quick to judge - that is the stuff we should teach children. When we spice the things up with a bit of _a murder is always wrong no matter the circumstances_ you get the perfect family friendly product for your offspring. \n\nThat is, if such messages correspond with the story's actual narrative and aren't just faeces of a pre-established concept that's being violated on every other occassion for no other reason than the shock value. \n\nI shall elaborate on that one.\n\nThe anime is unproblematic in this aspect. The power of friendship is the God's Testament. The fundamental laws of the Shaman King universe all originate in the Friendship. That's great. If two characters are announced to be friends, then they actually are friends. Amazing. Hiroyuki Takei begs to differ though.\nIn the manga, one of the worst fuck-ups in the history of fuck-ups is the absolute dissonance between the established friendships and the characters' behaviour. We are led to believe Yoh's mates are all ready to _die_ for eachother. They argue, they fight but should the situation call for it, they are all besties who would lie down their lives for the Friendship. And then the story decides that __if anyone dies, there's deus ex machina bringing them back from the dead every single time, thus completely disregarding death itself as it has no meaning anymore.__ \nSo, apart from the very obvious problems that come from this decision, there's one matter that disgusted me beyond any reasonable measure. Yoh's so-called friends are now well aware that if they kill someone, that person can be resurrected right away. So, they finally decide... _to kill Yoh_.\n\n~~~img500(https://i.imgur.com/y9DItLY.jpg)~~~\n\nThis attempt is interrupted, yet it is made absolutely clear that Yoh's crew members (there are exceceptions, mind you) were _set to murder Yoh because deep down they hate him_. It is abundantly transparent. Yoh is supposedly the strongest, from this famous shaman family, everyone loves him, he even has a pretty fianc\u00c3\u00a9, always the centre of the attention - of course everyone envies him, living in his shadow, reduced to nothing but pathetic sidekicks only to admire the great Yoh Asakura. And now they get the chance to take their anger out on him without any consequences. And Yoh's friends take this chance without second thoughts.\n\nA shift in the mood is a common thing in anime and manga though, so why does it not work here as well? Because there is no follow-up to this event and no resolution. We are simply shown that they just argue a bit because Yoh thought that _ripping of your friend's arms is not cool_ but Ren responded that they _grow back anyway so it, in fact, is cool_ and no one questions this ever again. \n\nThis embarassing example of favoritism breaks this whole manga. Hiroyuki Takei prioritizes cheap fabricated drama at the expense of literally the only functioning substance that holds this already crumbling story together. The soothing idealized world of True Friendship comes crashing down for the sake of a few action packed chapters. \n\nOutrageous as it is, not only does this turn of events shed light onto the true nature of the comradeship between the main heroes which ruthlessly decapitates your childhood shaman-loving self, it doesn't even follow through with this plot twist and instead leaves you staring onto the screen in disbelief. This gigantic fuck up has no meaning. The whole experience is ruined for _no reason_. __Fucking Nani__\n______\n#__why cannot the manga recover from this wound?__\nUpon introducing the death-doesn't-exist point, the suspense necessarily has to cease to exist, too. While the shounen genre itself is embodiment of artifically manufactured tension, Shaman King takes this to another level. Not only you don't have to worry about the protagonists since they never die in these types of manga and anime, now you can rest easy since _nobody_ is in danger anymore. \n\nThis literal spit in in the reader's face could be considered the worst decision the author could possibly ever make. But don't worry, it gets worse.\n\n~~~img500(https://i.imgur.com/81xCG5n.jpg)~~~\n\nSo, now everybody knows that death isn't any deal at all (being revived even makes the shaman stronger, so why not) and thanks to that the audience no longer fears for the characters. And yet... and yet the manga acts as if dying still meant something definitive. There are new and new situations in which someone goes \"if you die now, you are done for good\" REPEATEDLY and REPEATEDLY we are assured none of that bullshit is actually relevant because there's always a way to bring back the dead. \n\n~~~img500(https://i.imgur.com/Zj58n99.jpg)~~~\n~~~img500(https://i.imgur.com/3EnrxrU.jpg)~~~\n\nThese repetitive punches in the throat turned this enjoyable manga into the most frustrating and bewildering bags of nonsense I have ever laid my eyes upon. \n\nThat of course doesn't mean the plot was perfect prior to this pathetic twist. Shaman King has been flawed since the very first chapter. Nevermind the obvious plot holes in the world building itself, there have been numerous cases of characters disappearing mid-scene from the story suddenly only to reappear whenever the mangaka remembers their existence, overused tropes and plot devices or just plain idiocy, yet every single one of those imperfections could have been overlooked. None of mentioned above is crucial for manga of this sort. When visiting Shaman King, the reader craves comedy, thrilling action sequences and fun characters and the friendship that evolves between them. Sadly enough, Hiroyuki Takei masterfully fails at every important aspect that makes shounen manga great.\n______\n#__characters?__\nIt is undeniable fact that the characters and the way they interact is one of the best things this manga has to offer. Not only are they actually quite developed, we also get to see a number of antagonists and the neutrals, all in all the palette is especially colourful yet gets mudded along the way just as well.\n\nAnother one big hit to my poor childish heart was the chilling reveal that Manta or Amidamaru are side characters. As the story progresses, it decides to abandon in cold blood those we've known the longest, people who should in fact play a decisive role in Yoh's life and pushes them into the shadow to wait for when the plot needs them again. In their stead, dozens of new characters are being introduced for no apparent reason. The story itself doesn't actually need them nor is there enough screentime to eventually develop their personalities, their storylines add nothing to the main plot.\n\nWhat the manga does actually better than the anime adaptation (to a certain extent) is the portrayal of the main villain, Hao. In the anime, Zeke (alias Hao) is just some really powerful guy who wants shaman-only exclusive world and is extremely casual about it. Manga manages to humanize him. We get to see him vulnerable, emotional, fun, conflicted.\n\n~~~img500(https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/shamanking/images/e/ec/Hao%27s_followers.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080218194843&path-prefix=en)~~~\n\nHiroyuki goes, as per usual, too far in his attempts to make Hao likable and yet again contradicts everything that's been established only for the sake of a few laughs, leaving you quite dissatisfied with the fact that the antagonist, the guy who goes around murdering people, just stops on his walk to get in the hot springs with the heroes. And while they seem rather shocked, in the end they agree to chill with him anyway - despite all the previous efforts to set up just how much everyone involved hates Hao (there's even a dude whose parents were murdered by Hao and who dedicated his whole life to revenge them; yes, even he stayed in the bath, because funny?).\n\nAgain, there are no consequences to this bath scene, since everyone continues the next day about how they must eradicate Hao and his minions. _Nothing makes sense and nothing matters in the long run. People don't die when they get killed. I hate myself._\n_____\n#__why do I care?__\nShaman King is a bad written manga with so many bright ideas. The story proposes fun and interesting concepts. What it fails at is the execution.\nHonourable mention is for example the very ending of the story. Hao is so powerful that the heroes just straight up abort fighting against him, allowing Hao to become the Shaman King, ultimately attempting to kill him during his sleep at the crowning ceremony. Such a turn feels rather refreshing, especially considering that in the very end, it is actually the main villain who wins; it's the evil we've been struggling to defeat that becomes the King (and the next generation in the sequel Flowers actually gets to _fight for Hao as his team in an even bigger god-tier tournament_, like, that's fucking metal as shit). And yes, while even this twist is very problematic, at least it brings a fresh breeze into the genre.\n\nThere are couple more exceptionally good points, such as controversial justice holy league X-Laws, Hao's best friend Matamune, soul consuming terrifying spirit ally, Yoh and Hao teaming up against an even bigger threat (it made no sense but I like the idea), elaboration on Yoh's and Anna's relationship, etc.\n\nThe story of Shaman King is great. In the anime. It pulls off everything the manga couldn't and while I suppose the ending is more unique in the source material, the adaptation still manages to execute its own rather tradiotional concept in a much more elegant and satisfying way - the main hero with his spirit ally manage to defeat the evil but only with the help of everyone they met along the way. Also, the last battle in the Shaman King anime is objectively one of the best in the medium, in my opinion.\n_____\n#__list of what I particularly despised in the manga in comparison to the anime__ \n\nThe fact that Sharona and the girls never existed. Yeah. They are anime-only. And so is Ren's younger sister. Mindblowing, right? Also, Bailong has a wife and a kid. \n\n~~~img400(https://s3.narvii.com/image/a7hd5rgknzk662d3jlh2tfnsoalibzsl_hq.jpg)~~~\n\nManta, Amidamaru and Faust are just side characters. Side fucking characters with nearly no screentime.\nThe final Gigantic Amidamaru form never happens. Yoh and company don't use their spirit allies in the final battle _at all._\nSilva gets completely brainwashed by the Patch and no one even talks about it.\nThe Patch are all defending Hao in the end. \nYoh's supposed friends hate him.  \u00c2\u00af\\_(\u00e3\u0083\u0084)_/\u00c2\u00af\n______\n#__in conlusion__\nWould I recommend reading this manga? Absolutely. The first 180 chapters to be accurate. If you enjoy dumb shounens and fights and random power-ups, that is. Shaman King has it all - action, romance, bromance, actually nice and lovable protagonist and even a villain worth rooting for. And Shaman King fucks it all up, too.\n\nThis manga is extremely bad, yet enjoyable nontheless, for that reason i rate it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": 3717, "score": 20, "body": "I started watching this anime in spring of 2014. I had recently been injured and was, for most purposes, unable to use my arms. No video games. No drawing. Typing was possible but painful. I watched anime to keep myself from slipping into madness.\n\nSomehow, that made the now-infamous bait and switch betrayal of SAO a little more personal for me.\n\nFor the first arc of the story, I couldn't figure out why this anime had generated so much vitriol. It seemed fine. There are different kinds of quality. Sometimes you want an expensive cheesecake and sometimes you want a cookie out of the vending machine, and SAO looked like a perfectly acceptable cookie. I wasn't really paying much attention to anime during its run, so when I started watching it, I figured the harsh criticism I'd seen was just nerds doing what nerds do: being snobs about something kinda average that got really popular. Plus, Yuki Kajiura did the soundtrack, so even if it turned out to be garbage I'd probably be able to add another cool OST to my library.\n\nIt wasn't perfect, but it _was_ compelling, and genuinely fun. Like yeah, it's kinda corny, and Kirito sure seems to spend a lot of time solving problems for adorable cookie-cutter anime girls. But it's not TERRIBLE. Not for the first half. I especially liked the episode where they had to solve an ingame murder mystery where someone managed to kill another player without PVP enabled. Kirito and Asuna's relationship is pretty cute, and it's actually refreshing that they don't spend the entire anime beating around the bush about liking each other. I really wanted to see more of the other characters, too. I wanted to see them come up with strategies to escape. I wanted to learn more about who they are and what their lives were like outside the game. I wanted to see how the real world dealt with the crisis. I was really, genuinely curious about how it would all resolve. That's why I blazed through the first half in a day.\n\nThe next day, I bounded home from an early morning doctor appointment, excited to keep watching, and it greeted me by stabbing me in the back.\n\nWithout giving away too much: with something like 14 episodes to go, the source of tension suddenly changes from something kind of stupid but compelling into something that's just stupid. A formerly-competent female character is shoehorned into the role of a weepy damsel in distress. She is literally all-but-raped onscreen for cheap drama; there's even the implied threat of tentacle rape at some point, which is a pretty good indicator of exactly how far this thing sinks. It's so sleazy I'm kind of embarrassed to admit that I watched it, and I can never really look the same way at people who gush at me about how much they love it.\n\nIn case all of the attempted rape wasn't nauseating enough, there's another gross, weirdly incestuous subplot and gratuitous nudity involving a middle-school-age girl, because_ of course there is_. Meanwhile, absolutely nothing else of interest happens, since Kirito, who does not actually have a personality outside of being OMG SO COOL, cannot carry the story by himself, and none of the other elements of the second arc are as interesting as the unfinished story that preceded it. When it isn't being outright revolting, it's boring. Every episode in the second arc is a snorefest punctuated by moments of intense discomfort. Like the dentist. (Writing tip: if reading your story is in any way comparable to a dentist visit, start over.)\n\nFool that I was, I slogged through the second arc, hoping that it might redeem itself. But the story cuts itself short and runs off screaming in another direction, fleeing from everything that was working, as if it's afraid of its own success. It simply ceases to be compelling and never recovers.\n\nIn the end, SAO is an alluring premise tainted by unchecked horniness. In the first episode, it presents itself as a fantasy/action/adventure with the a bit of the high-stakes \"death game\" genre thrown in, a strong draw-- but it's a complete lie. Remove it from its flashy MMO backdrop, and it's just another male nerd power fantasy, more interested in its OMG SO COOL protagonist and squicky fetishes than it is in telling its own story, and that's why it fails so miserably, and why people who hate it do so with such a passion. There was a rock baked into our vending machine cookie.\n\nBafflingly, not only does the first season continue after the story stops-- it keeps getting new seasons, and spinoffs, and video games, even though everything that was interesting about it is already long since discarded. It's an entire franchise built on half of a foundation. It is a dead thing still walking; a wretched, half-formed soul that died in infancy and can never find rest.\n\nThe OST is still in my library.

I wanted to watch some anime, and at the time, I didn't want to get into anything that I had preconceptions about, or that seemed like a big commitment. So I clicked on the first unfamiliar thing I saw.\n\nIt opens strong. The first episode is actually really funny and intriguing. For about 20 minutes I thought maybe I'd stumbled into a hidden gem, but that's about as good as it gets. The farther it keeps going, the more it falls apart, like a bicycle with square wheels and a lot of loose screws.

It relies on a lot of contrived plot points and incredible coincidences to drive the story. \n\nIt looks like what happened here is that someone had a lot of ideas for scenes that they thought would be good, and no idea how to coherently string all of them together.

It doesn't leave time for a really punchy conclusion, so it just sort of fizzles out at the end, which is sad.\n\nI think the most unique feature of Charlotte is the depth of the gap between the quality of the actual writing and the execution is pretty big. That is to say, the execution is really good, and mostly everything else is garbage. It's like eating microwave pizza rolls at a black tie event.

After the waiting, the uncertainty, biblically-proportioned flood of 20th anniversary merchandise... this wasn't a case of hype killing an experience. Sailor Moon Crystal is an unmitigated disaster in almost every way imaginable.\n\nLet's address the biggest, pinkest elephant in the room from the start: the artwork. I think what happened here was an ambitious idea (trying to mimic Naoko Takeuchi's elaborate manga style in animation) with poor planning and sloppy execution. Visually speaking, they missed the mark. Right from the teaser, people rightfully pointed out that something was off. The first episode looks mostly fine-- not amazing, but ok-- and then it's like they gave up. Every TV anime has the occasional awkward shot, but Crystal's bad shots are so numerous and so bad that they're actively distracting. This is especially tragic because it's clear that this series could have been stunning. Seriously, go watch the Moon Pride music video and compare it to any scene in the anime. It could have all looked that good, if someone had cared.\n\nBut nobody cared.\n\nThings move, but the only thing that really gets loving animation is Sailor Moon's hair. Nobody's walk cycles look quite right, ever, and a lot of the time, no one seems grounded in the environments. A lot of \"animation\" is accomplished by having still images pan across the screen or stretch/shrink, to unintentional comedic effect. Fight scenes show a bit more effort than the classic anime's JRPG-style \"stock attack footage, villain reaction, rinse and repeat\" fights, but still seem to cut away at moments that would be inconvenient to animate.\n\nThe excuses for Crystal's moldy potato quality are thin. The old series was low-budget, rush-it-in-a-week animation from the 90's. The manga was yet unfinished, and they pumped out filler episodes to compensate. Physical, painted cels would have to be completely redone to correct any errors. By contrast, Sailor Moon Crystal episodes were produced in two weeks instead of one. The source material is complete. The animation is digital, which allows for much quicker and easier corrections. Technology has given us better, more efficient ways to animate in the last 20 years. Even a lot of the art \"fixes\" for the Blu-Ray are mediocre at best. I feel like a decade down the road we might hear horror stories about animating on Sailor Moon Crystal, like that they were paid in ketchup packets and forced to work 23-hour shifts and every misshapen face is a scream of protest.\n\nAlso, the CG henshin sequences use these weird, rubbery 3D models of the senshi that look like they belong in a cheap video game. They don't quite look like their 2D selves, their faces are creepy and doll-like, and transformations are just low-effort rehashes of the transformation scenes from the first anime. They aren't fun. It's just not fun to watch a crappy CG senshi twirl around like a plastic bag in a breeze with mediocre special effects. Sailor Moon's henshin sequences are an icon-- of the series, of the genre, and of anime in general. I'd wager almost anyone that saw Sailor Moon, even if it was ages ago and they haven't thought about it since they were a child, probably remembers the henshin sequences. You put effort and budget into something like that because your viewers are going to see it every episode. That Crystal fails to deliver, even here, is a clear indicator that nobody took any pride in this mess.\n\nUnfortunately, the story is as unsalvageable as the visuals. The 90's anime was notorious for its filler, but the filler is part of what endeared us all so much to its characters. Sailor Moon Crystal ran too far in the opposite direction, deciding to squeeze two story arcs into one 26-episode season. It's extremely condensed. The story itself is so excited to get to its next nostalgic plot destination and say, \"Look how we did it THIS time!\" that it forgets the journey, and the journey is the most important part. One manga chapter can not always equal one anime episode; that's just not how adaptation works. While it's true that the manga, which Crystal is heavily based on, is pretty fast-paced, the manga has a fairy-tale feel to it and still manages to be engaging and emotional though its much more expressive artwork. Meanwhile, most every character drawn in Crystal has the emotional depth and subtlety of an emoticon. \n\nCrystal takes no time to linger or to build its characters. Everyone but Usagi is a cardboard stand-up, pared down to their most basic traits. The inner senshi, after their introductions, are flattened so badly their dialogue becomes interchangeable, and by the climax of the first arc, they are _literally just finishing every sentence together_. It's like the writers wrote dialogue for one person and cut it up into little pieces so the poor things would all have lines, like a grade school play for a class with too many children. The senshi exist as little more than cheerleaders for Usagi, and any moments of  personal achievement they were given in the manga are handed off to Sailor Moon. (Forget about this series as an adaptation of the manga: it diverges, pointlessly, all the time. Anyone who says it's \"accurate to the manga\" didn't read the manga.)\n\nBecause Crystal makes its characters strangers to us, drama comes off as melodrama, and any moment meant to be meaningful or touching flops. It lacks any emotional truth; you have no reason to care about what's happening. It tries to spoon-feed you what you're supposed to feel about the characters and the story, but never actually goes out of its way to create those feelings. Humor is almost absent, and feels forced or out of place when it happens. Characters pass the idiot ball around, with plot threads hinging mostly on their cluelessness-- especially Usagi, who we are meant to adore, and who the senshi praise mindlessly at every turn, even though this incarnation of her is annoying, selfish, and pathetic.\n\nThat's really one of the worst parts; Sailor Moon herself is no longer a good role model or even a likeable character. The Sailor Moon I knew was a ditzy, clumsy, silly girl with a heart of gold and the capacity for infinite love and bravery, a person who lifted others up, drew them together, and still fought for them even when she was all alone. She started out childish and selfish, but she always came through for her friends and grew immensely over the course of the series. Crystal!Usagi is obsessed with Mamoru and frequently forgets about or outright ignores her friends while they get tossed around by their adversaries. The most she seems to be able to say about them is that they're beautiful. And while she's still an airheaded klutz, it's not cute or charming anymore, because she's so thoroughly exhausting. She doesn't seem to care about anything other than her own feelings and desires. She's just a witless, bratty child that never changes and never learns and gets exactly what she wants anyway. The senshi's unthinking devotion to her is downright eerie, like they've been brainwashed to worship her, because she is so obviously unworthy of their adoration. Even Rei, critical of Usagi and at first suspicious of the whole sailor senshi thing in every previous incarnation, doesn't seem to have a single doubt about Usagi as their leader. Sailor Moon Crystal successfully made me hate a character that I previously loved and would have defended until blue in the face. Sailor Moon is my least favorite character in an anime named after her.\n\nIncidentally: there is also a hackneyed, half-assed romance subplot involving all of the senshi, executed poorly of course because Crystal doesn't have the time or the dexterity to handle 8 not-Usagi characters' subplots. The theme song claims they don't need princes to save them, but the senshi are more dependent on men than they have ever been. I don't think Sailor Moon has ever been the perfect flawless feminist holy grail that some people make it out to be, but this version is a step backwards in comparison to the others. For a specific example, a panel with a consensual kiss between Usagi and Mamoru is converted into an animated scene where Mamoru forces a kiss on Usagi while she tries to push him away. _Miracle romance!_\n\nThe main plot itself is ass pull after ass pull after deus ex machina. Admittedly, this is a staple of Sailor Moon, but with a rushed story, cardboard characters, downright ugly animation and basically nothing likable or exciting to hold on to, it's kind of the final nail in the coffin. There's no charm left to save it. The story itself hasn't aged perfectly-- it needed some updating that just didn't happen. Imagine Crystal under a different name, and you get a shabby imitation of the classic anime and a weak contender in a genre that it revolutionized. And that's terrible.\n\nAlso, other than the catchy OP/ED, the music is forgettable. Having heard some of the other soundtracks Yasuharu Takanashi has worked on, it sounds phoned-in. The music never strongly ties itself to any scenes, even the transformation sequences. Most of my music collection is anime soundtracks, and I can't say I even remember most of Crystal's.\n\nI spent a lot of time being patient and forgiving with this series. I managed to convince myself I was enjoying it for about seven episodes. There are a select few good moments that have made me smile or laugh, but it's like picking chocolate chips out of a pile of gravel. It's not worth the effort. It makes me sad that this shallow, lifeless adaptation of the manga is how a lot of people are going to get introduced to Sailor Moon. The original manga story is a gem that could be easily polished, but again, _nobody cared._\n\nThis series was not given the respect or care that it deserved. Those two years of secrecy and delays were frustrating, but not nearly as frustrating as the result: a soulless, slapdash mess, a totally transparent cash grab (as clearly indicated by the ridiculous price gouging on the BDs). It's the anime equivalent of a cheap bath gift set-- presented like it's luxurious and classy, but it's just glorified hand soap. As a long-time Sailor Moon fan, it's hard for me to evaluate Crystal without comparing it to other incarnations, but as a reboot for such a popular, long-lived franchise, it's a massive letdown. Toei fed us some garbage to peddle merchandise.\n\nI gave up on Crystal for a while after the first arc. I ignored it until the third season. It does get better, but only marginally; nobody on the animation staff ever bothers to google \"what do cats look like,\" Usagi and Chibiusa's heads are still weirdly deformed all the time, and even the better-written scenes ring hollow, thanks to the shoddy foundation laid down by the early episodes. The best I can hope for at this point is that it will lead people to other, better versions of Sailor Moon.\n\nSometimes the things you loved were fine the way they were. I didn't spend my days longing for a new Sailor Moon anime before I knew it was happening. And now that it exists, I mostly wish it didn't. Maybe it's ok for good things to be over. Maybe I'm wiser now. Maybe I just spent $15 on a gashapon Cutie Moon Rod. Don't judge me."}, {"id": 3730, "score": 10, "body": ">**Note:** my scores refer to my personal enjoyment, which in this case was abysmal. In the review, however, I tried to explain if and why this anime is not worth your time.\n\nI went into this anime expecting to like it but, since the first episode, I understood that it wasn't my thing. I wanted to see it through the end but I decided to drop it after 6 episodes because I just couldn't stand it anymore. \n\nI'm a pretty frequent BL consumer, and someone who is absolutely not put off by \"problematic content\". I'm not squicked by rape or violence, and I am able to appreciate stories about those themes, even when they're not overtly condemned. This anime, however, is in a whole different league and I personally found it absolutely revolting. The whole double standard with rape being portrayed as just another thing that happens when a certain character does it but made appear as bad when it's another character doing it was the last drop in a bucket that had been brimming from the get-go.\n\nBut one thing at a time: why do I think this anime is so bad?\n\nI don't think I can explain everything I think in a single review since there are so many things I don't like in every single episode, but I'll try to synthesize my main points.  \n\n**Plot? I don't know her.**\n===\nWhat is this anime about? Hell if I know. \n\nThese two guys are actors and the main character, Takato Saijo, was #1 sexiest man on a magazine for five years until this rival, Junta Azumaya, came along and stole his #1 place, which is a huge deal for Takato for some fucking reason and that should have something to do with the plot to the point that it's what the title of the anime comes from, but it's actually just an excuse to give these two some vague sort of rivalry before they meet. They meet because they have to shoot a movie together. Junta likes Takato. They fuck. They keep fucking. _Except you never see a sex scene_.\n\nThat's it, that's the plot. And it could totally be ok, not all animes must have a complicated plot, if it wasn't for all the other problems the show has. One could say that a good part of said problems, especially the fact that nothing seems to be happening, is due to the fact that they took a hard BL with a plot completely centered on sex, and took the explicit sex out of the formula, then proceeded to turn it into a 12 episode anime. I agree that this is definitely part of the problem, because once you take the sex scenes out of it you're left with __a generic, predictable, and frankly rather uninspired, BL plot__. \n\nSo what I was faced with when I watched was four episodes of the two main characters acting or talking, Junta sexually harassing a blatantly unwilling Takato, a fade to black, then repeat. And the mindless way the sexual assault is handled, the way it's presented as a _joke_, especially in a certain episode, was, to me, absolutely disgusting. But I'll get there. The remaining two episodes I watched introduced a \"love rival\", as expected, and managed to get even more disgusting in their portrayal of sexual harassment, rape, and a blatantly abusive relationship.\n\n>In short, the plot of this anime was not just forgettable: I __hope__ I'll forget it.\n\n**Two-dimensional is a compliment**\n===\n\nAll the characters in this anime are victims of a tragic illness: _terrible writing_.\n\n- __Takato Saijo__, a veteran actor with 20 years of experience in the industry, is a man extremely focused on his career, also because he seems to have nothing _but_ his career, at least before meeting ~~his abuser~~ Azumaya. He pretends to be extremely kind and friendly but actually he's grumpy and shy. That must be why he has literally no meaningful relationship with anyone before Junta forcibly makes his way into his ~~bed~~ life, as far as the anime tells us. In the _first_ episode he ends up getting drunk with Azumaya, his \"rival\". Why, you may ask? How? We don't know. There's no explanation (just vague excuses) as to why someone like him would get seriously drunk in front of this guy he dislikes and barely knows, especially when he's repeatedly shown to be keen on hiding his vulnerable side. He is *that* BL character who always gets raped for some reason, and that's the only side of his supposed characterization he lives up to; the only times he has a vaguely realistic reaction to it, it's soon gone in favor of yet another harassment followed by a fade to black.\n\n- __Junta Azumaya__, on the other hand, is absolutely cryptic to me. He's a mystery. He is a young actor with 3 years of experience in the industry, and he really admires Takato (which somehow translates into wanting to fuck him). Everyone likes him and thinks he's an angel because he smiles and acts childishly, and despite everyone liking him, he, too, isn't shown to have anyone else meaningful to him, or just anyone who seems to know him well, let alone who knows his self behind his \"angelic\" mask. His only 'friend' seems to be a kouhai, but their relationship is purely utilitarian and superficial. In conclusion, Junta's ~~only~~ most relevant character trait is undoubtedly his blind and uncontrollable desire to have sex with Takato. Everything he does in the whole anime is molesting him, abusing him, raping him, manipulating him.\nWhat makes him so cryptic is the way he's presented as absolutely innocent while doing all of these things. I've had a very hard time reconciling the gentle, sweet, caring lover the anime seems to be portraying him as with his actual actions, which perfectly fit the definition of \"abusive as*hole\".\n\n- __Chihiro Ayagi__, ~!a new actor gaining recognition recently, who is shown right off the bat to owe his newfound fame to favors he does in the bedroom to the right women. He's the \"love rival\" which obviously means he's another guy who tries to rape Takato. I appreciated that at least his portrayal is consistent with his actions and it makes me laugh a bit how in the end, despite being a complete as*hole, he was much more of a decent person with Takato than Junta will ever be. Paradoxically, he's better \"inserted\" in the world around him, as he has more people with which he interacts, if compared to the two main characters who seem to be wandering this world in complete solitude except for each other.!~\n\n> In short, the characters have two-dimensional, cliched personalities that in no way defy their expected roles and whose portrayal is often not coherent with their acts.\n\n**Rape is love. Or is it?**\n===\n\nI know the portrayal of rape is a known issue of a lot of BL fiction. In my experience, I've read my share of BL mangas with different degrees of unsatisfying portrayals of the subject, but this one is the worse yet. It might be connected to the fact that actual 18+ scenes are completely absent, leading to much more focus on the lacking psychology of the characters and no possibilities to appreciate the fact that at least the sex scenes are hot. It might also be a fault with the manga, I haven't read it so I wouldn't know, but I think that with those sex scenes, I could have appreciated Dakaretai a bit more.\n\nI do not expect an excessively realistic portrayal of issues such as rape, sexual harassment on the workplace and so on from a BL but, from every piece of fiction I expect a **minimum of familiarity with basic human psychology**, which in my opinion is **dramatically lacking** in Dakaretai. All these issues are not just left unexplored, ignored, or excused; they're not only shown as romantic, which is something I tend to expect from a BL; in some instances, Takato openly and repeatedly says \"no\", he's shown as unwilling, and he even cries because of Junta's inappropriate touching, and these scenes are seen as funny, presented as a sort of gag. The comedic tone the anime takes on and the scenes it chooses to do so, especially in some episodes, made me very uncomfortable; I found the choice almost alienating.\n\nWhat made any kind of enjoyment and hope I had left finally leave my body and disappear in the nothingness where it should have been from the first ten minutes of the first episode, however, was when ~!the same actions that were shown as nothing serious or even a gag when Junta was the one doing them to Takato, suddenly become a big deal when it's the rival, Ayagi, who does them. Yes, rape is just another way to get the attention and eventually the heart of a person you like, but that's only if you're Junta; if you're Ayagi, attempted rape even excuses Junta blackmailing you as \"revenge\". It might sound strange, but the lack of consistency was what definitely did it for me and made me decide to drop this trainwreck of an anime.!~\n\n> In short, the way rape, harassment, and similar issues are handled is not only inconsistent with human psychology, but inconsistent with **itself**.\n\nObviously, **I do not recommend this anime**, despite wasting way more time than it deserved watching 6 episodes of it and then writing this endless review, that I hope will at least spare someone that shares my tastes from the experience of watching it. However, I do recommend listening to the opening, it's a good piece."}, {"id": 3733, "score": 40, "body": "(This review originally appeared [link on my blog](https://countzeroor.com/2018/11/11/anime-review-holmes-of-kyoto/))\n\nInvoking the name of Sherlock Holmes sets a lot of expectations for a series. It sets the expectations that your series is going to be a mystery series, where the way the mysteries will be solved will be through the detective using deductive reasoning and through keen powers of observation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and also that the detective will have an audience-perspective sidekick who is intelligent and perceptive, but not as much as the detective. Holmes of Kyoto is, occasionally, that. However, just as much of the time, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a relationship drama, and not necessarily a well-executed relationship drama.\n\nThe show follows Aoi Mashiro, a college student attending university in Kyoto in order to get away from her drama she ran into in her High School life. While in town, where she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trying to get one of her late grandfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s antiques appraised, at the antique store she goes to she ends up meeting the son of the owner \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Kyotaka Yagashira \u00e2\u0080\u0093 known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cHolmes\u00e2\u0080\u009d both based on the kanji that make up his name and for his keen powers of observation. After becoming intrigued with him, and him with her appreciation of antiques, Aoi ends up working at the shop part time as an apprentice appraiser as well.\n\nNow, when I read the premise of this series, it really caught my interest. I like mysteries, and one of my favorite mystery series (aside from Sherlock Holmes itself) is Johnathan Gash\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Lovejoy series. The Lovejoy series not only presents interesting mysteries based around the antique world but also gets into some interesting and educational commentary about caring for and appreciating antiques. I had hoped for something somewhat similar \u00e2\u0080\u0093 after all, when you get a manga or anime that prominently features a topic as a part of the plot (fermentation in Moyashimon, making anime in Shirobako or video games in New Game) then the work will end up going into a dive into that field, educating the viewer somewhat on the topic\n\nThis show gets into neither of those.  On the antique side, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go into the fine detail of antique appreciation and various works of art \u00e2\u0080\u0093 no close-ups on the pottery to show the fine detail that makes this work so appreciated beyond its age. We just see the works sitting on a table at a distance, and are told about them in a single line of dialog. Never showing and barely telling. On the mystery side, only a handful of real mysteries come up in the show, and only a couple of times do things get serious \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and one of those occasions on the last episode \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it does so through the threat of sexual assault on Aoi, which is tonally inconsistent with the rest of the work.\n\nWhile Kyotaka does get a Moriarty-esque rival, the forger Enshou, he only shows up for about 3-4 episodes over the course of the series, and the plot arc of their conflict is not concluded by the end of the series. Indeed, nothing is really concluded. Yes, mysteries are solved within the episode that they are introduced, but the other plots \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the burgeoning romance between Aoi and Kyotaka, the rivalry between Enshou and Kyotaka \u00e2\u0080\u0093 advance but never really reach a stopping place. Indeed, the romance between Aoi and Kyotaka reaches a point where Aoi has admitted to herself that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in love with Kyotaka, but doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t progress from there.\n\nHad the series received a second season, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d cut the show more slack for this ending. Indeed, if the novels the show was based on had some sort of English release, I could reasonably refer you to those to get some sort of progression to the story. However, none of those options are available. Consequently, unless at some point in the future the series gets a second season, or the novels are brought to the states, I recommend skipping it."}, {"id": 3759, "score": 6, "body": " I thought, before going in, that a movie with such a High reputation such as __Akira__ would be so much better than what I was presented with.

I understand that it was a film from the late 80\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, so I can understand to an extent, but the entire film was scrambled mess of poor visuals and disgusting character design, which immediately took serious points away from the movie as I really __really__ cannot stand hideous character design. The ending of this film was a tragic mess that was highly deplorable, and if I may, a cop out. It made no effort to reconcile any events that had just transpired, and the characters were so under developed and boring that they showed no emotion or understanding to anything. \n\nA basic run down of what I seen was\n-\tQuarter 1: literally the same thing over and over.

As an avid dub watcher, I loved hearing some familiar voices like Johnny Yong Bosch, Wendee Lee, and Steve Blum, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s such a shame to see them wasted on this shit-show. \nAttention to anyone planning on watching this: please don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.

Right in the midst of the confrontation against Cell, and knowing how their world is in danger thanks to his presence, Goku happily accepts Kaio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s petition to investigate and deal with a threat coming from the southern galaxy without even knowing how much time this is going to take him, and Vegeta, who only wanted to fight Cell as soon as possible to prove himself, receives an invitation of another saiyan survivor called Paragus not only to become the king of a restored saiyan empire in a new planet, but also to fight against the legendary super saiyan who, according to Paragus, is causing havoc in the aforementioned galaxy, represents a threat to the new empire and Vegeta is the only one who can defeat him. The saiyan prince, who always heard stories about him, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even ask him why he would represent that since he was supposedly one of theirs, and tempted by the possibility to restore the glory of his race, also accepts to leave the same as Goku, both completely forgetting about Cell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s imminent threat and whose name, despite this, was curiously never ever mentioned throughout the entirety of this movie, as if that threat had never existed in the first place.\n\nHow is the audience supposed to buy this? Was it really that hard to add just a tad of credibility by just dedicating a few lines of the script to this situation? Just a simple \u00e2\u0080\u009chey guys, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s make this quick, remember we have to go back to Earth soon to fight Cell!\u00e2\u0080\u009d? I know this lack of credibility and realism is present in many DBZ movies, but that is still no excuse. Anyway, once they arrive on the planet, they meet Broly, the son of Paragus and a very peculiar saiyan survivor characterized by a suspicious calmed and gentle personality (an uncommon trait for the saiyan race), but who in reality was hiding a monster inside that was going to cause a lot of troubles for the Z team. \n\nIt just boggles me how Broly can be one of most beloved and popular villains among the DB fans. He is totally uninteresting, even for DBZ movies standards, or more precisely, was made uninteresting in the way. He could have been an intriguing villain. As someone who was overthrown and sentenced to death by his own people -given the threat he represented to the King for being born with an enormous power he had never asked for-, condemned to wander through the galaxies living in inhospitable conditions and who was later mind-controlled by his own father who wanted to make use of his colossal strength for his selfish purposes, he had a lot of valid reasons to be angry inside, to seek for revenge, and the potential to become more than just your average forgettable DBZ movie villain who wanted to conquer the world or something\u00e2\u0080\u00a6was always there. But unfortunately, the movie failed to take advantage of this potential at all by presenting him at first as this enigmatic robotic dude who doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say anything, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do anything besides making these wacky angry facial expressions whenever he stares at Goku (in such a way that it feels almost as if he was programmed to do so) and by then turning him into a dull over-muscled beast with just 2 brain cells: one that he uses to destroy and kill everything in his path, and the other one to yell: \u00e2\u0080\u009cKakarott!\u00e2\u0080\u009d. And this was everything the movie did with his character, the famous Legendary Super Saiyan!   \n\nWe never get to know how he really feels or what he thinks about everything he has had to live, what his true motivations are, because he never speaks a single relevant line about himself; when he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the beast, his mind and behavior are under control (with a machine that the movie never even bothered to tell us how his father invented or how does it work, not even a single simple and quick explanation: it just does!) and when he becomes the beast, he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t (and maybe, he just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t) say anything about himself either, he just limits to yell: \u00e2\u0080\u009cKakarott!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, leaving everything to speculation and allowing for some people to believe that, given the few-friends face he put to Goku and the obsession he develops towards him, the reason of all his anger was as stupid as he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bear Goku crying all the time next to him when they were babies, when the case could have perfectly been that, for some reason, he was to him just the embodiment of all the suffering he had to go through. Things are, since the information provided was so little and confusing, we could never know, losing all the opportunities to make the audience feel anything for him. At the end of the day he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a completely shallow character, nothing else but a killing machine that likes destroying everything in his way pretty much like how Kid Buu was, except this time not even half charismatic and \u00e2\u0080\u009clovable\u00e2\u0080\u009d like he was.\n\nThe other aspects of the movie weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t better. First, no matter how uninteresting your villain is, you can always arrange some exciting action scenes, which also wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the case here. The confrontation (that takes half the movie) was incredibly tedious and flat, failing to create any tension or genuine excitement, so much that you just wanted the Z team to finish the job quickly to get back to Earth and resume their conflict with the much more interesting Cell. \n\nSpeaking about Cell, Goku\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complete carefree attitude like if he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to solve this situation as soon as possible because Dr. Gero\u00e2\u0080\u0099s creation was waiting for him, not giving weight to the threat, was not believable. Goku was never that dumb! (At least not in the Z era). Vegeta acting out-of-character, easily surrendering after noticing Broly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s superiority, and as the prideful warrior he always was, also didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make sense; that was never part of his personality. Gohan, who was supposedly as powerful as his father (or even more) by this time, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do much besides being passively part of the final solution and helping the alien race from the harsh labor conditions under which they had to work for Paragus, the same as Krilin and Trunks. And Roshi and Oolong, who had absolutely nothing to do here, were also included in the quest just for the sake of adding unnecessary comedy, which was terrible, unfunny and totally forced, doing no favor.\n\nFinally, the ending of the movie feels like\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009dwell, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s end this, whatever way, and let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s get out of here quickly\u00e2\u0080\u009d. After a tedious, over-stretched fight, we had a rushed conclusion with the climax literally happening in the last minute before credits start rolling and goodbye. \n\nArt and animation are pretty good, and in fact, better than the actual main series. But every single DBZ movie also does, so this is nothing particularly special here. Though I have to say I liked the greenish design of Broly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hair and aura, which highlighted his status as an advanced and superior super saiyan. The music included some of the main series tunes (at least in the Japanese version, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know the dubbed one) but somehow I feel it was just ok, it couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t emphasize the intrigue and the action enough as opposed to what the main series always did so well.\n\nTo sum up, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBroly: The Legendary Super Saiyan\u00e2\u0080\u009d, was just a total letdown. It promised to be one of the best but at the end became one of the most lackluster of all the old DBZ movies. To be fair, most of them are, but as one of the most relevant given its direct connection with the franchise\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most important storyline (the saiyan race), in this case the result should have been better. It missed the opportunity to leverage the legend of the Legendary Super Saiyan (forgive the redundancy) Vegeta was always talking about during the Frieza arc and was painfully boring, as opposed to the other two Broly based movies (\u00e2\u0080\u009cBroly: Second Coming\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cBio-Broly\u00e2\u0080\u009d) which at least were funnier to watch since they featured the naughty kids Goten and Trunks going in an adventure and were considerably more enjoyable. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll honestly never understand what the DB fans found so good and entertaining in this movie and in Broly, who to me was never anything else than an over-muscled, 2 brain-celled beast obsessed with Goku for God knows why reasons, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m really hoping the upcoming movie, this time canon, could do something more interesting with the character and his backstory.\n"}, {"id": 3769, "score": 30, "body": "I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand this show.\n\nNot to say that I cannot understand the appeal of this show at all or what it might have been trying to say. Rather, I have barely any grasp on how this series has turned out the way it has. Initially, this show was dubbed by publishing company Kadokawa Shotan as \u00e2\u0080\u0098Project D\u00e2\u0080\u0099, an original series centred around time travel. The premise is honestly nothing new as time travel appears a dime a dozen in many anime nowadays. However most of the excitement RErideD was receiving stemmed from the announced staff, specifically Takuya Satou the chief director of Steins;Gate, alongside acclaimed character designer Yoshitoshi Abe. These two are known for bringing their own unique style and unconventional aesthetic to many of their works, and while RErideD is certainly a perplexing show as one would expect, I do not mean that as a positive. Because if one were to watch this show with no knowledge of the crew behind it, neither person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name would come to mind as RErided appears more middling that any of their previous work suggests in practically every way.\n\nRErideD is set in the near future where artificial intelligence has recently brought forth advancements in society\u00e2\u0080\u0099s living standards. Derrida, one of the engineers behind their creation has discovered a flaw in their programming that his co-worker says could prove fatal if not addressed quickly. After being ignored and reluctantly putting off any further action until later, they are attacked by his own company that results in Derrida being frozen for 10 years, emerging in a world devastated by the technology he helped create. On top of this, the update needed to repair the robots was given to his co-worker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter Mage who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now missing, leading Derrida on a quest to find her and the device before all hope is lost. \n\nNow, whatever hopes you have for this series based from my general description of the synopsis I want you to cast as far from your mind as possible, because the potential this story had gets crapped on and then some. The entire progression of this narrative is constantly dependent of contrivances, to the point where it no longer seems like a show you can trust on its internal logic to hold up. Time travel stories are often some of the most prone to these plot devices, but the fact that this series manages to fall back on the power of convenience so often without even having involved the concept of time travel for majority of the show is frustrating to say the least. Even the plot progression through Episode 1 just to reach the premise circumstances alone should give enough red flags to warrant concern:\n\n1. Derrida decides to leave the upgrade that would end up saving the world to his friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 8-year old daughter despite standing just outside of their house. Why? To move the story forward. \n1. When Derrida is attacked by his assailants, they shoot at their car till it explodes instead of just shooting at the guy. Why? To keep the story moving. \n1. After stumbling into an underground laboratory, Derrida manages to lock himself inside a cryostasis chamber so that 10 years pass by without him knowing. Do I even need to ask why?\n\nThe series only continues with this train of thought while, ironically, lacking such. Now awoken to a war-torn environment he meets Vidaux and Mayuka who offer to help him under the pretence that he will pay for their services. However, the pair soon find out that Derrida is promising their pay based on finding the upgrade he gave to Mage 10 years prior. Derrida does not have anything concrete to offer which makes their choice in continuing to help very odd and frankly unrealistic considering how the world has gone to shambles and helping Derrida this way would most likely result in the party wasting resources and money of their own. On top of that, Vidaux is constantly putting his daughter further in danger from protecting Derrida from everyone wanting to kill him. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choices like this that go against the setting and character motivations depicted, and even when/if an explanation is brought to light episodes later, more often than not we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re provided more questions than answers, a cardinal fault of the series. There are many examples throughout the show that similarly plague the plot, even sometimes going as far as breaking the laws of physics; from a character dodging every bullet her way in real time to a grenade going off in the same room as a little girl, only for her to come out of it hanging from the window with no injuries. If you were hoping for a serious, grounded series in RErideD then I think you might have put misguided trust in the wrong show.\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of remarkable for how many questionable choices and events take place in RErideD, at the end of the day it all comes across uneventful and as if you could care less about what ends up happening to the characters. Part of this falls back on the cast who all fail to properly leave an impact on the viewer. Fact: apart from Derrida I had to check MAL for what the character names were. Of course, the main character has purpose pushed onto him thanks to the plot, but is there anything else we really know about Derrida? Perhaps more importantly, is there anything particularly memorable about Derrida? Most of the other characters also lack in personality and depth, some even acting as a burden to where I was contemplating what purpose do these characters serve if they are constantly shown. The antagonists were also lacking in these aspects also, with the main villain appearing more like a poor man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s caricature of Donald Trump than anyone remotely interesting. There were obviously glimmers of hope throughout, like the hired assassin who appeared to have intriguing motives behind her actions, until her backstory was revealed just before she no longer served any purpose to the story. Revealing important aspects of characterization in the narrative whenever convenient is a very common theme with this series.\n\nRErideD is a hard show to pin down when trying to understand what it wants to be. Looking at the genres it belongs to: action, sci-fi, drama. And yet, RErideD constantly diverges from each of these categories assigned to it. Is there action present in this anime? Yes. But those scenes are few and far between the countless amount of exposition and dialogue viewers are subjected to that make the series less and less enjoyable. One would also think the action scenes would at least deliver for the 1 minute each episode they are shown. Shockingly these are the moments where the series is at its worst visually; poor CGI, significant drop in frame-rate, awkward character physics resulting in laughably dull moments. Yes, \u00e2\u0080\u009claughably dull\u00e2\u0080\u009d. RErideD tries to come off as a serious science fiction anime, yet the way time travel is executed makes the series feel more supernatural \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m no scientist, but I would imagine it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s extremely difficult to explain how an astral projection can help Derrida to time-leap by \u00e2\u0080\u0098thinking really hard about an intensive memory.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 The fact that time travel for most of the series had turned out inconsequential is also confounding to say the least. All that is left is a drama, one that leaves much to be desired on the emotion end as it regularly treads across separate genres, failing to establish a distinct identity for itself. Well, aside from being a bloated mess of an anime.\n\nDisappointment is the best word I would use to describe this show, most notably regarding its production. Never is the series able to alleviate the overall visual blandness of RErideD; never outright ugly or repulsive, just simply mediocre, run-of-the-mill art design lacking any visual flare. A muddy, insipid colour palette that does little to garner one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention, and typical uninspiring character designs that even look off-model in several stills. The art is plain, flavourless and comparing it to the almost avant-garde styles of their past work, feel like an antithesis to the aesthetics of Takuya Satou and Yoshitoshi Abe. I have to question the budget that went into RErideD, seeing as the action present here looks significantly worse than the typical exposition scene. The score is also unimpressive, merely passable OSTs and voice acting that leaves a lot to be desired. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s honestly a shame that as I stated before: RErideD is an original work that turned out middling in practically every way. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even say I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m mad or frustrated at it, just disappointment.\n\nAnd so, what we are left with is a series that disappoints from the very start and never rises anywhere close to the expectations seasoned anime fans hoped to see from it. It lacked logic, coherence and any convincing characters to be excited for after the first couple episodes. If you weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t left scratching your head in confusion at first, you were probably already busy rolling your eyes at the sheer number of illogical happenings unfolding in front of you. Maybe this could have been good. Maybe if there were a few significant changes made at the start, maybe a better script behind it, maybe a clearer vision of what RErideD should have been. Unfortunately, despite what the show would like to believe, time-leaps aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t possible in this world line. And even if they were, I highly doubt anyone would waste 10 years in a cryostasis chamber to do it.\n"}, {"id": 3775, "score": 41, "body": "\u00e2\u0080\u009cBloodivores\u00e2\u0080\u009d is an indication full of various philosophies in it. It makes you ask what really happened to this world? When criminals are toyed with, they really aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like that. Staying together is the only way but there is one person who prefers to play outside the rules. Not making everything work, it makes you ask for an intermediary between separate time spaces of reality and unreal. But, one philosophy question that always makes me curious until this day: how bad this anime? Yeah, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBloodivores\u00e2\u0080\u009d is another piece of arse with beautiful work from the animation, characters, even the small details are noticed. The landscape, the story, the background, all of them. With a nice concept that is even more than a typical survival game, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBloodivores\u00e2\u0080\u009d loses its potential. To be honest, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like that because the show literally combines other unique elements such as apocalyptic, fantasy, supernatural, vampire, but all of those cliches never included in it so that it produces something worse than the standard. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just enough to say at least \u00e2\u0080\u009cBloodivores\u00e2\u0080\u009d went accurately on our nuts.\n\nIt starts with one of the most stupid things I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever heard. Seriously, the show was initially introduced with four characters who were responsible for a robbery but were unsuccessful because it was said that one of them was \u00e2\u0080\u0098conspiring\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and suspicious of each other. Is Quentin Tarantino really proud of that because it seems familiar with \u00e2\u0080\u009cReservoir Dogs\u00e2\u0080\u009d I think? Anyway, the story isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much to say. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a generic show with your typical survival game and a lot of stuff going out of controlled. A main generic character, a big tits heroine with useless roles, a character who switches sides, a crybaby character, a cute annoying character, and things you can say in various other generic anime. The problem is, the show doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try to tell the most important information from the plot itself. Wait, there is no plot at all. There are many theories in this anime that allow the impression not to be ambiguous and cannot be interpreted for people. One important thing included in this anime is an example of a deus-ex machina which appears twice without any cause, stupid rules of the collars used by all criminals, the main character has a lot of explanations such as an abandoned city but doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show a really clear process, and any other trash you can spit out. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBloodivores\u00e2\u0080\u009d ends with a historical record that was never completed. If you want to make various theories without taking material from the original adaptation of the comic, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better not to. Just read the original comic if you want.\n\nThe art, especially the scenery, generally looks good so this part leaves an impression of a high-quality anime. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like a turd with a bit of salt on it. Its impressions are almost similar to \u00e2\u0080\u009cHand Shakers\u00e2\u0080\u009d which are probably one of the greatest, magnum opus, masterpiece, underrated gems I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever watched. Not appropriate, it kinds of similar to that. There are some parts like the frame that just shut up when one of the characters speaks but there is no movement from their mouth at all. It really reminds me of \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy Sister, My Writer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d one of this season anime which is the most criticized for its messed up art. Sadly, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how to explain it. Some action scenes are not possible if some of the size body of the character is always over-exaggerated. If you can look close or pause a few seconds from the frame you really noticed, you will get it if you can. In fact, the action scene is really weak and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel like a real action. The scene when one character loses a lot of blood, the blood completely disappears at the next cut and frame but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to notice if you only really want to find \u00e2\u0080\u0098something\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in this anime. The soundtrack is decent and I think, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wanna talk much for this aspect. There is nothing interesting at all, both the voice acting which kind of pretty good in some parts, the opening and ending theme song seems forgettable and repetitive. Just get out of here!\n\nWhen a slice of life anime that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t too concerned with the main plot is considered as a masterpiece, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBloodivores\u00e2\u0080\u009d could make you cornered to have witnessed something so gloomy. The characters just seem repetitive, forgettable, generic, and pointless. There is nothing possible if one of the characters in this anime takes the right decision so that the story will have a great impact. The main character, Mi Liu, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any motives and drivers. There are no triggers at all why, why, and why. They are like people who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deserve to fill stories, adapt to minor characters. As if they want to be created it as cool as any other main character, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just out of the box. They are trying so hard, want to impress emotional but the same as this anime too; it just came and went. Anju is just\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to say it. Useless with her big tits operation but what about \u00e2\u0080\u009cOccultic;Nine\u00e2\u0080\u009d which is probably one of my favorite seasons not because of the fanservice but I just like the story which is quite complex. In a nutshell, what a typical crybaby character. It sums up the whole thing in the final episode for no apparent reason capable of taking an important role. Lee Shin is pretty good instead of the main character but I just wonder why the character is afraid of women. The trash remnants from the rest of the characters aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t too useful to be given a little shout out. There is no development at all, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t explain clear reasons of why, what, where, when, who, and how.\n\nOne thing that surprised me from this \u00e2\u0080\u009cBloodivores\u00e2\u0080\u009d is that: what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the point you show the last episode\u00e2\u0080\u0099s summary part for the upcoming episode. Yeah, even though it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only 12 episodes but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no any reason they show the summary for episodes that come after the twelfth episode. Are there episodes missing? No one knows. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so frustrating, but at least there are so many \u00e2\u0080\u0098things\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that can be said of this anime. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s solid with the initial impression that it has potential, no character development whatsoever, bad art style, decent soundtrack, and a lot of theory with possibilities which have nothing to do with the plot. In short, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBloodivores\u00e2\u0080\u009d came and went forever."}, {"id": 3776, "score": 20, "body": "I think there would be very few that would argue that this is the mecha low of the year, basically a historical mecha series with humour and some political overtones. Hell, it even had Dai Sato on board with the production. If you don't know who he is, he is nothing short of a legend within the industry who composed the series, Eureka 7 but famous for his brilliant script writing in series such as Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex series and Wolf's Rain. You'd think that he would have an influence with the script and Fuuun Ishin Dai Shogun really started to look promising and then the first episode aired which destroyed every hope this series had, one by one with its abominable writing.\n\nThe storyline starts to chase its own tail, at its core it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trying to be one about Keiichiro Tokugawa who is our hero coming to terms with his great destiny and birth rite to take control of and save Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0094which is under threat not only from outside but from within. Somewhere amongst this is the story of the divine Onigami mecha, god-like machines able to be piloted only by those of pure body but are hunted by all those who want to use their great power. The story loses its way time and time again in favour of erotic fan service to try to develop Keiichiro to varying degrees of success.\n\nKeiichiro is more of a less impressive man and a bit too normal to match the likes of larger than life figure, Nobunaga. He speaks a big game but can barely back it up, easily gets beaten and thrown around by everyone. While he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always chasing after skirts he comes across as immature and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really grow up at all even as the show continues to pound away at his romance with Kiriko Hattori\u00e2\u0080\u0094who comes into the show as a big badass ninja sent to help Keiichiro but as she gets to know him and falls for him, she becomes less and less useful and more of a damsel in distress as the show progresses. He then develops a little Harem where the other heroines are introduced. Chiharu is the spunky token flat chest. Hyougo is the self-proclaimed warrior of the group who never a fight. Last is a friend of Keiichiro, Hyakusuke who follows him in his misadventures.\n\nDid J.C Staff and A.C.G.T go broke? Because the animation in Fuuun Ishin Dai Shogun is an embarrassment. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disastrous stop motion with bad lip sync and I have no idea how they managed to get away with it. It really is an upsetting factor considering the designs of the characters, Kurofune and the mecha are pretty good. Some of the designs of the different versions of the Onigami mecha were impressive but the animation was far too distracting to have an appreciation. If you guys love fanservice then you are in for a treat because the visuals are definitely its strong suit with the majority of the cast being girls with big tits. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sad that both Opening and Ending have better animation in them than the actual show itself.\n\nFuuun Ishin Dai Shogun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s score is forgettable except for one which normally played when Keiichiro pilot's the \"Susano'o\" which complimented the action sequences. The Opening song, \"Damashii Rises\" by Kyoco is a song that can grab your attention. The Ending song, \"Upon a Star\" by Saeko Zougou is a light and peaceful song that really doesn't fit any theme within the series. The Voice acting department got the job done but they were very limited due to the poor script. \n\nIt's a shame seeing potential go to waste. I hope that this series doesn't serve as an example for studios to put out poorly animated productions for quick cash. The amount of time dedicated to fanservice is extremely high to the point where you forget Keiichiro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goals and plot. Poorly executed in all areas and it feels like they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even try to make sense of anything. Frankly, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to believe Satou Dai wrote this at all, but his name is clearly on the credits. Fuuun Ishin Dai Shogun gives a list of ingredients, which are the following; horrible animation, sheer stupidity, lame sex comedy and almost impressive terribleness which has given the industry the perfect recipe on how a show can win the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Worst Anime of the Year\u00e2\u0080\u0099 award."}, {"id": 3790, "score": 35, "body": "If someone makes you a beautiful cake and you want to have it to keep looking at the decoration then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to wait to eat it.

Do you like a messed-up love polygon? Scum's Wish follows Hanabi Yasuraoka, a high schooler who is in love with her teacher and childhood friend, Narumi Kanai. However, when the object of her affection begins to show interest in another woman, Akane Minagawa, Hanabi makes a deal with her classmate, Mugi Awaya (who is in love with Akane), that they dull each other's loneliness and pain. By platonically sating each other's desires and substituting those who they wish to be with using the other, Mugi and Hanabi hope to stave off their sadness and one day be with the ones they love. This is their \"scum's wish.\" Both Hanabi and Mugi have girls that have unrequited love for them in Sanae Ebato and Noriko Komomebata. They come across as characters meant to distract you from the shallowness of the main threads. It turns into this twisted eye-rolling orgy fest where each one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s love isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reciprocated and they all use each other, most times in the most nonsensical of ways.\n\nThe plot itself is just messy. On its own, the various arcs could make for good stories, but because each arc is meant to fit into the grander story that the show is telling, the majority of it feels forced. Scum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Wish has this melodramatic and hyper-serious tone for the most part that makes the experience exhausting and hard to sit through an episode, and then, it randomly throws out these small segments of comedic relief, sometimes after a \"serious\" moment. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very bizarre and confusing, not because they clash with the oppressively melodramatic tone, but because the transitions in between are so quick that they amount to nothing meaningful\u00e2\u0080\u0094something similar to how Akame ga Kill would go from a brutal, dark scene and quickly cut in and out with these clich\u00c3\u00a9 comedic scenes, which comes back to what I stated earlier, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrying to have its cake and eat it too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to care about any of the characters when there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just nothing going on with them whatsoever outside of their sexual desires. They have the personalities and charisma to that of a brick wall. When they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not moping around over relationship drama, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re literally just sitting around, bored, and this is where the endless internal monologuing becomes unbearably painful.\n\nThe characters bore you to death with their dialogue that everything else about the show becomes so nauseating and obnoxious. They all exist in a metaphorical box where they're forced to play the role the plot has laid out for them, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re given little room to grow and can only hope to break out of their small, melodramatic shackles. This series lacks emotional depth but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presented in a pretentious way like its intentions are smutty, but it wants you to see them as fearless and important. Cheating, illicit relationships with teachers and students, a lesbian who has a cousin that is in love with her\u00e2\u0080\u0094these taboos are crossed not because the show has something interesting to say about these kinds of relationships, but because taboos are considered hot, and this is smut. The kicker was when the veil was lifted off Akane\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character. I could totally get that she gets satisfaction of being a calculating, manipulative and a bona fide bitch to those she sleeps with, but the fact that she goes out of her way to rub salt into her teenaged student\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emotional wounds that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sleeping with the man she loves, while also sleeping with another teenaged student on the side, just reaches a new high of absurdity. How much more cartoonish of a villain can you get? She has no care in the world that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s giving a Hanabi, who deeply resents her, a lot of ammo to get her into legal trouble\u00e2\u0080\u0093a total lack of morality. Akane basically takes a dump on your suspension of disbelief, what reason would make sense for her to be like this? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smutty melodrama for smutty melodrama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake.\n\nAesthetically, studio Lechre did a great number adapting Mengo Yokoyari\u00e2\u0080\u0099s manga, opting for a softer look to its characters, using very thin outlines, tonal shading, and a limited sombre colour palette. Combined with this, the show features quality detailed backgrounds and great use of panelling, shot composition and special effects\u00e2\u0080\u0094like the splashes of ink and watercolour paint on certain scenes to portray the multiple facets of emotion from its characters. The animation is fine, as, for the most part, the show prefers shots that linger on still images over moving animation. The way that the sex scenes are presented just makes the phrase \u00e2\u0080\u009csex sells\u00e2\u0080\u009d more prominent here, and that just destroys any message the show tries to convey through it. While its mostly used to simply accent the more comedic and emotional moments, the soundtrack is forgettable. Both Opening and Ending is trying really hard with the symbolic imagery and song choices, especially the Ending, it becomes cringeworthy\u00e2\u0080\u0094refer to the flowers as an example. \n\nEveryone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arcs resolve with the tension of that of a wet paper towel. Scum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Wish simultaneously puts its characters in cruel situations while treating them like fragile objects that can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t suffer the slightest nudge, lest they break which weakens any emotional impact. The story has nothing to offer beyond the relationship drama, no one feels like a real person with a life, even if a miserable one. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a story-driven show under the guise of being a character-driven one. As a result, when the group of one-dimensional characters that are defined by their issues are lumped in with an over-the-top character like Akane, the contrast is blindingly apparent that she seems almost alien for how much she stands out among them. A point to bring up again, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a jarring problem is there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a single time throughout this entire series that a character will legitimately enjoy a sexual encounter. In the odd cases where they do, they feel some resentment, usually towards themselves. To be blunt, if you are looking for a show that looks at sex in a way that is mature or realistic, this is not the show for you because every time it wants to be mature about sex it devolves into immature melodrama that stretches reason beyond intrigue.\n\nWhat has become clear after re-watching this series while writing the review, is that the characters are far from the scum that they want to believe themselves to be. Majority of their problems are the result of having too pure of innocent true love. They all have sexual encounters, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always to heal their emotional wounds. The only character who actually acts kind of scummy is Sanae, who takes advantage of her friendship with Hanabi to knowingly overreach in her sexual advances. Instead of hating these characters, you just get bored, their journey doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really amount to anything when everything is solved by the natural force of time passing, and the characters are simply moving along whichever course is clear in front of them\u00e2\u0080\u0094and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just waiting and waiting for them to get to that point. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to perfectly predict who was going to end up with whom in the or exactly how they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d get there, but the journey doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take the viewer anywhere which isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t obvious. All in all, a Scum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Wish isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t scummier enough, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big objective the show failed at, which in turn, transforms this tale of a darker side of adolescent romance and well-being into a disdainful sexual melodrama of terminally boring kids, waiting to be noticed."}, {"id": 3794, "score": 5, "body": "Sitting through Pupa is like a half-baked high-schooler trying to will something into existence on his blank essay paper. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deserve any praise, what it does deserve is to be buried alive, along with School Days and every other abomination created from the anime industry, deep into the ground where it can never see the light of day again. I have already done the work for you and watched it on your behalf, below are the reasons why you shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother wasting your time on this piece of trash.\n\nDubbed \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Worst Anime of 2014\u00e2\u0080\u009d, Pupa is a little horror story about a brother and sister. One day, the sister becomes a strange monster that feasts on human flesh, then from there, it essentially becomes an edge lords wet dream\u00e2\u0080\u0094exploiting the audience for shock value, with no underlying rhyme or reason to it. On top of that, you have the combination of plot threads ending as soon as they begin. As for the story, it teases at having one, but ultimately goes nowhere, nothing makes any sense. Then when you think it can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get any worse, it has these blinding censorship bars that somehow makes the gore fest scenes even more of an eyesore. Scenes of eyes being gouged out feel routine and almost tame compared to the extreme dismemberment that other characters go through, sometimes while they're still alive\u00e2\u0080\u0094this show violently screams edge! Probably the absolute worst example is an episode-long scene of Yume eating her brother's innards while reciting \"Onii-Chan\" in a very sexually suggestive manner that would fit right in at a Lannister family reunion; it's not just incest, it's necrophiliac incest. \n\nWhy her brother? Because he has regenerative powers, for some reason. Thermian Fallacy? You got it! Thanks to the sounds and subtext of the whole ordeal, the entire scene was uncomfortable and almost nauseating. What was the point to this scene? The answer is nothing! Just like the rest of the show, didn't really make much sense either. The horror continues when Pupa actually ends on a totally irrelevant flashback, blatantly dodging any attempt to explain itself. If I didn't talk about this, I might have mistakenly given you a reason to watch this but trust me, there is none. The episodes are over before they start, like this one episode\u00e2\u0080\u0094where a different character is pregnant with some kind of monster of her own, poor explanation for it all, and this is the only scene that ever mentions it, immediately, it is abandoned in favour of other random nonsense. Honestly, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to remember most of the series aside from a select few scenes, because the remainder is boring, poorly-written, and relies on shock value. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a troll, it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t unintentionally humorous, and there's no air of mystery or suspense to any of this. \n\nThe characters are awfully bad, one-dimensional, unrelatable and lack intelligence. The visuals are completely atrocious and it's poorly animated, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but think, what on earth was studio DEEN even thinking? Filled with nonsensical dialogue and the background art never gives the viewers any real symbolism or atmosphere. Instead, you get red butterflies transmitting an evil flesh-eating disease\u00e2\u0080\u0094no real subtext, no underlying theme and zero layers to the atmosphere. The soundtrack is forgettable, the sounds effects are repetitive and gratuitous that it totally ruined the effect and voice acting is limited due to run-time and monstrosity of a script. With only 4 minutes episodes, what is the point of having an Opening and Ending? Especially when they are far from being interesting. Pupa rather insults us by trying to be edgy, surrealist, and experimental, but just ends up being a product of an incestuous love affair in all of its deformity. \n\nApparently the manga's supposed to be a lot better, but the anime doesn't exactly give anyone any good reason to find out. Pupa is a tragedy, the experience of watching this is like a beautiful sunset wasted on the blind, a gorgeous symphony wasted on the deaf, a fabulous meal wasted on someone who just joined Weight Watchers. There is a good reason why this series has such a low score and not positively received, its much deserving of a lower score. It ticks all the boxes on how to make incoherently poor anime. On top of all the bad decisions Pupa went for, it just had to take the incest route, right? Well, just goes to show that incest is \u00e2\u0080\u0098relatively\u00e2\u0080\u0099 boring."}, {"id": 3795, "score": 30, "body": "When I saw this was written by K\u00c5\u008dsuke Fujishima, author of \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh My Goddess!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou're Under Arrest\u00e2\u0080\u009d, I became mildly interesting in eX-Driver. I've found parts in his other series kinda fun, so I went into this hoping to get some fun out of it too. After watching it, I can see why this wasn't as popular as his other woks.\n\nSet at some point in the 22nd century, people no longer drive cars themselves, instead of relying on a computer with an artificial intelligence to drive for them. But when the AI systems start losing control, a team call eX-Drivers (or eX-D for short) are formed, driven by actual drivers, chase down the cars that have gone crazy.\n\nAnd at this point is where I started asking questions about the premise for it's plot.\n\nHow is there no one in the future that can drive a car besides the eX-Drivers? Are there no car enthusiasts that want the authentic experience? No people who don't trust the automated system in the cars and cites accident statistics, or at least talks about all of the news stories as a reason that they don't want to use this new technology? Not even a person who simply can't afford the AI cars, or simply doesn't care about the difference as long as they have a way of getting to where they're going?\n\nIt would have been at least something to see one of these concepts are a story arch, along with the main characters being sent somewhere at some point to where these cars don't even exist, like some small town in the middle of nowhere. I'm assuming the lack of development for anything to do with it's story is probably due to a low budget that couldn't afford more episodes. I'd assume that having K\u00c5\u008dsuke Fujishima behind this would have granted a few more episodes.\n\nWhile the plot leaks much to be desired, but what about the main characters. Our three main characters are Lorna, Lisa, and Soichi, three kids who are out titular eX-Drivers. And this is where the problems are compounded a bit. Why are out main three characters children? Why isn't there at least one adult character that is an adult helping them out? You could make that same argument about the world of Pokemon, but that's a fantasy world with fantasy creatures, and even adults appear every now and again in that franchise. EX-Driver is much more grounded in a realistic world.\n\nThere isn't much to said characters either. They're cliched archetypes that you'd see in a lot of boring anime. None of them get character development as a result of the show being so incredibly short. Not even a basic and obvious moral lesson for them to learn from.\n\nThe only interesting thing about this series is that it was weirdly predictive of the future. with cars that drive itself, along with it's own infrastructure. But since it doesn't really go into depth with the concept, it's not really worth watching because of it, and probably wouldn't get even much focus other than a brief mention of \"Oh hey, there was one series written by the guy who wrote Oh My Goddess!\" that predicted self-driving cars.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It doesn't even show off the cars all that well, and that's both the focus of the show and something K\u00c5\u008dsuke Fujishima has a personal interest in. Again, probably because it's limited episodes.\n\nI know it feels like I'm complaining about this series, but it's not the worst thing I've ever seen. At best, it's incredibly forgettable, at worst, it will annoy you with it's lack of anything interesting happening and lack explanation of exploration of its subject matter. EX-Driver is now hard to find on DVD, and i doubt anyone is clambering for a re-release."}, {"id": 3798, "score": 35, "body": "Surprisingly, eX-Driver got a movie. Well, it calls itself a movie, it's more like an hour long direct-to-DVD special that managed to get a higher budget, which unfortunately means more shitty early 2000s anime CGI to go along with the better animation.\n\nAfter entering and winning a domestic preliminary round, our main trio of characters, Lisa, Lorna, and Soichi, advance to ex-Driver world race competition held in Los Angeles as representative team from Japan. Not long after arriving in LA, an AI car goes haywire, setting of a chain of events that lead out main trio in a conspiracy involving the race competition and some of the people involved with it.\n\nThe only thing I can compliment is the step up in animation. It's still not that good, but i guess it's something. The main trio of characters still don't get much in terms of development. But hey, since it's taking place somewhere else we get introduced to a whole new cast of characters. In this case, that's not a good thing.\n\nIf the original series of cliched archetypes, this \"movie\" has somewhat racist stereotypes, in the Italian-American and Chinese variety. I don't know who approved of these characters, but holy shit, someone needed to get fired. At least the main trio are slightly better in that I'm not as annoyed at them as I was in the series and they seem to have the bare minimum of an arch throughout the \"movie\". Which is twice as annoying, since the series is where all of the character development should have been.\n\nOverall, this movie is not that much more interesting than the series. We don't even get cheap jokes about the difference between how Japan and America deal with the way they deal with their AI cars.\n\nIf you didn't like or had no interest in the series, there's not much of a reason to watch this film. And since this is just barely better than the series, if only because of a bigger budget, there's not much reason to watch this outside of liking the original series. And I have to imagine that there aren't that many fans of the original series, let alone people who have even heard of it outside of looking for more of K\u00c5\u008dsuke Fujishima's work or someone happening to catch it on TV in their youth and enjoying it then."}, {"id": 3816, "score": 19, "body": "~~~img600(https://i.imgur.com/DcezWVe.png)~~~\n# ~~~This review contains __unmarked__ spoilers for Fullmetal Alchemist 2003.~~~\n# ~~~It __does not__ spoil Conqueror of Shamballa itself.\n~~~\n\n# Review in brief:\n\nConqueror of Shamballa attempts to be its own thing when it's a sequel to an anime with loose ends and completely fails to succeed as either.  It's almost as though this movie was initially a failed standalone pitch before being shoehorned into FMA as the 2003 anime was reaching its end.  As disappointing as FMA '03's ending was it's far better than anything that Conqueror of Shamballa has to offer.\n\n# Review in full:\n\nAnyone who finished FMA '03 knows that its ending was just a setup for a sequel.  Aside from the implicative final scene there were still a number of lingering questions regarding specific details from the show that were left unanswered.  This movie serves to end the anime-original storyline, but nothing more.  It has no desire to answer the questions the series left open and instead seeks to stand on its own as the final arc of the story.  This in itself raises serious questions about the validity of its setup (FMA '03's finale) but considering how much of the series' rules this movie forgets they may as well have just forgotten about what they had done before.  This is especially true when it comes to \"the gate\", the means by which alchemy acquired its energy to function in FMA '03.  The TV show went to great lengths to show that transmutations had a cost (except the last one that got Edward & Envy to Earth, apparently \"the gate\" stopped caring).  Now \"the gate\" arbitrarily lets people switch worlds (either freely or at a cost) so long as they can open it.  The old rules simply don't apply anymore, especially when you consider that a certain event at the movie's end involving \"the gate\" would render alchemy impossible according to the TV show, but the movie doesn't even consider this.\n\nEven within its own story, this movie features an unending torrent of plot holes & conveniences.  Many of these revolve around characters (and most of the characters at that) doing things not because it fits their presented character or because it's a sensible thing to do but simply because otherwise the plot would not have moved forward.  This wouldn't bother me as much if it wasn't the excuse for such events as Edward cheerfully deciding to miss the public unveiling of his past 2 years of work for a quick snooze because it was apparently the only simple way to set up the next scene, or Fritz Lang crashing the Beer Hall Putsch because he magically knew Edward would be there, or just about everything Hohenheim does.  The whole movie is like this too, in fact it's difficult to give examples without giving spoilers.  There's more hole than plot and it's not even funny.\n\n<center>img(https://i.imgur.com/LRU0faF.png)\n_By \"crash the Beer Hall Putsch\", I do mean Fritz crashed his 1920's automobile into the beer hall where the putsch was just kicking off._</center>\n\nNearly all of the characters (including the new main characters) are cardboard cutouts who are either only present to push the plot another step or enforce a stereotype because this movie likes to think it has a central message (it very well could have if it had actual characterization and could remember anything it said for more than 10 minutes but that is certainly not the case).  The few characters with any meaning to them derive all of it from the TV show, so while Edward has clearly matured since his state alchemist days and Alphonse (Elric, that is) has become bolder (and can fragment his soul to control objects now, no reason given as usual), none of the development is actually shown and rather is just what we're given from the get-go, which means that most of what they do is just set up to push the plot forward as well.  Meanwhile you have characters like the main villain who attacks the people she was supposed to get help from (because how else is someone who leads the antagonists supposed to look evil?) and Maes Hughes who has been reduced to a laughably shallow _evil nazi_ stereotype.\n\nIt's frustrating considering how little the setting has been tapped into by general media.  Weimar Republic Germany was a time of wild uncertainty with revolts and movements of just about every kind that would have been possible during the Interwar period.  Many of the important events and people associated with World War II were already set in place during this time, and Germany was at the center of it all.  Conqueror of Shamballa does tap into its setting (though events revolving around \"the gate\" and the antagonist Thule Society are the main focus) and provides an interesting (though hard to believe, mostly due to poor execution) theory regarding the Beer Hall Putsch.  The problem is that it has nothing to do with Fullmetal Alchemist and would have likely worked much better as a fully separate entity.  What few elements that were brought over from FMA almost all appear shoehorned in to remind the viewer that this is in fact a FMA sequel and certainly not something completely different.  FMA's world could have been swapped out with any other fantasy world without any other change.\n\n<center>img(https://i.imgur.com/vRr91e7.png)\n_Conqueror of Shamballa's graphics are quite standard for GameCube titles of its time._</center>\n\nFinally, this also isn't a movie that features worthwhile production values. The sound is merely alright with passable music, forgettable effects, and (in Japanese anyhow) voice-work that only could have gone as far as the flat characters who were speaking to begin with.  While the animation quality is generally slightly better than the TV show it also features highly dated CGI and plenty of stilted moments. There's definitely worse but there's something to be said when a 2005 movie can't truly improve over a 2003-04 multi-cour TV series.\n\n# Verdict:\n\nIt's the FMA '03 finale and it has so little to do with FMA that it's painful.  If you want a sequel that cleanly ends FMA '03 rest unassured that there are no answers, just holes.  If you want a good standalone movie set in the Weimar Republic then I regret to inform you that you won't find it here.  Those are the only two things this movie attempted to be.  You can skip this movie without missing anything worthwhile, in fact I wholeheartedly recommend avoiding it."}, {"id": 3858, "score": 30, "body": "_Things have been going... somewhat poorly, with Subject T-33.

Why are we here? Are we alone in this universe? And the most asked question of all time is how can an anime studio adapt such an abomination of a Light Novel? The author behind Ore ga Suki nano wa Imouto dakedo Imouto ja Nai (My Sister, My Writer) in Seiji Ebisu is one of the many reasons why Light Novels and their adaptations have such a bad reputation. Not only is most of the writing from Light Novel authors amateurish but they all tend to have some sort of divorce from reality and when it is put on to the big screens, you can clearly see it. A poor decision from a newly found studio in Magia Doraglier to make this their first title while collaborating with studio NAZ, hoping that the sexual incestuous factor would pull in some coin from some horny teens, but instead, it backfired, leading to some of the most horrendous visuals I have seen in a very, very long time.\n\nIf you think that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to get some sort of quality story, interesting characters or comedy then you have come to the wrong place. Yuu Nagami is your typical beta male loser in high school. He is an inspiring light novelist, in fact, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s his one dream in life to become a published author. He enters various competitions in order to get his work acknowledged. Each day brings a new rejection from an aforementioned contest, but, from out of nowhere, his sister shocks him with the news that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s won the very novel writing contest that he failed miserably to qualify for\u00e2\u0080\u0094and not just that but the novel in question is a \u00e2\u0080\u0098forbidden love\u00e2\u0080\u0099 tale between a younger sister and an older brother. And to complicate matters more, his sister wants him to be the one to take credit for the novel, as she can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t risk being the one responsible for its creation. In contrast to his sister, Suzuka Nagami, who probably has all the tropes her character allows, is your typical doting but controlling young sister-type-of-character. The setting and our main protagonists are pretty much a mirrored version of Eromanga Sensei with the main difference being that Yuu and Suzuka are blood-related. They have it easy you know because, with incest, Yuu never has to worry about taking his \u00e2\u0080\u0098girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to meet the parents. The rest of the characters are just there to fill the ever-growing harem whom all happen to be cute or have big breasts and an artificial desire in wanting to bone Yuu. \n\nA teenage girl asks her dad if she can borrow the car. Dad says \u00e2\u0080\u009cOk, but you know what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to do for it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So, she starts to give him head but stops quickly and says \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour dick tastes like shit!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dad says \u00e2\u0080\u009coh, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right; your brother has the car!\u00e2\u0080\u009d After you have that mental image stuck in your head, do you still like incest? Do you think this \u00e2\u0080\u0098taboo\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is still hot? If so, then this show is still not for you! The art and animation are pretty much like that incest joke, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s repulsive and ugly, sometimes, unintentionally hilarious that it enters meme territory. When you have fans from Japan literally crying, \u00e2\u0080\u009csakuga houkai,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which translates to, \u00e2\u0080\u009canimation collapse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in a series such as this, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very telling on how bad it really is. Not only is the character designs dull and have this early-2000s look where they have those \u00e2\u0080\u0098weirdly-overly-sized\u00e2\u0080\u0099 eyes that seem to float aimlessly on a disproportionate face, but, everything else from the characters anatomy, backgrounds and objects seem to change size and form from shot to shot. It's like it encourages viewers to play a game every 2 minutes of \u00e2\u0080\u009cspot the mistake.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The production of My Sister, My Writer got insanely bad that the animators sent out an SOS type of code message in the ED of its 6th episode.\n\nNot a good start for Magia Doraglier and for studio NAZ, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a permanent stain on their record. When the hideous art is in motion, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably comparable to literally seeing blood siblings banging each other, you know, all kinds of wrong. The score is not memorable either, and both OP and ED aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even worth watching through. Although this show consists of all the fetishes that people like to get off on from incest, feet, phone sex and dominatrix, fans of these things are better off looking elsewhere for a similar setting. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty much safe to say that this is one of the worst anime I have ever seen, and a great example of the state of Light Novel stories and characters. I understand that lowly paid creators have to hustle, write a bit of sex and hook the readers in, of course, not every media you consume has to be some solidly written piece of literature, so this story will fit perfectly next to novels such as \"Flirting with Beast Girls! Doing nothing but Copulation!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \"My Little Sister got Hemorrhoids, So I helped her Insert the Suppository,\u00e2\u0080\u009d so let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not even pretend we are seeing anything phenomenal shall we? \n\nThere is an unspoken rule in the anime fandom that we all need to remember from here on out, if an ecchi anime has a really long name, odds are, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to be good. It just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t offer anything to be enjoyed, especially when the dialogue is abysmal and predictable with key phrases that have been recycled through many similar shows. When you combine all of these things with a one-dimensional cast, the flaws are extremely glaring and impossible to ignore, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty much the result of a smutty theme crashing against a wall with all the clich\u00c3\u00a9s that could ever exist. My Sister, My Writer looks and sounds like a deformed child from an incestuous relationship, its \u00e2\u0080\u0098romance\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and \u00e2\u0080\u0098comedy\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is third-rate and its fanservice is basically, \u00e2\u0080\u009csakuga houkai!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Avoid at all costs!"}, {"id": 3881, "score": 1, "body": "#~~~__Disclaimer__~~~#\n___Sorry if this review mixes up some of the plot-related facts from episode 8-12.

Its flaws, in my opinion, are apparent, and it bothers me how the community has lauded this series. The most annoying part about the first act of this series was the constant need for flashbacks. \n\nProblem 1, the length: We are dealing with an incredibly short season(12 episodes) this means that every moment of screen time has to count. The plot is primed to move forward. And yet entire episodes are dedicated to flashbacks which tend to have a lot of useless meat like potatoe girl or just being the snow flashback. It also is used for lazy exposition practically telegraphing plot elements and spoon feeding info to the audience. Shows like Breaking Bad do their flashbacks right. Short little bits that create intrigue or shows like Berserk which orient us. Additionally, the length cut out of all of the politics. We lose that entire plot thread because the story is wasting its time. \n\nProblem 2, flow: The biggest concern with the flashbacks is the effect on the pace. We end season 1 with a mystery, but we fall to a screeching halt with awkward, occasionally pointless flashbacks. The makes the show crawl like a snail and makes the tone switch all the more apparent. This switch is where they rush the Armored Titan review. There is little to no precedent for this and feels so out of place. It is also terribly telegraphed in the flashbacks, so it lacks any punch. Its as if they went oh shit, we have wasted our first six episodes time to speed up the plot and throw a lot of bullshit in(Eren's special powers). \n\n\nIndeed, the latter half of the season is a complete cluster fuck. In contrast, with the slow exciting fights of the first season, the second season rushes everything. Fights lack tension and weight, and the story jumps from plot beat to plot beat. Eren's powers are thrown out of a hat. This creates a very bizarre a style change. In the first season, the plot slowly built up, and small bits were fed to the audience. This kept us intrigued and interested. The odd change in style cheapens the last episode and leaves me confused and sad rather than excited and invested.

For as long as I can recall since first getting into anime several years ago (a somewhat late bloomer), the Japan entertainment industry has been producing countless numbers of anime TV shows, films, book series, and physical and digital anime merchandise, many of which are designed to fulfill the numerous different fetishes of millions of anime/manga/LN fans alike. In this current era, the drive by Japan to fuel such fetishes, which aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as positively looked upon by most of the audience outside the country (especially the Western side), has become more and more apparent. This includes a certain recurring category known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cincest\u00e2\u0080\u009d, otherwise called brocon or siscon, depending on the focused relations. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I need to specify why \u00e2\u0080\u009cincest\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a very sketchy and infamous term (that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s someone else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job, not mine). While this genre is not necessarily a terrible option in terms of writing a story, it is very easy to mess up the premises and key elements of that story. For this particular show, known in English as \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy Sister, My Writer\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.well, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just say...it really messed up EVERYTHING.\n\nSTORY: 0/10\nYes, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not kidding. BIG. FAT. ZERO. (ofc MAL doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the \u00e2\u0080\u009c0\u00e2\u0080\u009d option, though)\nLemme explain the setup here first:\nThe little sister character, Suzuka Nagami, is in middle school and already looking like a prodigy. She has excellent grades, is the student council president, and is the author, under the pen name of \u00e2\u0080\u009cTowano Chikai\u00e2\u0080\u009d, of an award-winning light novel which is, unsurprisingly, about a little sister with quite the brotherly complex. The little sister does most of the housework due to the two living together without their parents\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.\n-------------\nAlright, pause! By this time already, this is where I think this show really starts to accumulate with problems: the all-too-convenient plot device of no parents or even guardians physically showing up whatsoever\u00e2\u0080\u00a6in fact, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even a stretch for the mom or dad to even be mentioned as often as they should\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recall them really ever bringing up much important stuff regarding their parents, regardless of whether they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re dead or alive. With no parental figures to keep the sibling\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mishaps at bay, the story basically sets itself up for disaster from the very get-go. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just the tip of the iceberg, which I probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to cover entirely, cause that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how dreadful the situation is.\n---------------\nThe big brother character here, Yuu Nagami, is an ordinary high schooler aspiring to become an LN author; however, his efforts have been unsuccessful up to this point, all because he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make enough \u00e2\u0080\u009clittle sister\u00e2\u0080\u009d type characters. (Okay, wtf, not every god damn good story needs an imouto character, ffs!). Predictably enough, the latest contest was won by none other than Suzuka, his own little sister.\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the problem, Suzuka can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t accept the prize for winning because revealing her true identity to the public eye would ruin her reputation in school and toward her parents (who shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really care that much, anyway). So what does she do? She convinces Yuu to assume as the identity of \u00e2\u0080\u009cTowano Chikai\u00e2\u0080\u009d in her place, and keep that identity for an undefined period of time. This kind of setup can only go wrong, and then some\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.\nThroughout the entirety of the show, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t made clear if the series wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trying to be a parody show or trying to be anything serious. Either way, whatever the case, it fails to be any one of the two, or even a combination of the two. It is a messy assortment of events where Yuu and/or Suuzuka is subjected to numerous absurd situations and events, which are usually started up by the handful of ubquitious and recurring support characters. There is no sense of story progression whatsoever; it seems that each episode tries to focusing on coming up with a painfully awkward or stupid gag or trope, seemingly trying to conjure up some sort of \u00e2\u0080\u009cpositive\u00e2\u0080\u009d comedy value, which is practically non-existent after at most the first two episodes. The physical settings themselves don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help much, if at all; the typical school campus, anime convention areas, and those obligatory scenes that just beg for fanservice\u00e2\u0080\u00a6aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly complementary or appealing in terms of trying to keep the viewers from being bored. The show then tries to implement some sort of setup for intended serious drama or conflict between the sister and the brother near the end; however, due to the lack of story progression, as mentioned earlier, as well as the lack of complexity and structure in the narrative (if there really is any at all to begin with), the forced drama comes off as just an extremely weak and nonsensical attempt to conclude what was already an aimless and pointless plot.\n\nSOUND/ANIMATION: 1/10\nRegarding of whatever the explanation is, given the way how it went, there is no half-decent excuse for how the animation quality just dip down like a stock market crash. Honestly, the character designs weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily awful at the very beginning, but as the series went along, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as if the animation staff themselves have gotten sick and/or bored of the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cringe-fest premises and non-existent story progression (which I can totally understand, if that was really the case\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.though I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not someone who knows everything behind the scenes). The result? Utterly \u00e2\u0080\u009cfugly\u00e2\u0080\u009d animation quality. With each following episode, the characters just seem to become more and more deformed, to the point where one can say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legitimately laborious to even take a glance at them. The clear laziness or lack of motivation of the animation staff is so apparent here, and considering it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the same studio whom did another infamous and \u00e2\u0080\u009cturrible\u00e2\u0080\u009d show called Hajimete no Gal, it makes a lot of sense.\n\nThe soundtracks aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really that downright awful, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at most half-decent\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.nothing really memorable that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d want to download onto your PC, iPod, or any similar device. The voice acting is rather lackluster and feels very fabricated in nature, even with the intended fanservice and comedic moments (or moments intended to be comedic, to restate that). I really felt like I should\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had a drinking contest for each time someone in the show says \u00e2\u0080\u009conii-chan\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009conii-san (O-Nissan)\u00e2\u0080\u009d, despite me not being an individual with a liking for alcoholic beverages.\n\nCHARACTERS: 0/10\nYes, once again. BIG. FAT. ZERO.\nNot only the characters are one-dimensional, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re so generic in a bad way and are pretty much written horribly; I wanted to believe that the bad writing for them was intentional to function as part of a parody. They seem to be just made simply for the sakes of stressing the pointless gags and absurd situations centering around the notorious tropes of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cimouto\u00e2\u0080\u009d genre. The interpersonal dialogue among them feels dead and/or forced for the most part, and ultimately doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t achieve anything in terms of giving any sort of positive characterization.\nThis is pretty much the rundown of the recurring cast:\n\nSuzuka is the \u00e2\u0080\u009cperfectionist\u00e2\u0080\u009d little sister who wants her big brother to do her, but is wishy-washy anyways when related subjects are mentioned, anyways.\n\nYuu is the practically useless big brother who has to overreact to literally every single statement or remark thrown at him from the members of his self-forming harem.\n\nReika is the typical bossy MILF (possibly) novel editor, and the gag with her is her self-declared solutions are to have Yuu grope her cow tits \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor research\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nAhegao Double Peace Sensei (yes, she has cow tits, too, I know) is the annoying ero-novel illustrator who won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shut the hell up about her nickname and her fetishes. \n\nMai is that one overly rich girl intended as a love rival and pretty much just an addition to the self-made harem around Yuu.\n\nSakura is yet another annoying addition to the harem who only wants to be Yuu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cimouto\u00e2\u0080\u009d (and won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t frigging stop referring to him as \u00e2\u0080\u009coni-san\u00e2\u0080\u009d), much to Suzuka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chargrin, and ultimately an obligated catalyst for the drama attempt near the end of the show.\n\nThe Kanzaka twins are honestly the only characters I did try to like, but in the end, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really just the typical twins with contrasting personalities and preferences, and are merely just part of the collective friend circle. They, of course, like the rest of the recurring female cast here, also showed obvious signs of wanting (or kinda wanting, at least) the \u00e2\u0080\u009cJohnson\u00e2\u0080\u009d of you-know-who.\n\nIn short, these characters are not only generic and clich\u00c3\u00a9 (which isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily bad by itself), but also poorly written and managed.\n\nENJOYMENT: 1.5/10\nFor the first few episodes, I legitimately did try to enjoy it, and it did have its comedic value at one point, but not for very long. Honestly, I was hoping at least to find entertainment in poking fun and calling out the numerous shenanigans in the show. However, as the animation quality fell, the story progression becoming non-existent, and the characters becoming more and more obnoxious, it went to the point where I could no longer physically record reactions to the episodes as an YouTube anime reactor. Watching a new episode every week actually became pretty much a legitimate chore, to where I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve really had my obligation to \u00e2\u0080\u009cnever drop unless it becomes 100%+ unbearable or tasteless\u00e2\u0080\u009d really tested. \n\nThis is one of those shows where I can actually say is \u00e2\u0080\u009cobjectively bad\u00e2\u0080\u009d in all facets, and to where I felt grateful to have at least watched the likes of Eromanga Sensei (another recent, more well-known \u00e2\u0080\u009cimouto\u00e2\u0080\u009d show), which, while understandbly flawed, functioned a lot better in terms of character management, story-writing, and animation quality.\nAn even better alternative for an actually good \u00e2\u0080\u009cimouto\u00e2\u0080\u009d show would be Imouto sae Ireba Ii (A Sister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s All You Need). The cast of that show consist of more physically mature characters but with more realistic traits and personal issues. The gags are also much better and more well-executed, and more of the focus in the show is on the characterization of the cast, which worked well even without a deep story. The characters also have more life to them in terms of their interpersonal dialogue and unfiltered remarks, comments, etc.\nWhile I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve watched enough \u00e2\u0080\u009cimouto\u00e2\u0080\u009d shows to literally make a public political statement about how I feel about them, I can safely say that this particular series is one of the worst shows I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever watched in general.\n\nFINAL WORD:\nThis show is not worth your time, regardless if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a casual and/or open-minded viewer.\nAvoid this dumpster like the plague at ALL COSTS.\nThere are WAY better shows of the same variety out there.\nIf you hate doing chores, heed my warning.

How? What. The. Actual. F*CK!? It makes zero effort to hide the fact that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only selling point is sex, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so shameless that it even spams promotions of its website, almost begging its audiences to go there for some A1 \u00e2\u0080\u0098bleeding the weasel\u00e2\u0080\u0099 material. And speaking of weasels, there is a racoon-looking panda named Mana, a mascot of the show that not only explains the shitty jokes but also screams a bunch of synonyms for sex without even bothering to be witty about it. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that Mana is also a molester because, you know, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Japan.\n\nAfter some exposition on how great first-time sex is and how it only hurts for females\u00e2\u0080\u0094by the most annoying character of the Fall season in Mana\u00e2\u0080\u0094our main protagonist in Itsuki Yuge has to \u00e2\u0080\u0098bang\u00e2\u0080\u0099 12 maidens in addition to his cousin, Mahiru Konatsukiso, so that the world can be saved. \u00e2\u0080\u009cClassmating,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a holy ritual to produce Star Children, is the intersection of the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dungeon crawling and social aspects. This means it spends the majority of the time doing it. Conception makes it clear that 'classmating' is not actually copulation\u00e2\u0080\u0094instead, characters are making physical contact as they combine their spiritual energy to birth children. It's the implied and not-so-implied gestures during that ritual that make it far more graphic. Well, that was for the first few episodes but that gets thrown out the window that left viewers in confusion saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat happened to the love thing being a holy ritual?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Because now we have threesomes, censor bars over actual penetration. Being tongue-in-cheek about presenting the ecchi-harem-isekai while doing nothing new with them is just obnoxious. If it was about sex being a major plot point then why didn't it just be a hentai show? \n\nIt would make sense to go the hentai route instead of blue balling its fanbase with the trashy premise and a football team-sized harem of anime beauties: The cousin, Mahiru. The \u00e2\u0080\u0098Wants to bone her Brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lookalike\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Reone. The template tsundere, Ruka. The standard Loli\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, Colette and Yuzuha.

On the surface, the divide seems clear: on one side lies those vocal to their displeasure of even the sheer existence of this series, labelling it as edgy, repugnant and pornographic. Some going even so far as comparing the anime to Nazi propaganda decades ago. And on the opposing side lies the fandom, constantly upset by criticism their beloved show receives and reverting to insults and name-calling them with popular phrases such as the dreaded \u00e2\u0080\u009cSJW\u00e2\u0080\u009d for example. But these are simply gross generalisations of both the series and its viewers, centring upon a small group of outspoken individuals that unfortunately leads any attempt of discourse astray. Instead my aim here is to hopefully bring a more critical view on Goblin Slayer to the discussion; of the series\u00e2\u0080\u0099 perceived intent, as well as numerous faults and issues prevalent throughout its first season.\n\n_\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe gods of light, order and fate, and the gods of darkness, chaos and coincidence decided to throw dice in order to determine which side would rule the world. The gods threw the dice over and over and over again, until they began to feel faint.\u00e2\u0080\u009d_\n\nGoblin Slayer is a dark fantasy anime adapted from both the manga and light novels of the same name, highly inspired by tabletop role-playing games. Initially the story follows a young woman known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cPriestess\u00e2\u0080\u009d that has recently become an adventurer and joins an upstart party on her first quest. Their naivety and inexperience ultimately lead to their grim demise, ravaged by goblins who commit heinous acts such as rape and dismemberment depicted in much more graphic fashion compared to other fantasy anime of recent years. Before the Priestess can be dispatched however, the actual protagonist appears from the shadows, intent of massacring every goblin in sight. From this point, the series is predominantly focused on this mysterious adventurer commonly referred to as \u00e2\u0080\u009cGoblin Slayer\u00e2\u0080\u009d and his efforts to exterminate the entire goblin species.\n\nThe beginning to this story gives what I believe to be a clear sense of what Goblin Slayer strives to be. Simplistic, cheerful dialogue to elucidate fundamentals of the adventurer system, a light-hearted tone able to create a strong optimistic mood, even the visuals and audio utilizing light colours for character designs coupled with an upbeat tune all try and convey a presentation akin to the typical fantasy anime of recent memory. The group of upstart adventurers each can be seen representing archetypes one would expect to be present in such a series: tsundere, loli character, main character for a harem, etc. Numerous times before a goblin appears on screen, subtle signs are revealed about the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lack of preparation and expectation to indicate this quest will not be as successful as they hope, and then what follows is a shocking realization of what the world of Goblin Slayer truly entails. Essentially these characters were tools for the series to subvert people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s initial expectations of the story, with the tragic events that entail further emphasizing this point. The sickening portrayal and detail of these actions going to further lengths than most anime fans have probably ever experienced previously in the medium. Disgusting to watch even for the short time shown, and from the reception this anime received, it looks to have garnered the initial reaction staff had intended. From this perspective, while many can find these scenes crass and tactless in their depiction, I find it difficult to call this part of Goblin Slayer lazy writing.\n\nShortly followed by the introduction of the titular protagonist reveals a change that strongly contrast to events that just transpired earlier. Compared to the almost wilfully ignorant upstart adventurers that end up decimated to the lowest mob type in the world, Goblin Slayer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach to killing goblins is much more tactical. Shown to analyse nearly every time he murders a single goblin, often determining the most effective method for slaughtering the mob step-by-step before executing his strategy in cold, calculated fashion. Through this he not only personifies the kind of badass main character one would expect for a darker fantasy story, but also provides a solid understanding of how a high-level adventurer would be expected to act in battle. Armed with various weapons and antidotes whilst always on the lookout for signs, Goblin Slayer has enough tools at his disposal to face any goblin he would come across. A clear juxtaposition to how many inexperienced adventurers would conduct themselves. Him slaughtering the horde also raises an intriguing question of Goblin Slayer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s morality when intending to murder the child goblins. While the protagonist remains steadfast of his opinion on the species, the Priestess brings forth the possibility of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood goblin\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Despite going through with eliminating them, he does admit there could be one out there. From this, viewers have a grasp on how this tale could further develop this idea with having both character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ethics challenged as Goblin Slayer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quest continues. There is potential in this tale to be more than just the fun schlock of the season. Unfortunately, that potential slowly gets squandered every episode following, and personally even loses the series\u00e2\u0080\u0099 initial appeal.\n\nOne of the more detrimental choices I find a story can make is following an attempt to create a purposeful, serious tone, and then reverting to what it tried to distance itself from initially. After Goblin Slayer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shocking start that firmly established the story as a dark fantasy that supposedly takes itself seriously, the anime takes an odd change in tone that is rather baffling to understand. Numerous quests later in the series showcase characters in a way you would never have expected in Goblin Slayer, with an array of playful, trifling scenes one would more commonly associate with a slice-of-life anime than this show. Somehow the series decided to skip on possibly showing some of the effects trauma experienced from death, sexual assault or even just being an adventure can have on a person, instead these scenes barely contribute to the characters on a notable level. The change in tone can lead to breaks in one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s immersion of the story and the protagonist it follows, with transitions feeling awkward and out of place more often than not. A notorious example can be found in episode 2 where the episode cuts to a well-endowed redhead girl waking out of bed and stretching, followed by some of the most prominent jiggle physics to be found this season. I thought this was meant to be a serious tale. For a dark fantasy to work, usually it requires the atmosphere of a series to remain constant enough to a degree where the earnestness and consequences of actions can still be felt through the more cheerful scenes. Berserk, Attack on Titan and Fullmetal Alchemist 2003 are just some examples of dark fantasy anime that constantly have a sombre air about them, constantly felt when witnessing the actions of their characters. Goblin Slayer lacks this air that breezes alongside the narrative and whilst continuing to lack a strong sense of identity in a genre already spoiled by an abundance of generic fantasy, it is more inclined to leave a stale taste in the mouths of those hoping for Goblin Slayer to distance itself further from its contemporaries.\n\nThis lack of an identity also permeates the narrative and overarching worldbuilding to a degree that I have to address. When a series attempts to be a subversion or even a deconstruction of a genre, normally this would involve acknowledging tropes typically associated with a genre whilst subverting their intentions. Goblin Slayer, at least in its first season, does not do this. Alongside the series constantly switching the tone between dark and nonchalant, the anime seems to never want to take its world very seriously despite the premise. Goblin Slayer is a man who has an unrelenting obsession to kill goblins as they are a species that lingers on as a problem for innocent people. They are weak creature with childlike intelligence individually, but as a mob are a destructive force which can lead to the devastation of entire towns. An interesting yet believable problem in this world. So then, how is it believable to think that there is only one person that acts in response to this problem? Because the anime has mainly taken place around a small town there is a possibility for other adventurers similar to Goblin Slayer to be primarily hunting goblins in their own areas of the world. But thinking on a large scale, if goblin mobs can and already have been a significant cause of wiping out various towns, would someone not think that their effect to agriculture and the overall economy poses a severe threat on a national scale, to where even adventurers seeking glory and fame would end up losing money? I would have at least expected some form of intervention \u00e2\u0080\u0093 here is an idea: have some adventurers hired as a form of security for farmers against a potential goblin attack. Or at least have the guild girl not allow novices to take these jobs when it is made apparent how many novices and kidnapped and killed off by goblin mobs! If so many are dying because of this fact, maybe it would be best to intervene, even if with just a simple warning about how dangerous they are, and how prevalent this is. If only Goblin Slayer had more consistency in its world that more people could admire, instead of trying to subvert common fantasy anime tropes and then as if almost contradictory to itself maintaining a level of unbelievability behind how these aspects work in its story.\n\nIt is upsetting how a show essentially fails at fleshing out the more complex issues the world of Goblin Slayer encompasses, especially when most of the defence for this anime in regards to certain actions and events is derived from insular logic. A common complaint for the series initially was based around why goblins rape, and while it certainly is specified that rape is their only option for reproduction, that does not cover details about their creation. Goblins here are force-of-nature villains that embody evil and chaos, thus not requiring distinct personalities and from this the rape shown can be considered a further way of emphasizing that point thus bringing them to where they can be considered irredeemable, but this only works on a narrative level. All works of fiction are made with intentions from their creator/s and by peeling down the layers of in-universe context is one able to search for the purpose and intentions behind specific scenes, actions, etc. Often termed the Thermian Argument, it claims that pointing to a show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s logic in response to criticism of the subject matter is inherently fallacious. It supports a difference between what is being depicted and why such is being depicted at all; a metanarrative point of view. I stated what I believed to be the main intention behind such shocking acts in the first episode as a way for the show to subvert the audience for what kind of anime they were in store for, but after witnessing the series make that idea almost completely irrelevant through poor direction, tonal dissonance and having such actions repeated onscreen later with similarly crude framing for reasons even I am unsure of, it is hard to defend the series for all these creative choices happening numerous times throughout the anime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s duration from a metanarrative point of view.\n\nCharacterization is one of Goblin Slayer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focal points if even only applying to one individual so far. Goblin Slayer is the embodiment of a man who refuses to die before his purpose in life is seen through to the end. Driven by revenge after goblins took away the person most precious to him, he epitomizes the idea of how a badass protagonist should act. His character design is also impressive in certain scenes with a red eye theme glowing in the darkness that oozes a killer instinct rarely found in anime nowadays. Reminder that the in-universe creation of the series was founded on gods rolling dice and playing the game of chance, with all various races and species being birthed purely for their amusement. But with the way Goblin Slayer acts, he can be considered the one character in this world to defy the will and wishes of those who created him. And while there are numerous examples of him conveniently surviving so far due to plot armour, the intent remains \u00e2\u0080\u0093 underneath his monotonous voice and implied social awkwardness lies the potential for a metaphorical figure of inspiration. Unfortunately, that is where most of the praise for characters ends at this point in the anime. Every character besides Goblin Slayer receives little attention in the anime, with minimal development bar the Priestess who acts as a rookie slowly growing and learning how to survive as an adventurer in this harsh world, however even this has made little progress this first season. Other characters sprinkled across the story range from other rookies slowly improving and gaining experience to dependable fighters often able to hold their own in battle, which is a striking difference compared to how most typically act away from any battlefield; childish and immature. Honestly, besides Priestess and Goblin Slayer the rest of the cast are easily expendable, but I guess that is to be expected when the supporting cast includes names such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cDwarf\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cLizardman\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Hopefully if there is a sequel, they have a better opportunity to leave a lasting impression on the anime.\n\nMuch like these forgettable characters the production quality for Goblin Slayer also failed to leave a strong impact. The art is not very detailed, with most character designs and backgrounds often appearing plain and generic for most of the season. A mixture of 2D and 3D animation is used to jarring effect, with most action scenes and the occasional panning shot relying on CGI that look more like an eyesore that anything visually pleasing. In fact, most of the better-looking shots involve scenes lacking any sort of movement. Disappointing as the artwork is commonly seen as a key strength to the manga\u00e2\u0080\u0099s popularity. For a series where the most basic appeal comes from a guy mowing down goblins, the action was underwhelming and that kills a show like this. Wish I could say otherwise for the soundtrack, but that also failed to leave a strong impression on me. Voice acting was solid but effectively crippled with a lacklustre script treating half the characters as dense. The opening theme was melancholic but failed to ever have me personally want to listen to it more than once. The ending theme while I certainly enjoyed it more was accompanied by CGI Goblin Slayer with clunky animation. At least the ending track was fun.\n\nGoblin Slayer is at its core, an anime about one man slaying goblins. Though it can tempt viewers with ideas of something greater at work, it still boils down to a mere schlocky action show with lacklustre presentation that by the end of its first season has its biggest strengths stemming from potential and a hope that a sequel can further flesh out characters and worldbuilding which at this point cannot hold up to scrutiny. But it does have its appealing qualities no matter how superficial they might be. If you are willing to take a chance on a simple action anime trying to break the trend of generic fantasy released this year, this might be worth your investment. My main hope is that now with the most controversial anime of the year finished, the community at large can learn from this experience. As the old saying goes: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat which does not kill us makes us stronger.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n"}, {"id": 3930, "score": 20, "body": "It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe to say that if it weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for series such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cConception\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy Sister, My Writer\u00e2\u0080\u009d airing this Fall, then Goblin Slayer, without a shadow of a doubt, would take home the title of \u00e2\u0080\u009cWorst Anime of the Season.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an anime that yearns to be Berserk but fails miserably. An anime that sacrifices everything in service of a threadbare plot with zero long-term emotional impact, along with gratuitous fanservice and surface level vileness for vileness\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake. It's the classic case of trying to have its cake and eat it too, which is very telling in its premiere episode that caused one of the most controversial moments in recent time\u00e2\u0080\u0094in order to vilify the enemies in this story and darken its tone from a seemingly happy-go-lucky JRPG world, it gave every excuse possible to use rape as a shock factor to hook viewers in\u00e2\u0080\u0094It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually woven into every fabric of the story that it is literally impossible to avoid talking about rape when discussing Goblin Slayer. \n\nThe writing is beyond abysmal that there are numerous contradictions in its worldbuilding that is so glaring that it cannot be ignored. In addition to this, every character is one-dimensional and so generic to the point of being incapable of having a moment of introspection, having personal goals that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t revolve around the main protagonist, and they have no names since the author states in an interview that he is bad with them. So, the characters are referred to, as their character classes since this fantasy is set up like a tabletop RPG. Being the cardboard cut-outs that they are, almost the entirety of their dialogue consists of only talking about the main hero of the story and his goblin quests, his name is\u00e2\u0080\u0094get this\u00e2\u0080\u0094Goblin Slayer (will refer to him as GS). He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a stoic man, barely says a sentence, hardly ever takes his armour and helmet off, and is your typical Marty-Stu who overcomes the impossible, and has a harem of anime beauties that love him for the shallowest of reasons. His only defining characteristic is his edgy glowing red eye.\n\nNot only does the audience have to suffer through these plastic characters but also the villains are alike, which are the goblins. These creatures represent the evil of the world and their purpose is to simply destroy and multiply. This is where the story and worldbuilding reach the lowest depths of terrible writing. The goblins are underestimated in this world and acknowledged as a non-priority, despite these inworld facts: The first being that goblins are weak and a low threat; they have the size, strength and intelligence of human children. The second being, goblins are well known to be dangerous; they massacre, rape and pillage, some can even cast deadly spells. If goblins are so weak and stupid that a normal villager is capable of killing one, then how can they do everything in the second inworld fact? Why does the show continue to preach how goblins are level 1 mob but also tell us how history and current time teaches about the notoriety of the goblins? It is later explained that goblins can evolve into higher classes if they live long enough where they will gain experience, learn to organize. This contradicts the first inworld fact\u00e2\u0080\u0094let's say for argument's sake, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an unreliable piece of information, then how is it possible for the population to believe something so contradictory to the fact of the world?\n\nGoblins have an immediate impact on the citizens as well as its economics. A villager gets pushed aside despite begging the guild and government for adventurer and military aid to defend their hamlets and farms from hordes of goblins, but since this incoherent story makes them out to be a small issue, he gets ignored. The adventurers wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it for free either since they are all assholes who only do things for money and glory. It makes you question the common sense, ethics and morality of this world. Especially when the villagers are responsible for the farming\u00e2\u0080\u0094crops and livestock, mining, crafting and architecture. If you remove GS from the story, it collapses straight away since he is the only person who takes these quests besides rookies, who basically end up dead as mention by the guild. Why are they underestimated when the majority of new adventurers, who take on goblin quests, die? How can the world remain this na\u00c3\u00afve when this occurrence is frequent and goblin attacks are so abundant? It literally makes zero sense. With GS out of the picture, all the goblin nests shown in the story, multiply to insane numbers, the goblins will gain experience and evolve, led by more Goblin Lords and will pillage all the hamlets and farms, raped numerous women and eventually take over the main towns.\n\nI don't get the reasoning made for goblins to rape. Yes, I understand in the story that they have to use females from other races to procreate since they are all born males, but that's the Thermian Fallacy! I'm asking specifically the logic behind this from a meta point of view. The author made them beings of pure evil to cause chaos and pain but gives them the glaring oversight of needing other race's females to reproduce. And from a serious narrative point of view, this only serves as a way to make goblins seem bad, e.g. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGoblins are bad, rape is bad, so goblins rape!\u00e2\u0080\u009d This is the main logic behind the reasoning given. It was a way to depict the goblins as spawns of evil and to establish that this is a dark and cruel world. The issue here is that having the goblins suddenly raping women is really unnecessary to achieve that goal, the story acts as if murder or torture is incapable of doing so. An obvious sign that values being dark and shocking over telling a story. The way they use rape is to make this show artificially darker for no reason other than being edgy - and that is what rape essentially is in Goblin Slayer, cheap shock value! \n\nIt is very rare for any fiction to be able to use rape to darken the tone of its world without turning that work into smut. If dark elements like rape could be removed and the story would be exactly the same, then those elements shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be here, to begin with. Relying on artificially added darkness only makes Goblin Slayer's story a piece of trash, far from mature and smart. Especially when these dark elements are selectively applied to everyone outside of GS bubble of happy-go-lucky JRPG world with his harem of anime beauties, which none of them gets raped during the current storyline. While everyone else is living in the goblin rape house game. At least Berserk has enough inworld consistency to subject important characters to the carnage. No, I'm not saying that equally raping everyone makes a better story but there is no consistency in the world of Goblin Slayer. In Berserk, rape is a reality that everyone may encounter. It is a clear message that the characters are squarely operating within the world's rules. It is not done frivolously either because the events did not put them out of the picture like some used goods. They become survivors and turned it into a narrative of strength and recovery, adding to their characters depth. They are trying to not let the act define them forever. And this is exactly where Goblin Slayer shamefully stumbles on, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an embarrassment to the fantasy genre and the anime fandom.\n\nAs mentioned previously, the world is set up like a tabletop RPG. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cgods\u00e2\u0080\u009d created this world from the bottom up, made the laws and rules, designed and created everything. Every piece on the board represents a character. The gods did this out of boredom, they play the game similar to the likes of D&D where they roll the dice to determine the fates of the people of this world. For some odd reason, GS is the only piece on the board that is able to negate their dice roll on him, effectively ignoring the laws and logic despite rolling a nat 1 himself. GS is a powerhouse walking Deus ex Machina while also being the pinnacle of a Marty-Stu, a character who constantly peaks at the script to have all the essential knowledge and sources to overcome any obstacle in his path. Even in times when the story makes his plot armour as thin as possible, there is no tension. The one time where viewers felt that there would finally be consequences was resolved by off-screen healing magic which required GS to sleep with a naked, underage virgin (Deus ex Machina) without previously mentioning such a spell.\n\nIf there is one thing Goblin Slayer executed \u00e2\u0080\u0098well\u00e2\u0080\u0099 was the amount of unnecessary fanservice. Every woman in this story is some sexy bombshell with gigantic funbags or a breathing kawaii anime troupe. Studio White Fox ended up adapting Kumo Kagyuu and Noburu Kannatsuki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s horrible manga and light novel. The animation was poor, a lot of recycled sequences, especially for GS and the goblins. Terrible use of CG on GS that reach the highest levels of cringe imaginable. Most of the blood and goblins themselves were CG. The character designs were unoriginal, basically ripping off characters from Fate Stay, Berserk and Sword Art Online. The score was weak, soundtracks cutting off abruptly during transitions and the seiyuus couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shine with the lacklustre script they had. There was even a recap after episode 10 which is very telling on how well White Fox really did, basically, they raise the white flag. Watching that recap would be recommended instead of viewing episodes 1-10 as you would not miss anything, and it would save you a lot of time.\n\nGoblin Slayer tries to make other factors feel important like legendary heroes, demons, dragons and all these things that are shown in snippets, much later in the series. When you see them, it honestly feels like you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching a completely different anime. There is a huge disconnect here since the story spends its time delving into one man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s struggle against this dreadful set of circumstances. Which means every other aspect of the show is a failure as it is not explored, they are not in service to the premise so they become nothing more than distractions\u00e2\u0080\u0094yet another sign of bad writing. This show has more problems, such as cinema narrative dissonance; the story being told visually does not agree with the story being told by the script. A perfect example is when the show finally attempts to explore the psychological trauma and PTSD of a victim of rape, which was completely ignored for most of the story. While the Sword-Maiden is telling her experience, the shot composition is dedicated to her bouncing tits and stiff nips. It is titillating, with various camera angles and lingering shots. And it happens twice, the second time having her also trying to seduce GS as she was portrayed as one of the shows many whores. Doesn't it occur to anyone that the atmosphere, the scenery and the fanservice are undermining the actual tone of what it's trying to tell you as the audience? \n\nIn summary, Goblin Slayer is worse than a poor mans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Berserk, in fact, it shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even be compared to it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a culmination of every poorly written fantasy rolled into one with high levels of exploitative sexual violence, used to shock the audience into thinking they are watching some mature and deep piece of media. The story (lack of it) and characters (who lack characterization) cannot hold together without GS. Remove him out of the picture and everything collapses. When you can imagine the cast of \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo Game No Life\u00e2\u0080\u009d doing the happy-go-lucky, slice-of-life elements that are in this show is when your suspension of disbelief has evaporated. It manages to insult your intelligence and also on a personal level with all its nonsensical gibberish. There is just no redeeming quality in this clusterfuck called Goblin Slayer, an abominable series whose legacy will be its controversial first episode, and won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be remembered by anything outside of it, which practically makes it a wet dream for edgelords."}, {"id": 3945, "score": 45, "body": "\u00e2\u0080\u009cWake Up, Girls!\u00e2\u0080\u009d (WUG) came out in 2014 without much fanfare. While it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t completely unknown to viewers at the time, it was definitely not a show that many paid attention to. Marred by poor production values and a plot that failed to really shine against its competitors, WUG never really managed to be a major player in the idol anime genre. \n\nBut nonetheless, it was a remarkable series in its own right. While more popular idol series like \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Idolm@ster\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cLove Live!\u00e2\u0080\u009d gave an idealized version of life as an idol, WUG always had a grounded approach in regards to how it represented its young idols. Life as a young star was not as glamourous as it seemed. It was a life filled with competition, stress, and bottom lines. Producers were not there to help their girls achieve their dreams. They were, for the most part, there to ensure that their stars were profitable and marketable. WUG\u00e2\u0080\u0099s willingness to show this side of the business stood out to me, which is why I have always been on the lookout for WUG-related media.\n\nSo how does the \u00e2\u0080\u009cWake Up, Girls! Shin Shou\u00e2\u0080\u009d (WUGSS) fare?\n\nNot too well.\n\nFirstly, I will admit that I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t head into this new season with very high expectations. People who have read my review on the last entry of the series, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBeyond the Bottom,\u00e2\u0080\u009d will note that I had a rather low opinion of the movie. In my opinion, none of the entries that followed the original series were able to capture the feeling that WUG had. And unfortunately, it appears that this series is no different.\n\nI have a fair share of issues with this season, which is why I am not surprised to see that the show has had such low scores on MyAnimeList.\n\nFirstly, I thought it was impossible for the animation for the WUG series to get any worse. As I mentioned before, WUG had a rather poor production values, which I was hoping would be fixed when WUGSS came around. For whatever reason, the new animation team has not only failed to improve the animation quality, but has managed to make the art shoddier than before. One prime example would be the dance and singing sequences which, unsurprisingly, are the crux of any musical idol series.\n\nRather than utilizing traditional animation for these sequences, we have been given CGI sequences that are ugly as hell. For those of you that have played mobile idol games like \u00e2\u0080\u009cIdolm@ster: Theater Days,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I am about to tell you that your mobile game boasts far better animation than this animation series. I understand that this may seem like I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m exaggerating, but the animation is so damn choppy for the CGI that I was beginning to worry that my monitor was beginning to lag.\n\nWhen you finally get to the fifth episode (assuming you last that long), you will begin to realize that the animation has devolved to the point that you are literally watching a glorified powerpoint. WUG has taken animation shortcuts before, but never on the scale of WUGSS, which has led me to believe that either the animation team was completely absent that day, or that they somehow ran out of budget and decided to take an Evangelion-esque approach to animation.\n\nIf I had to sum up the story, I would say that it is just alright. There are glimpses of the harsh idol industry that was so well-captured in WUG, but those moments are few and far inbetween. Perhaps there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more to the story, but at the time of this review, I have decided to drop this season at episode 5. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect the show to get any better in its remaining episodes. I would love to be proven wrong, but as of now, the show is not very good. If anyone reading this review would like to let me know if this show has gotten any better near the end, I would appreciate it if they send me a message sometime. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect much in any case.\n\nThe only real positive thing I have to say would be in regards to the music and voice-acting. As always, the musical talents from the real-life Wake Up, Girls! Have come to bless us again with their catchy and phenomenal tunes. Although not as great as WUG\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opening \u00e2\u0080\u009c7 Girls War,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009c7 Senses\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a decent opening song that lives up to its predecessors. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a shame that the opening animation is absolutely terrible.\n\nAll in all, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWake Up, Girls! Shin Shou\u00e2\u0080\u009d is an example of sequel that fails to improve upon itself. Its poor animation makes the original look like a masterpiece, while its mediocre and forgettable story prevents it from being anything but missed potential.\n\nI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even recommend this to the most dedicated of WUG fans. \n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d stick with the real-life Wake Up, Girls! if I were you."}, {"id": 3947, "score": 16, "body": "*SPOILERS FOR PHANTASY STAR ONLINE 2 THE ANIMATION. DON'T WATCH THIS ANIME. IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR TIME*\n\nAdvertising a game isn't the easiest thing in the world. Making an anime that is based on a game (whether it be an adaptation, a tie-in, or just something to promote the product in question) is even harder. Hell, the movie industry has had an exceptionally hard time trying to make a movie on these same grounds that actually worked well. That being said, you need to try to keep the spirit of the game you're promoting, as well as make something that can be a good gateway into the game series for people who probably wouldn't have bothered otherwise. With the exception of Visual Novels (they are only visual novels, not multi-genre games with a visual novel storyline), games have been notably hard to adapt right, if the likes of Blazblue Alter Memory are any indication. That brings us to today's target: Phantasy Star Online 2 The Animation. As you can see from both the MAL aggregate score and my score at the top right, this anime really didn't do a good job at anything. Now, why is that exactly? Not only that, but should it be declared as one of the worst anime of 2016? Well, let's find out, shall we?\n\nThe first few episodes don't really exhibit much of a major narrative. However, they have plenty of their own problems. The logic behind some of these characters' decisions is weak at best. Why is an average student like Itsuki immediately promoted to Vice-President of the student council right or the bat after joining? Apparently, it's because he has good attendance and his grades are decent (so, what's stopping the rest of these guys from taking up that role?). Why is the company behind PSO2 putting the student council in charge of testing out an already widely released and profitably sold video game that has already been released for seemingly a long time? Because...plot (but why not just enlist hardcore gamers and not a bunch of students that have to manage clubs). Why is Itsuki the handyman of clubs when he wasn't even in a club before the student council? I dunno; probably just so we can have a discount Shirou Emiya that doesn't even do Shirou Emiya things (but what's the point?). Why is the main relationship between our two MC's based around a game of fucking hide and seek? Because we need something to give our hero motivation (so why does this go nowhere?). The premise is kind of dumb as well: You can be conscious while playing the game IRL and you can actively communicate in the game in real time as if you're speaking normally. It gets genuinely confusing how this plays out. I'm not even gonna mention they condescending attempts at teaching us about things that their audience already knows (like conventions, trolls, etc) because we need to move on. One last though before the next paragraph; the first half of the series is riddled with horrendous forced drama moments that also tie in with condescending aesops and retarded character reasonings, so the story quality was horrible even before the main plot drags this all to hell.\n\nThe major plot (that really kicks off in the second half of the series) is that Darkers (weird aliens in PSO2) have somehow sprung from the game, through the screens of electronic gaming devices, to the real world. They don't even bother explaining how this works. We get a glimpse of this in episode 6, but t only becomes important in episode 7. We see this mysterious character named Aika who takes the game way too seriously, as if to foreshadow that there's more to the game than meets the eye. Still, what comes next is what truly makes this premise one of the stupidest in anime history: \n\nApparently, PSO2 isn't a game, but a world. This is all kinds of wrong. First off, how the hell did developers of PSO2 allow it to be a real world? If it existed beforehand, then that only complicates things so much further that it would be pointless to try (though, I would like to see one of you come up with every single way this theory makes no sense in a blog). Then again, part of the reason nothing about PSO2 makes any sense is that we know next to nothing about the game at all, with crucial information being relegated to eye-catcher commercial cards that play before and after a commercial for 3 seconds each! The handling of PSO2 causes a bigger pool of plotholes and questions than the Sword of Akasha from Code Geass R2, the combat systems in Mahouka, AND the combat systems in The Asterisk War! HOW DO YOU EVEN DO THAT?!?!\n\nThe other plot is the preparation and execution of the school festival. It's also full of forced drama, bad comedy, and the fact that it has to tie in with the main plot, which leads to even more moments of character idiocy and a generic \"hero must save the damsel in distress\" final climax (that has its own problems not worth delving into here). The ending is also pathetic as well. Apparently, Dark Falz (which wasn't mentioned previously) corrupts Itsuki's love interest, Rina Izumi, and some fights later, Itsuki, his friends, and his now saved love interest unleash a friendship speech so cheesy that Fairy Tail haters would almost want to apologize for any jokes made about that series' friendship speeches, and they literally rip off Fate/Zero Second Season's Excalibur scene to finish the bad guy \"for good\". In reality, it'll come back someday, but for now, we finish on a relationship going nowhere and the school festival finishing smoothly. The story is ridiculously bad, and it somehow manages to be one of the few that get literally everything wrong at every turn.\n\nThe characters do not fare much better in terms of writing. Itsuki is almost as bland as they come, with the two notable traits being how exceptionally awkward he is and how much easier he can be compared to his contemporaries (like Ritsuka from Fate/Grand Order: First Order). Still, he's hardly worth investing in. Izumi is worse. She is either a pathetically bland tsundere (luckily without the \"Baka\" or hurting the MC shtick) with a really lame connection to Itsuki, or an awkward mentor, depending on if she is IRL or playing as SORO. As SORO, she is extremely awkward in episode 1 with really confusing quirks that get abandoned immediately. Plus, when she switches into her original game persona, it's the same as IRL. Worse, she becomes a damsel in distress and really contributes nothing to the main plot. The school plot is where she has the most involvement, but she gets hijacked from that in episode 10 for...you know.\n\nIRL, Kouta is the bland and awkward \"classmate guy\" character. In the game, he is rather eccentric and flamboyant, making me wish he was like that IRL, since this cast needs more life. Aika...is weird. While her initial social oddities become explained in the fact that she is an NPC from PSO2 (which is part of the cesspool or plotholes and stuff surrounding their interpretation of PSO2), it can be embarrassing to sit through. Still, she had the most emotional stakes out of everyone. Too bad her personality is also weak, since she's the best-written character in the show. I'm not even gonna discuss the other logical problems involving her, because these side-characters (aka, the other Student Council members) have waited far too long for their beating.\n\nYukata flat out sucks. IRL, he is a wimp that nobody really understands until Itsuki does. In the game, he is an arrogant troll who dicks people over, somehow knows who Itsuki's avatar is IRL, and threatens to expose him for no reason. He is a pathetic troll who only exists for a condescending Aesop in episode 3, never to be relevant again until episode 11 for a lame ass \"your friends join you for the penultimate fight\" cliche battle, with a pathetically weak personality. Two of the student council members (whose names aren't even stated in the anime) have literally the exact same personality. They're beyond superfluous to any of the plots, and there is no reason for their existence other than badly done comedy. Then, there's Kudou, who starts off, like most of the other student council side-characters: generic asshole for the sake of being an asshole. He eventually shows off his eccentric and flamboyant side, but it was too late for him. Mika is aggravatingly douchey towards Itsuki because Izumi hangs out with him more than her. Her forced melodrama doesn't help her character at all.\n\nBarring Last Samurai and his wife, the PSO2 friends have little going for them as well, but they are, luckily, harmless. The only problem is that two of them are also never seen again after their debut until the penultimate battle (and they're not the last characters I'll say that about). In fact, barring the leader (Kasura, who is also generic), this applies to the NPC ARKs guardians as well, minus the pop idol whose singing I dislike. Thus, there isn't any time to make them remotely memorable, which is a shame as they have some potential to bounce off each other to work well in both combat and humor. Some of the students (namely the trio that constantly surrounds Aika) are aggravating to deal with at all times and add nothing but annoyance. Hell, three of the other students that were advertised in the OP are there for a quick moment, and are never seen again.\n\nNot only are most of these characters pathetically lame and poorly written, but the potentially interesting ones never get their chance to do anything, and some of the advertised ones have literally a few seconds of meaningless screen-time. The student council here is so bad that it makes the one in Mahouka look like it was comprised of actually great characters (albeit one of them is actually decent). Not a lot of these guys are actively heinous, but the ones that are, ruin the already mediocre and underutilized cast.\n\nIn the real life scenes, the art is passable and the character designs are mediocre. I still hate the occasionally badly blurred backgrounds, and their usage of lighting at times is horrendous (don't get me started on the one scene where there is bright and dark lighting for some reason, and the bright lighting is unbearably bright while the dark lighting is nigh-impossible to see anything in), but nothing deal-breaking here.\n\nHowever, the PSO2 game stuff is horrendous. The omnipresent CGI here ranges from eye-watering to eye-bleeding! The random monsters are revoltingly bad and the Darkers aren't that much better. The CGI avatars are hideous as well, with special mentions going to Silver (one of the PSO2 friends) and SORO. Hell, during an action scene, the CGI is so bad that it legitimately obliterates the frame rate, which is something that an anime should never be able to pull off on its own (especially on a properly supported platform like Crunchyroll). It makes the already horrible action scenes incomprehensible and impossible to follow properly. The actual action scenes are filled with putrid choreography and ass-pulls left and right (usually due to how we are told nothing about how anything in the game works). Yes, the character actions when CG break the frame rate as well, probably more than the Darkers and other random monsters at times. Plus, the actual avatars look awful by design. The excessive use of excessively bad CGI ruin he already mediocre art and turn it into a disaster-piece that would make art-critics vomit.\n\nThe art in episode 9 is definitely a step-up, with better CGI and character models, and no frame rate issues. The action is weak but better than before. Too bad that degrades after episode 10, because I was starting to believe that the animators actually were improving everything at that point. It's as if they said that the final battle needs to look as fugly as possible, and I won't mention how wrong the CGI dragon looks there or how badly they screwed up laser beams, because you need to actually see it for yourself.\n\nThe music is, you guessed it: lousy as well. The OP, Zessi Star Gate, by Shouta Aoi, is...odd. The first half is as awkward and lame as it gets. The second half, feels like it's desperately trying to be good, but misses the mark heavily at points. It makes it really weird to sit through. The ED, Rare Drop Koi Koi! One more!, by the two female members of the sad excuse for a love triangle (that Itsuki is a part of) is really bad, and when coupled with the horrid CGI footage and whatever SORO is doing, it becomes both infuriating and embarrassing to sit through. The OST in episode 1, is decent. However, it is horribly misplaced with everything, as if it was made for a more expressive and interesting show instead. That's why for episodes 2-10, the OST is pathetically generic and lame. Then they try some newer songs that also feel relatively out of place, even if there is one OK one that actually fits in episode 9 (as if to say that most of the effort and talent went to episode 9 while all the mediocre and bad sh*t went to the rest of the series). Honestly, nothing works, whether it be decent music that doesn't work with the anime or lame music that just fails to do anything.\n\nThe comedy is embarrassing and awkward. Almost none of the jokes work at any capacity. In fact, some of the earlier episodes feel extremely condescending, which really pisses me off. Your audience should never be talked down to, and the show doesn't get that. There's shoving morals in our face, and then there's doing it in a way that really insults our intelligence. The latter half of the show, while aggravating for how hideously had the plot becomes and how pathetic the finale is (the less we mention the Excalibur ripoff scene, the better), is borderline tolerable, if still tedious. At that point, the damage had already been done, and this barely even tried to redeem anything rib my experience with this abomination.\n\nIf you noticed --and you probably did--, I used the word \"awkward\" quite a lot. That's because the show is exactly that. Everything about this show, barring some condescending absurd moments, is awkward and uncomfortable to sit through. It was an endurance test through and through. There is hardly a single redeeming quality about this anime. The music is either decent but misplaced or mediocre, the art is mediocre, the CGI is on a whole other plane of bad, the fights are horrendous, the characters suck, the story is incomprehensible, and any good character with potential is incredibly underutilized. It's as if they wanted there to be as few redeeming qualities as possible. Either that or this was incompetently made. This doesn't cater to potential fans because we are told next to nothing about the game. This doesn't cater to existing players due to how bad the game looks in the ahem and how bad the story and characters are. Who does this even appeal to?! Well, that's enough rambling from me. I don't think this abomination can take it any longer and I've pretty much run out of things to say about it. Well, with that said, I bid you adieu."}, {"id": 3948, "score": 40, "body": "my first ever review so please be forgiving :)\n\nMy Sister My Writer is a standard harem anime about a normal boy whose little sister has written a light novel to profess her love to her big brother, but for reasons unknown she is unwilling to take credit and talks the protagonist into doing so, (i say unknown as everyone in the show seems to blindly accept that little sisters fall in love with big brothers as the norm). The light novel turns out to be a huge hit and the harem all fall for the protagonist in one way or another due to him being such an excellent writer\n\nnormally i would drop such crap quite quickly but on occasion i find the titillation anime genre quite funny, for example i really enjoyed High School DXD (although i wish they could have toned it down in the more serious parts) and this anime seemed like it was edging towards something more than pure fan service  in earlier episodes, throwing subtle hints that it wanted  to say something about the little sister genre, but sadly never seemed to manage more than a few nods of commentary such as the title of the light novel or a comment in an earlier episode about writing the second chapter  \"you don't need to add a new girl to push the story along\" (while blatantly doing the opposite in the anime) \n\nthe other issue with the anime seemed to be the opposite of high school DXD, not enough titillation, we would sometimes go 2 or 3 episodes with barely any \"panty shots\" or \"jiggling boobs\" making it again feel like it didnt know if it wanted to be a  fan service or a parody/commentary on the genre itself. while not understanding or willing to commit to either making the anime a total boring mess \n\noverall i wouldn't recommend this to anyone for any reason, Whether you like soft core anime, funny anime or anime that likes to push boundaries  The only reason i completed this is because its the Christmas holidays and i couldn't be bothered looking for anything else to watch \n\n\nif i was to recommend a titillation anime it would be How Not to Summon a Demon Lord, quite funny, lots of titillation while not being totally obscene                                                                                                "}, {"id": 3954, "score": 40, "body": "When you see the name \u00e2\u0080\u009cNobunaga\u00e2\u0080\u009d or anything similar to resembling Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legendary feudal lord in the title of an anime, it should come as a sign to keep low expectations. Normally these shows tend to be sub-par and lacking with\u00e2\u0080\u0094sometimes\u00e2\u0080\u0094cool action sequences and OST. On paper, the plot looks engrossing but unfortunately, it becomes another disappointing attempt to pay homage to one of the three unifiers of Japan. Adapted from Masato Hisa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s manga of the same name, Nobunagun is a sci-fi action series and visual delirium based on a Heroine with a gun and having the ability to draw power from the great Oda Nobunaga. It has an extremely difficult premise to understand.\n\nTrying to piece together a messy puzzle such as the premise is a bit of a headache since there are about five premises\u00e2\u0080\u0094not even kidding\u00e2\u0080\u0094in a free-for-all showdown for supremacy. But the dominant one revolves around our main protagonist and high-school girl, Shio Ogura, a closet military otaku with a strong fascination for tank machinery. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been having strange dreams about Oda Nobunaga. One day, Shio travels to Taiwan for a class trip. This is when the craziness happens, the fun is cut short when these insect-looking aliens called \u00e2\u0080\u009cEvolutionary Invasion Objects\u00e2\u0080\u009d start attacking all over the world\u00e2\u0080\u0094and when she manifests a massive gun out of thin air, she proceeds to go \u00e2\u0080\u009cRambo\u00e2\u0080\u009d on them. It turns out she won the genetic lottery and is an \"E-Gene\" holder, something that ties her to a past historical figure, in her case, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Nobunaga. Those that are possessors of this gene are able to draw special abilities from it, not only does she get a super-gun but his ferocious style in combat and even his high tactical skills in battle. We are given no logical explanation for how living people can come to possess this.\n\nIn addition, it completely forgets the absurdity and craziness of its own plot(s) and when it tries to have these unwarranted serious moments, you can feel dissonance in Nobanagun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tone\u00e2\u0080\u0094pampering in insufferable technobabble longer than welcomed. If only it had stuck to its guns of keeping things light-hearted, maintaining the absurdness to the plot and imaginative exaggeration, while simultaneously binding the personalities of the E-Gene holders to their namesakes as a way to centre the show around its characters\u00e2\u0080\u0094then it would have been decent, it could have worked with that. Unfortunately, it fails to do neither. And it makes the supporting cast feel lacklustre. Adam Muirhead whose is tied to the notorious serial killer, \"Jack the Ripper.\" He is a snide Brit whose powers manifest as a giant scythe. Mahesh Mirza a.k.a \"Mahatma Gandhi\" has giant hands that can be used as shields. You have other namesakes like \u00e2\u0080\u009cIsaac Newton\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cGalileo Galilei,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which all seem interesting on paper but the execution doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t carry that interest onto the screen.\n\nCould you imagine Gandhi actually watching Nobanagun? He would be far from pleased to find that his \"holder\" makes jokes about teenage girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cleavages. Newton would be rolling in his grave to discover he was reincarnated into a deviant, hypersexual lesbian. The E-Gene holders are recruited to a government agency \u00e2\u0080\u009cDOGOO\u00e2\u0080\u009d that trains them to prepare and fight the EIO. Shio learns to master her powers to mow down the aliens. The show continues to lay one digression after another\u00e2\u0080\u0094e.g., flashbacks into the past to show how the original E-Gene holders were all recruited into this war, and the duration of them are very small. And while the purpose is to give Nobanagun some depth and background, but so little of them reflects in Shio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and the other characters development, with the added issue of some altering history on these historical figures in the most ridiculous of ways. It just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mesh well when we have so many plots flying left, right and centre.\n\nIf you enjoy popcorn entertainment action, then you could find enjoyment in Nobanagun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s monster-of-the-week format, and then you do have Shio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s military strategy and tactics on the side but it lacks heart. The deeper you get into the series, the more you realize how shallow it is. Brimming with dull speeches, and pointless fighting makes for an unsatisfying experience because there is no resolution to the conflict or plot. Luckily for the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake, it's not a complete disaster, with the technicalities of Nobunagun having some shine time. At the very least, it looks good. Studio Bridge chose a glorious lurid colour scheme and experimented with the animation, artistic exaggerations that give it a trippy, hallucinatory flavour. The soundtrack reflects the balls-to-the-wall craziness in its action, very progressive in terms of tracks building up to the climactic moments, very energetic and sometimes violent. The OP \"Respect for the dead man\" by Pay money To my Pain is a very epic rock ballad that is complemented by creative visuals.\n\nIn summary, while it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s artistically appealing, there's not enough of that to make it into a story about its style, either. Nobanagun is a show that could have been about any number of other things, from being a thrilling and exciting beat-em-up or just a very fun, goofy action flick but, in the end, we have to settle for less for an anime with no sense of direction. As much as it is appreciated that a female character was given a lead role in a show like this and treated a lot better than most, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not enough to make up for most of the nonsensical content and poor comedy that seemed to relish in aspects of sexual harassment. While it aims for the skies, Nobanagun ends up shooting blanks."}, {"id": 3964, "score": 30, "body": "Every now and again there comes along something that leaves such little impact that you're bound to forget about it not long after hearing about it or watching it. Something so unremarkable that not long after finding out about it or finished consuming it, that years, months, weeks, or days later, you come across it swearing that you haven't heard of it despite the fact that you've already told people about your opinions on it or have marked it down that you've watched it. Haiyore! Nyaruko-san is one of those things.\n\nOur story follows Mahiro Yasaka, an ordinary student, until one day he is suddenly attacked by a dangerous monster while walking out in his neighborhood. Just when he is cornered in a dead end street and everything seems lost, he is saved by a silver-haired girl Nyaruko. This give claims to be the shape-shifting deity Nyarlathotep, from the pages of horror author H.P. Lovecraft Cthulhu Mythos, sent by the Space Defence Agency to Earth.\n\nAfter being rescued from the alien, Nyaruko falls madly in love with Mahiro and forces herself into his household, much to his annoyance. Soon, they are joined by two other deities, Cthuko, a girl obsessed with Nyaruko, and Hasuta, a young boy who is also obsessed with Miahiro (which comes across kinda creepy). Together, the three aliens protect Mahiro from various extraterrestrial dangers that threaten both his and the Earth's well-being, all while making his life a living hell.\n\nReading through the story synopsis, there were two things that popped out. One, it's the most cliched setup for one of the most cliched types of shows, a comedy harem show, and secondly, the fact that the Cthulhu mythology was chosen as the backdrop for this harem comedy. I think we all know why Cthulhu was chosen, because it's a recognisable name to draw in an audience, and because the gimmick of a Cthulhu harem comedy is the only thing holding this thing together. If the unspeakable gods from the pages of Lovecraft weren't here, someone looking for something to watch probably wouldn't have even given this a second glance.\n\nThere isn't all to much beyond the initial premise. Nyaruko chases after Mahiro, Mahiro rejects her. Rince and repeat until our main character inevitably has a crush on Nyaruko. As a harem comedy, it's incredibly generic. The only reason that anyone would want to watch this would be a unique spin on the Cthulhu mythos, and it doesn't really do anything unique with said concept. It doesn't really use stories that Lovecraft wrote to it's full potential of comedy. It doesn't even use some of the potential. It's just an excuse to have characters in a harem setting with the occasional wacky thing happening. It's the laziest type of adaptation, an excuse just to have recognizable characters on screen.\n\nIf you're going to have all of the Cthulhu gods in a comedy story, do something with it. Maybe make light of the Eldritch horrors in such way that the deities don't understand the horrors of the mind and reality warping they cause, or have everyone question why the main character suddenly has a harem only for one of the gods to turn everyone into half fish people like The Shadow Over Innsmouth, but make them look clumsy and terrible at their job. Instead, what we've got is bog standard harem comedy and references to other better things.\n\nAlso, the series has the audacity to try and have a montage of \"all the good times\" at the end despite the \"characters\" being so 1 dimensional and shallow that they're barely characters. If anything I'm easily going to forget about his 10 minutes after I upload this review and use that brain space to remember something actually interesting. Since the series barely has anything going for it, I would lump the OVA in with this review, but that also has nothing of substance either. It's just a brief parody of the\"Magical Girl\" genre.\n\nHaiyore! Nuarulo-san should be skipped over. It's bland, boring, and does nothing unexpected or anything that would differenciate itself from the dozens, if not hundreds of other harem comedies out there, both the ones that are genuinely trying to be regular harem comedies, and the ones that try to subvert the genre, have some sort of twist, or even a gimmick that tries to differenciate between itself and other harem comedies. I guess the one thing that this series did that was good was increse interest for Lovecraft's works in Japan when this aired on TV."}, {"id": 3965, "score": 5, "body": "~~~img500(https://i.imgur.com/381MPGk.jpg)~~~\n\n_Hi.

And frustrated.\n\nThis will be a slow burn as I gradually break it down entirely and again, ___I will end up spoiling the entire show if you still are considering actually watching it.___\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/m04HVmR.png)\n___\n\n#[Yoshitoshi ABe](https://anilist.co/staff/96991/Yoshitoshi-ABe)\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Return to Anime#\n\nHe's finally back!\n\n#[Serial Experiments Lain](https://anilist.co/anime/339/Serial-Experiments-Lain/)!#\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/AFIAR1r.jpg)\n#[NieA Under 7](https://anilist.co/anime/800/NieA-Under-7/)!#\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/uFqq7r1.jpg)\n#[Haibane Renmei](https://anilist.co/anime/387/Haibane-Renmei/)!#\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/MqJEjJo.jpg)\n#[Texhnolyze](https://anilist.co/anime/26/Texhnolyze/)!#\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/ibZzR6R.jpg)\n\n_Although only the character designs for Texhnolyze\u00e2\u0080\u00a6_\n\n#[Despera!](https://anilist.co/anime/6504/Despera/)#\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/CsF4aQW.jpg)\n\n...__Nope__, _just kidding!_\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/NrOsjC4.png)\n\nOver fifteen years and ABe has finally gotten involved in an anime again. \n\n#RErideD!#\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/TL0ePBv.jpg) \n\nProbably a bunch of people approached this show as a result of his involvement in it. I am most certainly one of those people. Certainly with what the show ended up being, you could immediately assume I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to be horrifically negative towards this series in this review as a direct result of being disappointed because I let myself think that this might be good because of ABe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s involvement.\n\nWell, no. I believe this series deserves everything I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m gonna give it. But more importantly I need to stress that even though ABe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s involvement was the primary reason why I watched this series in the first place\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 there really isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much ABe in this at all.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/136Crn1.png)\n\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like a handful of things apart from like what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the OP, ED, and the preview images for this that are in the actual show that seem to be from ABe. But other than that, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basically it. In an [interview with him](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2018-09-07/premiere-report-yoshitoshi-abe-rerided/.136451), he basically stated that he mostly just did designs for this series, and he would give his drafts to the actual character designer for the anime, and then they would do their designs and of course they ended up looking different. And that was basically the end of it because ABe figured they would end up in an endless loop of them exchanging drafts if he presented criticisms or suggestions beyond what he originally gave to the designer.\n\nABe also said he played a part in writing the screenplay and some of the story somewhere between when it was originally just going to be a straight adaptation of someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time travel novel to a full original series.\n\n...I really want to personally believe however, again, given what we were presented, that his involvement in that aspect of the show was as minimal as possible. \n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/NjdVK64.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/DGXr4V7.png)~~~\n___\n\n#A Worrying Start#\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/jUhyRiQ.png)\n\nThis show essentially went fully down the drain for me by the end of the very first episode. What followed was a Frankeinstein monster shambling about aimlessly, and I just had to watch until it reached the end of its journey\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 all while pondering why apparently nobody involved in its creation realized the mess they were shaping with their own two hands.\n\nThe first episode seemed simple enough when I first watched it but now having seen the whole thing and am rewatching it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I see now that the whole thing was rotten from the very start. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t some sudden or drastic turn. This was planned from the very beginning. And that is just so baffling to me.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/mveBjzD.png)\n\nLike it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supposed to feel like at the end of the show, everything is... wrapped up in a bow and satisfactorily concluded. They're making robots, but a bug happens and isn't fixed, and then ten years in the future the world is basically suffering a semi-robot apocalypse. But there's also time travel stuff, so let's go back into the past and... fix it! That's what this show is or should be but there's just... so much...\n\nIt's just handled so goddamned poorly. Like the only two episodes of the entire show that actually matter is the very first one and the last one. Almost everything in between is just nonsensical, basically filler, and bad action. Like the reason I put a full spoilers warning for this review in particular is because...\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/RxGiQEZ.png)\n\nThe way the main character Derrida fixes the semi-robot apocalypse which in turn was leading to a full on nuclear apocalypse is he goes back in time and says one thing different in a single conversation. And that alone completely prevents everything from happening.\n\nEvery single time he jumped to the past before the final one was completely and utterly meaningless. It honestly felt like \"okay, we're at twelve episodes, it's time to end the series.\"\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/6mpGvCf.png)\n\nMy mouth was literally agape. Because it would have been one thing if like the actual meat of the show which is Derrida struggling in the apocalyptic future with his companions was like a meaningful or entertaining adventure that they were undoing to save the world, but it wasn't.\n\nAnd it really gave the impression that they believed that it was. That the viewer would want to see where everybody would end up in the new future. You can't... like the reason I'm talking about the ending in the section that's supposed to be about the start of the show, is that like the very first minute of the entire series is actually of the fixed timeline... and then it switches over to the robot apocalypse timeline...\n\nGranted, you have absolutely no way of knowing that's what the start of the series is unless you go back to it after you finish watching it but... like that's actually the worst possible way I can imagine starting a time travel show.\n\nYou start the show after the problem solving retcon takes place, immediately go back to the timeline with the problem where the majority of the show takes place in, then the retcon happens that saves the day, and the timeline is fixed and the poor and vague start of the show actually finally makes sense.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/jmiQhCh.png)\n\nBut you know, we need to back away from that sort of stuff for now. We have ___way more___ important things to talk about first before we truly tackle the... embarrassing time travel.\n\n___\n\n#The Elephant in the Room#\n\nThe main antagonist of this series... well, one of them... or... okay, the guy who originally causes the semi-robot apocalypse in this series is none other than...\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/1d0U1LN.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/8YWdfcT.png)~~~\n\n...a poor and obvious caricature of the 45th president of the United States of America. \n\n#Donald J. Trump.#\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/k24rhun.png)\n\nNobody can watch this show and look at this character and say that's not what this character is. Like they didn't even try to mask it as anything else. That is 100% supposed to be Trump.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/opH3ppz.png)\n\nLet's not even go into how silly or lazy the idea of making your villain just be Donald Trump is. For that matter let's not even go into anything political about this ___at all.___ I swear to god I will steer the course of this review _straight into a goddamned iceberg_ before that happens.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/8G8sXQH.jpg)\n\nBut like... putting aside who he's based on entirely... he's just an evil business man! Like can we just retire that type of villain? Evil business man who is evil because he is a rich business man and he wants to make more money! Greed! Bad! I'm gonna fucking release robots with a bug that will just cause them to start going on rampages and just killing people because I fucking love _MONEY!_\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/ULEH5ue.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/l66uXg7.png)~~~\n\nOh no, there's like two of my scientists and they've found the bug and they want to patch it! Fuck that! How dare THEY! _I WANT A ROBOT APOCALYPSE SO I WILL HAVE ALL OF THE MONEY._\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/IppyZQP.png)\n\nWho even cares if this directly leads into a nuclear apocalypse because all of the major world powers just end up saying \"well oh shit there's evil murderous robots everywhere, I guess let's just solve it with nukes\", it doesn't matter as long as _I GET MY MONEY._ __BECAUSE THAT IS 100% MY ENTIRE MOTIVATION TO BE DOING THE THINGS I'M DOING.__ \n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/7CFzICs.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/xDIyLS2.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/26ittOH.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/NM0I9Q4.png)~~~\n\n...In truth, you know what fucking bothers me about this the most? He's like an actual serious antagonist in the first episode. You know if they had actually tried to keep that up throughout the whole show, sure. Fuck it, man. Trump causes the apocalypse. Fine. It'd still be super goddamned silly, but okay. Instead, every single scene he's in from episode one and on, he's just a complete fucking buffoon.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/z65Q9Qh.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/J2BmtSk.png)~~~\n\nIt almost feels like partway through they decided it was like a mistake and they wanted to back off. Like someone said \"alright no, this was a mistake, we gotta get rid of Trump\" because he eventually just stops appearing or mattering to the point where some brown hair guy becomes the main guy who's after and causing trouble for Derrida's group.\n\nAnd in the robot apocalypse timeline, Donald Trump just pointlessly gets killed by his own fucking mercenary who is just a complete batshit insane person for absolutely no reason. \n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/uRtXCqo.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/Q0K97FU.png)~~~ \n\nDonald Trump hired her to kill Derrida in the first place. There was like no moment motivating this. Like sure we the viewer have been shown that Rebuild's experiment is what screwed her up in the head. Like Donna already knew that the Yvains were her \"creators\" and Donald Trump was the head of Rebuild which \"created\" her so...\n\nWhy did she suddenly decide to kill Donald Trump other than because the show needed Donald Trump to die? Also, now that I think about it, Donna's rampage there is probably like the goriest scene of the entire show. \n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/19sMlbj.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/FYqsx2Z.png)~~~\n\nAnd it's the scene of the murder of the character who is a caricature of the actual current president of the United States of America.\n\nIn the fixed timeline, they just oust him for originally wanting to actively cause a robot apocalypse for money.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/9oukvpJ.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/dkUUQfu.png)~~~\n\nIf I were Donald Trump, I think I certainly would rather be in prison for wanting to bring about the complete global downfall of humanity rather than be brutally murdered by an actual insane person.\n\nimg(https://i.imgur.com/lXry3cM.jpg)\n\n_We've evaded the iceberg... for now._\n\n___\n\n#Bland Characters#\n\nYou know what's even worse than outright making your antagonist be Donald Trump?\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/EJSQQ1l.png)\n\nThe fact that he's basically the most interesting character of the entire show. Everybody else is just... either bad, or like they're about as generic as you can get. Like they're the characters you would expect there to be in a show like this.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/BwpZhiq.png)\n\nMain protagonist Derrida, he's the guy from the past who awakes in the robot apocalypse not knowing what has transpired in the past ten years. \n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/JtdiwIO.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/q5kvouF.png)~~~\n\nThere's Vidaux, the mercenary who just happens to cross paths with Derrida and saves him and acts as his guide and protector in this new harsh world he's awakened to. Also, he makes it a point that he won't help Derrida without being paid but guess what, Derrida has no money throughout the entire show and Vidaux helps him through the whole thing.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/26hjdjm.png)\n\nHe actively puts himself as well as his adopted daughter at risk numerous times for Derrida's sake based on a vague promise and the hope that Derrida isn't just some fucking insane person making all of this shit up.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/nBZ3nZN.png)\n\n\"Hey, Vidaux! I need you to be the action hero this series needs again! I'm just the time travel guy, I can't do anything about these killer robots! What? Oh, just put it on my tab again! Because you know, that's exactly how mercenaries work!!!\"\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/zaC1Zh1.png)\n\nSpeaking of Vidaux's adopted daughter, the entire purpose of her character in the show is that they couldn't just have the grizzled and rough mercenary. No, there had to be somebody with the mercenary that's a bit lighter, a bit friendlier, and is willing to talk with and be friendly to Derrida ~~until the reveal that Vidaux is actually the merc with a heart of gold because he's totally fine with doing all of this shit for Derrida for free.~~\n\nThen there's Yuri who is one of two girls that Derrida knew in his old life and her entire character is the camera. \n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/ir9Ujr8.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/ckiDUn1.png)~~~\n\nShe has a camera with her and she takes pictures. That's her character. \n\nDon't forget, you gotta have a bad mercenary for the good mercenary to fight! After all, Donald Trump isn't going to rely solely on the clunky and worthless killer robots to stop the good guys! He hired Donna! Who is totally just a cool badass evil mercenary character and there are no twists at all to her character!\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/QOn0bgf.png)\n\n~~There's a twist to her character.~~\n\nThen there's the stand-in antagonist who of course replaces Donald Trump after a while bizarrely because again, we have no fucking idea who this guy even is. I think at a point he's actually even given a name but I don't think we ever find out what his actual position is. Like is he from the government? Is he a subordinate of Donald Trump? Is he actually in a position above Donald Trump in the crazy killer robot company???\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/1BkOYnP.png)\n\nI have no fucking idea and I don't give this series enough credit to say I'm confident that I'd find out with a rewatch.\n\nAnd finally, the macguffin of the entire series, the second girl that Derrida knew in his old life. Mage. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/QrJLMYk.png)\n\nIn her ten years while Derrida was frozen, she lived throughout an entire version of this show herself. Wandering about the robot apocalypse while seeking the knowledge to perfect Derrida's time travel theory and put it to use and prevent the robot apocalypse from ever happening by preventing Derrida's death and instead somehow causing him to fall into a cryostasis chamber in a random cryostasis facility he just somehow wanders into. Then ten years later, he wakes up, follows Mage's path, time travels, and fixes the whole problem.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/1kWPcxK.png)\n\n...I would have rather seen Mage's journey! That seemed like it would have been way more interesting and entertaining to watch. Seeing her trying to perfect time travel and trying to go back and fix the problems herself but failing to do so because her memories of those times have already aged ten years. Like the entire show would be about her ten years being in the robot apocalypse rather than Derrida's... week? Actually, I don't even really know how much time was supposed to have passed during Derrida's journey of fucking around in the robot apocalypse.\n\nThen again, I guess it really doesn't matter!\n\nMage aside, they do actually try and give a backstory to Vidaux and his daughter but it's like the most generic shit that I don't think it's really even worth mentioning. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/1WCW6JY.png)\n\nLike Vidaux is really into being a cop and he's away from his family, his family gets murdered as an act of revenge against him I guess, he's prevented from being on the case because he's related, so he goes full rogue and murders the guy who did it but oh no, that guy just happened to have a baby and... it's... way too late into the show for any of it to even remotely matter.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/1eAnbGe.png)\n\nBut you know what? The evil mercenary is actually way worse than Vidaux. ~~I'm just going to skate entirely around the idea of how Vidaux just took the guy he killed's child and raised it as his own and he just got away with the murder because of the robot apocalypse... I wonder how Mayuka would react if she learned Vidaux murdered her actual father.~~\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/BBtEO5e.png)\n\nDonna used to be a researcher for the company that built the evil bad robots. On top of the evil bad robots, they were also trying to make robots that believed they were human and thought they had personality.\n\nI don't really think you should muddy the waters. You're already doing the killer out of control type of robots. Does this evil corporation really need to have robots that can infiltrate humanity disguised as other human beings? Do we really need to actively push towards a robot apocalypse this hard?\n\n\"Look! We made our robots practically completely indistinguishable to humanity! You better have your entire life savings wired to our company by tomorrow unless you want to be replaced by one of our robots! Your family will never know you're gone, and then we can flip the switch to turn the robot into the convenient KILL EVERYTHING AROUND IT mode we already had installed into all units.\"\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/BBtEO5e.png)\n\nAnd Donna was in fact one of the researchers for this experiment. Back then, she was named Angelica. But then the experiment robot began to apparently evolve on its own (???) and started making itself (I think it was the company just fucking with her actually) resemble Angelica more and more. And for some reason this supposed researcher somehow lets this robot talk her into what the robot is saying.\n\nThat Angelica is not Angelica. The robot is Angelica. Angelica is Donna. The former Angelica who is now Donna is a robot. The robot who is now Angelica is human, and she's the researcher in this experiment.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/yyPDYkl.png)\n\n...I really feel like they thought this was a super cool episode and character. But I was just completely fucking baffled in trying to make sense of it. Like she just basically lets a robot talk her out of her own fucking identity and humanity, completely fucking snaps, burns down the laboratory, and becomes Donald Trump's psuedo robot badass mercenary...? \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/V4IHZS8.png)\n\nAnd like she snaps a second time, kills Donald Trump, and goes after Derrida again but rather than because it's her target, it's because she resents him for creating her because she thinks she's a robot.\n\n...Like so much of this show just makes you want to throw your hands up in the air and say fuck it. It's not even worth it at this point, right?\n\nEven so, we continue on... \n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/EPPIT9A.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/oSIYp7n.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/6tN1gU0.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/5uR6nvl.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/NR5BUIk.png)~~~\n\nOh, by the way... I forgot a character.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/43BQi9A.png)\n\nThat's right. Graham the Car AI. Best character of RErideD hands down. ~~I will fight you.~~\n\nI MEAN, JUST THINK ABOUT IT. WHERE WOULD THEY BE WITHOUT HIM? YEAH THAT'S RIGHT. ___NOWHERE.___ WALKING THROUGH THE FAUX WASTELAND HITCHHIKING.\n\n...So of course he's one of the only characters throughout the entire show to actually die.\n\n___\n\n#Muddled and Terrible Writing#\n\nThe setting is a completely and utter fucking mess. And the writing is just generally unfathomably bad as well.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/HijFOTh.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/9DRF3NW.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/7Bn4Tjz.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/JHK7bqT.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/BZFpMa0.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/1X1S2gq.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/dnE3ru7.png)~~~\n\nSo hold on. A company builds robots and their robots go out of control on a massive scale destroying and killing whatever is around them. The government who paid this company... rather than taking action against them or even telling them to fix their dysfunctional products which are actively killing people... not only do they turn a blind eye to this because they don't want to shoulder their portion of blame for causing the robot apocalypse, but they continue to pay and fund this company...? Even several years into the robot apocalypse???\n\nHow is anyone supposed to rationalize that in their heads? THE ROBOTS THEY BUILT STARTED GOING ON RAMPAGES, AND THEY SOMEHOW BECAME THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST DEFENSE CONTRACTORS?\n\nWHAT--\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/MeeztmB.png)\n\n...I used up my one brain aneurysm per review too early. Shit.\n\nAnyways, when Derrida initially wakes up from being frozen for ten years, he's immediately tossed into some shit because he almost immediately encounters some of the killer robots. And we, the viewers, are immediately led to believe that \"oh okay, so the entire world is now full swing into a robot apocalypse and these things are everywhere.\"\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/Rz4kGVo.png)\n\nExcept, there's not. There's entire functioning cities and settlements that are completely okay and make it look like a robot apocalypse never even fucking happened. As a matter of fact, there is like an entire stretch of episodes where there's like no killer robots whatsoever. They start almost ENTIRELY appearing only when the plot really needs there to be killer robots.\n\n\"We gotta go through this old abandoned tunnel to sneak into--OH FUCK THERE'S SOME ROBOTS IN OUR WAY. DAMN IT.\"\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/OM3qpIq.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/sgooEr5.png)~~~\n\nBut you know despite how actual few killer robots are throughout the majority of the show, they just had to have an ENTIRE ARMY OF THEM in the very last episode. But hey, there being an entire concentration of killer robots somewhere explains why it seemed like there were so little of them anywhere else. It's because they all just happened to be hanging around where the Derrida would eventually end up needing to go to fix the apocalypse!!\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/rzfQtSO.png)\n\nHell, on top of this insane and massive army of killer robots, the brown hair guy stops by and lets like a new drone version of the killer robots loose and it's just complete and utter schlock because like Vidaux is just suddenly required to fight off an entire robot apocalypse __BY HIMSELF__.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/HGlEdM6.png)\n\nAnd you know what? This lone man who stayed behind so his friends could go on, therefore sacrificing himself... against all odds against an entire army of the evil robots...\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/k1iA6nf.png)\n\n...is fucking WINNING. Even by the point of Derrida jumping back into time to finally fix the robot apocalypse, _VIDAUX IS STILL ALIVE. HE DIDN'T EVEN SACRIFICE HIMSELF, HE'S JUST STILL FIGHTING. HELL, HIS DAUGHTER ACTUALLY WENT BACK TO BE WITH HIM IN THE LAST MOMENTS BEFORE THE COUNTRY GETS NUKED/THE TIMELINE IS FIXED._\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/5hcAFVC.png)\n\nLike these robots are so bad they have to time travel rather than use the stupid patch file they also still have in the robot apocalypse timeline, but they can't even kill one cop gone mercenary? There's like a billion of them and even the new ones that can fly, but it's just not enough. But weren't these robots being sold for combat purposes as well? And yet they can't kill one person whose role in the script for the final episode could have just been summed up in two words: ___HEROIC SACRIFICE.___\n\nIt becomes even worse when you add in the fact that the country is bombing itself. \n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/WByTQnt.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/U7dnTl4.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/93A6zSu.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/HqL2K4P.png)~~~\n\nLike the solution they've come to ten years into the robot apocalypse is to just bomb entire communities and stretches of land indiscriminately and randomly. What in the possible fuck is that going to solve. The company that caused all of this nonsense __STILL EXISTS AND IS FUNCTIONING. THE GOVERNMENT IS STILL GIVING THEM FUNDING.__\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/V9wU2r8.png)\n\nIn this universe, does nobody have a functioning brain? Randomly bombing your own country isn't going to solve anything! It's just gonna raise the death toll! And the other countries I guess apparently bought this company's robots too and they're fucked so in the final episode I guess everybody just collectively agrees to throw in the towel and push the big red button.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/PobRIjS.png)\n\nIf we all decide to launch our nukes at the same exact time, we won't have to worry about the robots anymore! And like in the actual show, the fucking brown hair antagonist is saying something along the lines of:\n\n\"YO, DERRIDA. STOP BEING A FUCKING PANSY AND COME WITH US SO WE CAN LITERALLY WATCH THE WORLD BURN IN ATOMIC FIRE.\"\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/Q53aFs2.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/f8J9lnI.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/W6IcAo2.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/AYeC4fF.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/qOi3yQS.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/ETZ3Gfv.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/8XNkK2S.png)~~~\n\n...I really wish I hadn't read that interview and learned that ABe apparently was involved at least partially at point in the story and writing of this series. Like I really wish I did not learn that knowledge. Maybe he was only involved in the writing when it was still supposed to be an adaptation of whatever time travel novel. I'm gonna force myself to make myself believe that.\n\n...Like it's honestly astonishing that as I go look back through it all, I keep on finding more stuff. When Derrida first wakes up and meets Vidaux and Mayuka, they have like a device to check for a chip or something that apparently all the survivors in the robot apocalypse have to identify them by.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/nbzutVF.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/W4Ufo82.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/j5dkPTe.png)~~~\n\nIt happens so quickly and it's never brought up again so I forgot about this, but... the sole purpose of this moment is so Vidaux and Mayuka will actually believe that Derrida isn't some insane person lying about being asleep for ten years in a pod. Just think about it. Survivor IDs...???\n\nSo like you survive the robot apocalypse, but your family doesn't. Your family's dead. You turn to the government hoping that they'll either offer you reparations for your loss which they are more or less directly responsible for or at the very least, that they'll do something about these fucking robots that killed your family.\n\nInstead, they look at you and say, \"okay, you survived? Please step into that line so we can insert a chip into your arm so we can easily identify you as a person who survived this ordeal.\"\n\nLike did they just not think about any of this? I just don't... understand...\n\n___\n\n#The Time Travel#\n\nFinally, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at the meat of the series. The robots _never_ were the focus of this show. From the very beginning, it was the time travel.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/q7O7RB8.png)\n\nSo that brings us to the grand question\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 how does the time travel exactly work?\n\nWell unfortunately before we even open that gigantic bag of worms, we have to discuss how Derrida ends up in the future in the first place. The first episode ends with Derrida fleeing through a forest as Donald Trump wants him dead so nobody knows about the impending robot apocalypse he wishes to throw the country into.\n\nAnd then as he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s running through the woods, he ends up falling into a random cryostasis facility? \n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/8FcuEEs.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/DTW7BvQ.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/y6ofsSx.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/80KDiGC.png)~~~\n\nHe stumbles around and then ends up sitting in a cryostasis pod which immediately activated upon him sitting down into it. That is a fucking huge design flaw.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/WHMu3F4.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/lHWEsaS.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/EeV2hCA.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/zxSadlb.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/J6zCJPS.png)~~~\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revealed at the end of the show that when Mage already used her time traveling once at this point to go back and somehow prevent Derrida from being killed by Donald Trump. But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re shown that the time rides are basically you go back in time to an important memory and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re basically that version of yourself again at that point of time.\n\nBut Mage was nowhere near there. At that point in time, she was in the hospital because she tried a time travel experiment and collapsed as a result of it. Yet she somehow went back in time and caused Derrida to fall into a random cryostasis facility\u00e2\u0080\u00a6? The cryostasis facility is literally never fucking explained. Why is it there, who built it, how is it still functioning when it looked entirely abandoned\u00e2\u0080\u00a6? There are so many questions and so many of them are never answered.\n\nI mean, I guess it just comes down to\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe need the protagonist to jump ten years into the future so THAT\u00e2\u0080\u0099S why a cryostasis facility is there and he just happened to fall into it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut anyway\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the time rides. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/vBcmNyM.png)\n\nThey just start happening at a point in the show completely randomly. At the time, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually full on going into the past. Like his head starts hurting and smoke just appears and bam he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the past. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s later revealed that this is apparently triggered by meaningful or powerful memories, and Derrida basically realizes that all that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really needed to time travel is to just think really hard.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/KbOnYg4.png)\n\nIf you think about time traveling super hard, you will time travel. Because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how time travel works. Because nobody ever thought of trying that. Like oh, I built this super fucking complex time travel machine, took years to make, but oh okay, what I really needed to do was to BELIEVE that I could time travel.\n\nBut oh hey, it does turn out that you do need time travel equipment to actually do time rides. Yet, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty weird, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it? How come Derrida can just fucking randomly waltz into the past while they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re out doing other shit if he actually needs equipment? Well you see... that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because Mage is actually in a pod somewhere with the time travel stuff Derrida needed...\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/E4tmdiJ.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/nqq7dHy.png)~~~\n\n...and she worked it to where the time travel equipment was linked to the watch Derrida gave to her as a birthday present ten years ago which she left for him on his cryostasis pod at the very beginning of the show and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/DkoIgG2.png)\n\n...How\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 how does this work exactly? Like apparently when you time ride, it eats your memories as fuel (???) the more you do it. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/OaYy4tm.png)\n\nAlso, the young time travel magic version of Mage says that you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t apparently time ride to the same moment twice. So almost all of Derrida\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time rides are to completely random points and he is always unable to make any meaningful change. \n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/5XWKKG2.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/As2A7jH.png)~~~\n\nSo while he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing all of this worthless time traveling that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t solve anything, Mage is in a pod somewhere losing her memories because Derrida is unknowingly using them for fuel\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/eqCKiAT.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/Yup6LBm.png)~~~\n\nIt genuinely almost feels like they were aware of\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 you know, when you do a time travel thing, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always gonna be that one guy who stands up and goes:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah, but uh, if they fixed the problem they went back in time to fix, then wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they not go back into the past in the first place because the problem would be fixed in the future? Paradox!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo they just said fuck it, and made it as nonsensical as possible as if challenging those people to try and make sense of any of this. Like one of Derrida\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time rides, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even remember what it was he actually went back in time and changed, but it for no reason undid Yuri breaking her camera which survived ten years into the robot apocalypse yet broke when she fell one time.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/FtejAay.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/li0076L.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/uXdZP4k.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/idlqIJ9.png)~~~\n\n*Yeah, okay. The camera has survived ten entire years including a robot apocalypse, but it breaks immediately when she falls ONCE.*\n\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no real link to whatever Derrida did differently in the past to Yuri breaking her camera. And if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like the \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you change something in the past, the entire future is different\u00e2\u0080\u009d idea, then why is the camera being broken the ONLY thing that is different?\n\nAnd you know what, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually one of his most impactful time rides. He saved Yuri\u00e2\u0080\u0099s camera. Good thing he did too, because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s her entire character!\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/iO3hpvp.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/4eriRMf.png)~~~\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDERRIDA. MY CAMERA IS BROKEN. THIS ENTIRE TIMELINE IS DOOMED, GO BACK IN TIME AND FIX IT.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n___\n\n#The Ending#\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/6k1cFla.png)\n\nThe ending of this show or rather the final time ride Derrida makes was a fucking slap to the face. Because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at this point that is very bluntly revealed that pretty much nothing mattered. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like all those random time rides he made in the past like eventually added up and he cleverly prevented Donald Trump from ushering in the robot apocalypse.\n\nNo, they find Mage, and he time rides back into episode one and specifically at the point where Derrida told young Mage that time travel was impossible and he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to continue that research. He tells Mage that he will continue researching time travel, and that appeases Mage and she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t proceed to do the experiment that sends her to a hospital, and from that, eventually, it leads to Donald Trump being ousted for the clever and evil villain he is.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/iPwqdKn.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/tRemoGW.png)~~~\n\n...One conversation prevented the entire apocalypse, and it was Derrida swearing that he wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give up on researching time travel. Not only does it undo the apocalypse, but the new future is actually 100% perfect. Vidaux is still a cop and his wife wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t murdered, Mayuka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (Vidaux\u00e2\u0080\u0099s adopted daughter) parents are apparently somehow a happy couple, Yuri\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing her photography, Angelica/Donna isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a fucking insane person, Mage and Derrida are apparently together (???), and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and this is the bow on top\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/Ft6QhIl.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/53kpySe.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/TL9ZKy1.png)~~~\n\n...the AI of Vidaux and Mayuka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talking car who at the end of the robot apocalypse timeline heroically sacrifices himself by launching himself into the secondary bad guy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s airship and self-detonating in it is reborn in this new future as a small friendly happy robot.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/xAHLOD9.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/Deep4lv.png)~~~\n\n___EVEN THE MOTHERFUCKING CAR GETS A HAPPY ENDING.___\n\n...It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just embarrassing. Like this ending that is happy for all of the characters (well I guess except for Yuri since she loved Derrida too\u00e2\u0080\u00a6)  feels just completely undeserved.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/UeANvMg.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/MOpk5Kf.png)~~~\n\nYes, I know it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a time travel thing and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plenty of things where the catastrophe or whatever is prevented and therefore a bunch of stuff is just made to have never happened at all, but the key is that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\nThe time travel/journey has to be either entertaining or meaningful. There has to be weight to the characters if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m supposed to care about one of them in tears swearing that they wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forget the journey that led to the time travel that would retcon pretty much everything. But again the show was aimless, bad, and at its worst, boring and dull as all hell.\n\nSo I just sighed at the ending. Suddenly, it was just over as quickly as it had began. And for that, I am genuinely thankful.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/M1kjhxp.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/vgHivM5.png)~~~\n\n___\n\n#Conclusion#\n\nWith terrible writing and horrifically bland/undeveloped characters, really the only hope there was for this was if the action scenes were really good. But they're not. They're a mix of CG car, terrible sound effects, and explosions. And the story is just after eleven episodes of wandering aimlessly in a vaguely dystopian future, they manage to fix time and Donald Trump is stopped with no consequences at all whatsoever.\n\n~~Not to sink even further into time travel shenanigans, but the ending is actually complete bullshit anyways because how in the fuck would Derrida's change actually result in some of the differences shown? Like the whole thing with Vidaux and Mayuka happened before the robot apocalypse. Yet Derrida prevented the robot apocalypse so that meant Mayuka's parents were somehow happy together and her father didn't kill Vidaux's wife...? Again, the only explanation you can really go with is \"change one thing in the past and dozens of things will change\" but that's just fucking lazy.~~\n\nAbsolutely nothing is lost and everybody but Donald Trump and the evil people supporting him get a happy ending. The happy ending is not there because the characters earned it through struggling or fixing the problem with time travel CLEVERLY. The happy ending is there because it _SHOULD_ be there. It _NEEDS_ to be there.\n\n...So, in conclusion, my opinion of this show is that... maybe they should have stuck with the original plan of making an adaptation of an actual time travel novel. Perhaps this disaster maybe would have been averted if they had. All I know is if I was Yoshitoshi ABe and I was shown the final result, I would have asked to have my name stricken from the project entirely.\n\nA __5 out of 100__.\n\n~~~img500(https://i.imgur.com/Hxpr6z6.png)~~~\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...You know what, this isn't right. \n\nThis long of a review... for this? No. I can't get my time writing this review or watching this series back, but maybe I can warn others to just not bother whatsoever! Time travel will fix the problem as it fixes all problems as this show has taught me!\n\nAnd all I need to do is think really really hard and I will go back in time!\n\n~~~[Let's go!](https://anilist.co/review/3965)~~~\n\n~~~img500(https://i.imgur.com/381MPGk.jpg)~~~\n"}, {"id": 3988, "score": 30, "body": "Emulating the gratuitously pompous and cheeky style of the eponymous main character, I'll go right out and say that this manga is lame as fuck.\n\nContinuing with said style, to add some vague and vapid criticism so that people will believe I actually have something of value to say and am not just throwing a trite analysis around to sound smart, the main problem with this manga is that it abuses our suspension of disbelief to a point it becomes not only annoying but borderline ludicrous. It's like reading an impression of the literary establishment through the lens of a complete outsider, who never before set foot on the endeavour of writing a novel. And, considering this manga commits about every mistake a novel should avoid, that is not surprising.\n\nNow to the actual review: the problem starts right away with the main character. Mind you, she's not only a very capable writer who can very well face up to some of the best of her generation, no: she's this kind of unbelievable, unearthly talent who's incapable of committing a mistake and leaves anyone who reads her words utterly flabbergasted. At the beginning, the editor did point out that her style was rough, but that little fact was just ignored through the story to universal appraisal. Nevermind that even the greatest novels of all time all have flaws and are not continuously great, and some didn't even impress critics when they were first published and only found acclaim years later: this 14yo girl has just produced a flawless work. Really, how hard is it to tone down your character to a believable level, especially when writing an artist of a field the author clearly has no experience with?\n\nThe manga claims that Hibiki's novel \"views on life and death\" (whatever that means) and hazy nostalgic feelings are what makes it special, however we are never given any kind of reason to believe there's anything remotely special about the way Hibiki thinks or see the world or about herself, because all she ever does is act like a complete asshole and an overaggressive bitch who should probably be put into a restraining jacket. It's like the author's impression of how a \"true\" author should act like came right off a WWE special. She also claims to read a novel a day like that's supposed to be impressive, which makes me think the author completely missed the point of reading. \n\nThe thing is, she's a boring as hell character. It's no wonder the only reason people around her find her interesting is the same reason they would amuse themselves by seeing russian car crashes on YouTube. She's basically an on/off switch character with no relevant personality; only the off part is slightly broken, since she's either wreaking havoc or being less but not totally not-an-ass all the time.\n\nThe problem with a lot of manga authors is that they deem enough to tell rather than show. In this manga, we are constantly told how amazing Hibiki is, but we are never shown any reason to really buy any of that, especially since we are not ever given a word of what she actually wrote (because that certainly would be the final blow to our suspension of disbelief). If anything, all we are shown is that she's unstable as hell and should seek professional help.\n\nActually, character is mostly absent here. Rika is the only character who's any close to interesting or can convince us she's a decent writer, and even then she's just reaching average. Her novel idea is actually pretty evocative, rather than the dull and vague \"life and death\" that we get about Hibiki's. To be fair, only the two of them plus the editor have any relevance at all in the story. There's another guy whose whole deal is being a massive creep, but it has been 37 chapters and we still have no idea what relevance he has to the story.\n\nThe art is terrible. Not much to say about it, anyone can see that. And even then, for some reason, the author thought it a brilliant idea to give every female but Hibiki a cleavage so sumptuous it completely disrupts any attempt at anatomy. It's like seeing the drawings at the back cover of a 13yo's notebook.\n\nThe manga also adheres to the \"deal with it, wimp\" philosophy of some seinen manga, but different from Asano's harsh realities, all it accomplishes is being artificial and, at most, cute. It's almost offensive seeing that flat (in both senses, if you may) 14yo girl who acts like your usual and annoying rebellious teenager teaching adults how to live life. If anything, Hibiki is _that_ kind of person whom life has never teached any valuable lesson.\n\nReally, what makes me the most surprised is that this manga actually won an award. "}, {"id": 3989, "score": 45, "body": "Cardcaptor Sakura is one of my favorite anime of all time. It has an unbelievably charming cast of characters and really fun and creative monster of the week battles that serve to help those characters grow more than just for action\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bright, poppy, and consistently fun show and watching the cast grow over time is really fulfilling, and it culminates in one of my favorite closing scenes of any anime. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very conclusive story, but also a very nostalgic show, so I guess if the manga continues, why not adapt that to anime 20 years after the original? Cardcaptor Sakura Clear Card-hen is not good. Not only does it fail miserably as a sequel to an excellent show, it also fails as a standalone piece. \n\nI had always said that I love the characters in Cardcaptor Sakura enough to want to watch them do literally anything for 70 more episodes, so what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my problem with Clear Card? Well, naturally, its biggest flaw is with the characters themselves. The diverse, quirky cast has been reduced to basically memes of themselves that show up only for the sake of nostalgia. \n\nSyaoran is no longer the sassy yet taciturn and emotionally closed off guy he was in the past, but a completely hollow hunk that shows up to be nothing more than Sakura\u00e2\u0080\u0099s love interest (and this romance is not even elaborated on in an interesting way throughout the 22 episodes, though the romance was a bit overdrawn in the original show as well). Tomoyo just shows up to say \u00e2\u0080\u009chey look! Drones! Webcams! Cardcaptor Sakura\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still cool with the millennials right?! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m gay!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and her former charm has been almost completely reduced to the meme. Touya and Yukito/Yue show up sometimes, but are pushed wayyy to the side. Which is fine, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not the focus, but man the voice acting performances on these two are just not all there, both Tomokazu Seki and Megumi Ogata sound like they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re about ready to pass out 90% of the time (which is a shame, because the latter is my favorite seiyuu). \n\nSo I guess naturally, with less than a third of the length of the original show, it is expected to put the cast to the side a bit to focus on the characters that really matter in the narrative, but man...it just makes for a really dull show. The main characters in play here are Sakura and Akiho. I think Sakura stays truest to her original character, still very charming and full of personality (and Sakura Tange should have more voice acting roles, just as a side note). Akiho on the other hand is a completely unnecessary addition to the cast. I mean, she definitely upholds a baseline level of pleasantness and positive emotions and clearly has some major connection to the main plot throughout the show, but does that make an...interesting or detailed character? Especially given how much time is focused on her (and when most of the interactions are just \u00e2\u0080\u009clook Akiho this is a thing!\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cwow, this is a thing that is new to me! How lovely!\u00e2\u0080\u009d). Given how dynamic and full of personality the rest of the characters in this show are, the fact that so much focus is put on her and she still doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even have half that level of charm or detail is just really obnoxious. (and uh Kaito is there too I guess, to be basically very overt mystery character in the vein of Erriol, who I also never really cared for).\n\nThe action scenes and card fights stay pretty consistent throughout, I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really say they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re any better or worse than the original show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, though those weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really the draw for me in the first place, it was more the events that would happen during the fight that mattered. Every fight has a point in the original show, and the context around it is what makes it so fun to watch. I uh didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really get that quite as much from this show, the card fights felt more like an obligation as a monster of the week show than serving any purpose to develop the characters. \n\nThe core mystery about the cards turning clear isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t uninteresting, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fine arc, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d put it on the same level as the later arcs of the original show. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just handled so messily, they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even really get into solving it until the last couple episodes, and then it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just tied up with a really messy bow to give some sense of closure without even touching on many of the points that were touched on for the greater part of the show (cause lord knows we needed an entire episode of Sakura reading a fucking book to kids). I know this is an adaptation of an ongoing manga so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to be expected, but if there's nothing close to a conclusion at the ready, why even bother?\n\nOn a production level, the show is good. The modernized designs are nice to see, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well animated, the card designs are cool (the labyrinth card in episode 10 was especially cool, definitely stands out in my mind). While I do prefer the more colorful, 90s aesthetic of the original personally, I have no gripes about this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appearance. Returning many of the old voice actors leads to mixed results, but I think it's a net positive, same for reusing parts of the original soundtrack.\n\nNow, I know it seems like I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m spending a lot of time comparing Clear Card to its predecessor, but is it not unfair to criticize the show itself of the same thing? I think anime reboots are find and usually pretty tasteful, but the amount of nostalgia jerking off here was just obnoxious. Remember lying guy? What if he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just in literally every school scene doing his gimmick and Sakura and Li believing him way more than in the original, that won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get old will it? Remember when Tomoyo was gay for Sakura in a way that would be believable for a 9 year old girl? Nah, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just the big gay now because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s funny. Remember Spinel he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually a cool gamer dude that facecams with Kero now! \n\nHell, even Syaoran being here comes across like that to me, his arc was so well done and ended so neatly in the original show, and his departure at the airport and subsequent brief return in the second film to tie up loose ends is so heartfelt and conclusive. But nah fuck that, we need another season of Cardcaptor Sakura, bring him back to the school, pull together some bullshit reason to justify that. And then...he doesn't even really contribute anything outside of to have Sakura constantly reaffirm her love.\n\nLook, just because something in the original show was good does not justify bringing it back just to touch the same feels as it did originally, especially when there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing to be gained from it. It just comes across as desperate to me. Why not, instead of focusing on the past, develop a new cast and put some energy into developing characters that are just as likable as the original?\n\nAnd all that being said, I can not visualize this show functioning as a standalone piece all that well. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so much callback to the original that would be lost without context. Add to the fact that the original story _was) finished...the characters have already grown in the way they were intended and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so little development here that it just comes across as flat. I do think it has a baseline level of pleasantness and charm that keeps it watchable, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still just so little actually going on and being effectively executed that it is just not worth being added.\n\nSo in conclusion, Clear Card is just a flop. While fine on a technical level and still maintaining a level of charm, it is just a sequel we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to a story that ended neatly. It misuses great characters, clings too closely to the original without much new to offer, and ultimately raises more questions than it answers. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just the definition of unnecessary.\n"}, {"id": 3993, "score": 20, "body": "_Disclaimer: I am not familiar at all with the source material for this show so I don't know if my criticisms of the work are more appropriate for the author or the director.

Do not recommend."}, {"id": 4024, "score": 45, "body": "_This review contains major spoilers, read at your own risk_\n\n\nI originally started watching Bunny Girl out of the recommendation of a friend, who said I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d probably really enjoy it. I had already heard high praise for the show before, but something about it made me feel suspicious. Maybe it was because my only exposure to it were screenshots of its protagonist acting perverted. Maybe it was something else. But I was very cynical at the start.\n\nAnd now that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve watched through all 13 episodes of this story, have my opinions changed at all? Yes, but not really. Kinda.\n\nBunny Girl is not a very good show, I should get that out of the way. But something about its badness seems to captivate me, and I want to get to the bottom of why. So this review is my attempt of figuring it out.\n\nFirstly, though, I should mention what I liked about Bunny Girl. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a well-produced show, and it looks very pretty. I greatly enjoyed the soundtrack, and I loved the atmosphere. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also pretty laid back, it never really screams at you. The voice-acting was stellar, too: there were some particularly hard scenes that were very well-performed. And the OP and ED are incredibly catchy, too. So you could say that it had a lot of effort put in it. However, where it truly fails is in its story.\n\nBunny Girl is the story of Sakuta Azusagawa, a loner high-school kid who helps girls that are going through seemingly supernatural phenomenons. That description might remind you of a different show, the Monogatari Series, but there are some key differences.\n\nMonogatari had a large focus on personal themes. The stories often deal with feelings of jealousy, trauma, and love, but it concerns itself very little with the outside world. In fact, you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as much as see pedestrians or passersby in an episode of Bakemonogatari.\n\nBunny Girl, however, has higher aims than that. While it does have its fair share of personal drama, it also wants to talk about our dang society. Its observations are shallow, though, and right by episode 3 I could already see the problems I would have with this show. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pure feelings of teenage angst, with no real nuance: Azusagawa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s monologue at the end of the episode felt more like a teen ranting about how he \u00e2\u0080\u009cdoesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care what others think\u00e2\u0080\u009d rather than a thought-out philosophical statement.\n\nWhich brings me to this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest problem, the source of my fascination, a stumbling block that brings the whole thing down with it: A thoroughly unlikeable protagonist.\n\nNow, I should clarify: there is nothing inherently wrong with an unlikable protagonist - Re:Zero, for example, did it just fine. But your protagonist has to grow as a person, he has to realize what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing wrong and try to improve, his ideology, at some point, must be stumped. Simply put, he needs to eat shit.\n\nAnd Azusagawa NEVER eats shit.\n\nIn fact, he seems to be constantly rewarded for his worst behaviour. In fact, the world revolves around this one boy!\n\nWhen he is unreasonably rude or incredibly nosy, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always justified, because he was right all along. When he is a pervert, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s okay, all the girls he comes by are just mildly uncomfortable, it even trips them up a little. Whenever he does something that could be conceived as bad, the show tells us \u00e2\u0080\u009cRelax! He was under control of the situation all along! He actually needed to be a dick!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSeveral times throughout the story, Azusagawa will make a remark, and a girl will respond that he was very logical.     If a girl ever slaps him or insults him, or simply tells him off for something he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d done, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come back a few minutes later to say that she was wrong, he was right, an that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very sorry. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pretty sure the entire cast has called him \u00e2\u0080\u009cunfair\u00e2\u0080\u009d for being soooo, soo nice. They always cave in to Azusagawa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opinions every single time.\n\nConsequently, none of the girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emotional arcs can be very compelling. They never solve their problems through introspection or self-reflection, but through our protagonist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words. He is not there to lead them to the correct answer, but to tell them what the correct answer is. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re essentially treated like babies by the plot, damsels in distress just waiting for Azusagawa to come save them, rather than real human beings. There are two different moments in the story where a girl is going through some emotional turmoil, and it happens completely off-screen while our protagonist tries to find her.\n\nThis has another bad consequence: nobody, and I do mean NOBODY in the story ever steals the protagonist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spotlight. NOBODY gets the upper hand on him. NOBODY can even trip him up intentionally! The scene is always his!\n\nAnd this is Bunny Girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other major difference from the Monogatari Series. Say what you want about Araragi as a protagonist, but he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a god. He slipped up. He made mistakes. He didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always have the upper hand. And he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t save the girls by the sole strength of his own wit, but rather led them the right way so that they could find the answer themselves. And this helped the rest of the cast shine, made them feel like real people. Monogatari isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t perfect, but it knows how to be compelling, and this show could do well to learn from that.\n\nHowever, as much as I complained about Bunny Girl, it did get better over time. It never truly became good, but as the story stopped trying to make observations about  society, and as the writers seemingly forgot that their protagonist is a bit of an asshole, it went from bad to bearable. Right at the very end, though, the show reminded me of all its worst aspects.\n\nIn the final episode of Bunny Girl, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revealed that Shouko, the only person who ever had to support Azusagawa during hard times, is a creation of his subconscious. Even when he needs help, he gets it from himself.\n\nAnd our protagonist deserves none of his rewards. His ideology is one of apathy, of just \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot caring what people think, man!,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as shallow as it sounds. His perversion seems like a desperate cry for attention. A true figure of teenage angst, he is unlikeable in every sense of the word.\n\nAnd then, while I was reflecting on this whole ordeal, trying to find the reason for my fascination, it dawned on me: I would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve LOVED this show when I was fourteen. I thought I was exactly like Azusagawa: a lazy loner who can be very negative and kinda rude, but who is always right! He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always logical, always in the right, and you just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take that away from him! The quantum theory that so many people disliked only added to it: this story isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t based on some BS magic, but on real facts, logic and reason! It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s everything 14-year-old me ever wanted!\n\nAnd that just makes me hate it more. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll end it at that.\n    \n"}, {"id": 4028, "score": 10, "body": "Gundam SEED is Mobile Suit Gundam as seen by hardened anti-mecha fans. This review is hard to write, in that it's hard to laser in on the greatest faults of SEED, because it really does get almost everything wrong. But, let's go with the kneejerk one first. \n\nKira Yamato is a terrible character in every way. He is, simultaneously, a delusional idealist, a massive hypocrite, morally bankrupt, unlikable, unrelatable, the perfect human being, the least competent human being, and aggressively unfun to watch. Any fight with Kira has no tension in it, it is merely a question of when Kira decides to get serious and then wipe the floor with his perfect mobile suit that he can perfectly control. Within two episodes, _Kira finishes the operating system of an unfinished prototype mecha, while fighting off an opponent, while awkwardly crammed into the pilot's chair with someone else._ He does this in approximately 10 seconds. And the show likes to make the point that Kira is the perfect pilot, programmer, fighter, person, philosopher, idealist, and lover. Constantly. This is a show where, on frequent occasions, everybody stops to ask \"Where's Kira? What is Kira doing right now?\", because the setting revolves around him. Countless people die when Kira's superpowers could save him, because he just wasn't motivated enough to actually do something or he was so hung up on his asinine total pacifism _after sustaining a bodycount_ that he still hesitates to fight in the season finale. He fucks his friend's fiancee (almost on screen, to the complaints of Japanese mothers everywhere), and for the crime of not bowing to Lord Kira, Kira threatens to kill him. Naturally, the friend totally gets over this in a few episodes and goes back to loving Lord Kira. He is a textbook mary sue.\n\nThe most under-discussed part of SEED, in my book, is the pacing. SEED crawls. As SEED is a soft reboot / heavily inspired by the original 79 Gundam, the direct comparison of pacing is this: The protagonist's party is attacked, flees in a space ship, and arrives on Earth in the original show in 5 episodes, while getting respectable character establishment in for that length of time. SEED takes 15 episodes to do this, and manages to even pad out the runtime with a a recap episode! This is doubly unfortunate because remarkably little happens in that 15 episode stretch, resulting in the recap episode having to pad itself out to hit its intended length. Like a checklist, SEED runs down the list of events from 79 and adds perhaps one event. SEED now goes on its own for a while, not directly adapting the 79 show. Here, the pacing shifts from that long 15 episode stretch of waiting for one event to happen, to events happening evenly, just very slowly. Where we would expect one episode would be enough, two are used. This pattern continues until they go back to space around episode 40, at which point the show returns to adapting the 79 show again. This is also the point at which you realize one of SEED's other greatest failings.\n\nSEED's antagonists are atrocious. The 79 show sort of split the duty between the enemy royal family and the enemy ace, which made sense for its purposes of being a war drama focusing around a character evolving to meet the demands of the situation. SEED, however, doesn't really bother to do that. Kira is essentially the same person at episode 1 as he is in episode 48 (of the remaster). Consequently, there is nothing to really reflect in his antagonists. Therefore, the primary motivation of the opposing force in SEED is a poorly explained race war between the genetically modified colonists* and the naturally born Earth dwellers. I say poorly explained, because the argument really stops at \"I don't like genetic modification\". There is no real explanation for why the Earth dwellers are so virulently anti-modification. They aren't show to be religious, or worried about socioeconomic consequences for ubermensch to exist. They just, hate the principle of it, because they just do. They hate them so much that they are willing to nuke them out of existence, and the men on the field just don't question this. SEED goes very far out of its way to make the Earth people look bad. The Colonists also started an unprompted invasion of neutral colonies, so they're also morally bankrupt. If you want to understand exactly WHY anyone did anything in this setting, I hope you like reading the wiki, because the show does not explain a lot of key details in how the war started, or why it started, or what either side wants, or how they're organized, or really anything other than the basic.And then there's Le Creuset, the antagonist rival pilot. His motivation? He has none! You can kind of infer that he just likes war, or he's somehow bitter about how he was born, but it's just guesswork. The other antagonists of the show, like the Earth's insane research director who is clearly crazy (why haven't you noticed, earth federation command??), also have no motivation besides furthering the mindless race war that they were never given a reason to care about. And if you're a slightly redeemable antagonist (and sometimes if you're not), sometimes Kira's natural godliness will encourage you to hop sides into a hopeless neutral faction (read: Kira's posse) that will inexplicably save the day anyway, because Kira. This happens multiple times, and even the person hopping sides is just as confused as the viewer is.  \n\n*They call themselves coordinators, but based on their performance very few of them are coordinators. I strongly suspect this is a holdover from the original show, where Zeon's internal propaganda was that all spacenoids were newtypes, which was blatantly untrue and not falsifiable . SEED does not explain why they say this, since you surely have records of who was gene modified, so the population surely knows it's bullshit. \n\nThen, there's the niggles, of which there are countless. Frequently, things are name dropped but not explained. Commands are given that seem pointless, weapons are named but given no context as to what they are or how dangerous they are. Eventually, the original cast is sidelined so badly that Yamcha would be embarrassed. Scenes that might have emotional impact, are ruined by the unlikeablility of the cast and the meaninglessness of the plot and withheld information. One character has her established character assassinated and replaced with a generic peace princess halfway through. Several characters are hyped up as major shakers and then proceed to do nothing. Mass murderers are given a pass by the Kira posse because they're useful. The acting is poor. Composition is mediocre most of the time. Most of the sci-fi concepts are nonsense and were clearly written by people whose last drop of science education was in high school, in the 80s. The budget seems to be mishandled and spread very unevenly, leading to large stretches of shot-reverse shot stills with rudimentary lip flaps to save up for the next big action scene. The ensuing action scene will then heavily reuse shots from previous scenes. This review is already long enough, but suffice to say that there are maybe four episodes in the 48 episode run where I didn't question Sunrise's decisions at least every three minutes. \n\nSEED, being loved in Japan for some reason, got a remaster, which best I can tell only exacerbated SEED's problems. The upshot of the remaster is that they cut out a lot of reused scenes (the remaster still contains a lot of stock footage and flashes back constantly), which is a positive change. On the annoying-but-not-totally-unspeakable side of changes, the show frequently alternates between 720p new footage and 480i old footage. This is extremely distracting but you will eventually stop noticing as the other flaws of the show command your attention. The most egregious part of the remaster is that Sunrise has redrawn most faces of characters, when they are up close, to be more bishounen and shiny. This has the absolutely infuriating side effect of making everyone's face totally unreadable, meaning that any chance of \"show, don't tell\" acting is essentially gone. Every shot of a character reacting that was in the original, is now a waste of time, because it no longer conveys its original meaning. So, if for some reason you plan on watching SEED despite this review, I encourage you to watch the original and tough out the extra filler.  Or maybe the special edition pseduo-movie compilation. \n\nIn conclusion: \nSeed is a show with a badly written setting, characters, plot, and screenplay;\na show with poorly written and clumsily integrated music\nmediocre to outright bad mechanical and character designs\nand every original bone in its body, is fundamentally a bad bone\n\nThere is no reason to watch SEED. What it wants to do, has been done better by its predecessors. This show is not even fun to mock. There is absolutely no joy in it, and it was a chore to watch, with only morbid curiosity keeping me going. "}, {"id": 4040, "score": 20, "body": "This is an anime that is not so much horrible as it is horribly dull\u00e2\u0080\u0094I like to call it an \"atrocity of mediocrity.\" I'll get deeper into the plot and characters later but, fundamentally, the cardinal flaw with this show is that it is an ecchi series without very good ecchi. There is all the lack of plot and weak characterization you might expect from a major ecchi series, but very little of the fanservice-filled payoff. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like porn without the porn\u00e2\u0080\u0094nothing, in other words. 26 episodes of vapid, vacuous, banal, stale, insipid nothingness. And who would consider watching nothing for 26 episodes an enriching way to pass the time?\n\nOf course, To LOVE-Ru does, in fact, have the very vaguest semblance of a plot (at least in the first few episodes). Our main character, a man with a propensity for falling down on top of attractive women, is named Yuuki Rito. He lives a normal high school life... that is, until something shocking happens in the bath one day. While the unsuspecting Rito is minding his own business, a naked alien girl named Lala (who looks indistinguishable from a human besides her bright pink hair and tail) falls on top of him out of nowhere. Through a series of extraordinarily contrived misunderstandings, Rito accidentally proposes to this girl despite actually being in love with Haruna Sairenji, another girl at his school. Naturally, being utterly incapable of expressing himself to girls his age, he finds himself unable to call off the accidental proposal, and likewise unable to profess his love to the real girl of his dreams. To make things worse, the reason Lala ended up in Rito\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bath in the first place is that she is the crown princess of one of the most powerful civilizations in the galaxy\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093the Devilukeans\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093and was trying to escape a political marriage. As a result, any attempts by Rito to break off the engagement would likely offend the Devilukeans and might end not only in his death but the death of the entire world. So, with tensions as high as they are, Rito is obviously immediately inspired to go out and face his problems, clear up any misunderstandings and\u00e2\u0080\u0094just kidding, he acts like the hero he is and continues with his daily life as though nothing is wrong.\n\nYes, while a number of other aliens show up to either try to assassinate Rito or convince Lala to cancel the proposal, and countless other girls show up and dilute the situation further, as far as progress, there is none to be seen. Instead, the show remains in an awkward limbo, with Rito clearly in a situation in pressing need of his attention yet making only the most feeble and infrequent attempts at remedying this fact. In truth, most of the episodes don't even mention the main plot at all. Rather, they resort to episode long filler plots which range from bad to appalling. We see everything from Lala bringing in some alien tentacle monsters (animated with horrible CG) to cook and getting groped by them instead, to some insignificant side character dreaming about being in feudal Japan.\n\nTo summarize, the story is questionable and mostly ignored\u00e2\u0080\u0094there may as well be no story. But as I wrote above, in an ecchi show such as this one, sacrificing plot for fanservice is common practice\u00e2\u0080\u0094I daresay I prefer it that way. No one in their right mind would watch this show hoping for a complex or emotional story to blow them away, as that would only get in the way of what really matters here: the fanservice. What they might hope for, however, is a plot that would facilitate as much fanservice as possible. And here, is the heart of the issue. Despite advertising itself as \"a romantic comedy full of slapstick humor, sexy girls, and outlandishly lewd moments that defy the laws of physics,\" To LOVE-Ru contains a surprising dearth of lewdness. 90% of the fanservice in this series is composed of little more than panty shots and Rito being an accidental pervert by falling on top of girls, and the other 10% is rarely much better. Sometimes the series will go for almost an entire episode with very little fanservice, instead caught up in its lackluster filler plots\u00e2\u0080\u0094filler plots like the one about feudal Japan I mentioned above, which create practically no good opportunities for sexual moments. How could this become a flagship of the ecchi genre when it does ecchi in such a mediocre way? From what I have heard, this situation was largely caused by the anime deviating heavily from the manga, which is apparently much better. Certainly, if there is one good thing about To LOVE-Ru it is the character designs, which were taken directly from the manga.\n\nOn the topic of characters, I think it is high time I discussed them. To get straight to the point, they are clich\u00c3\u00a9 and uninspired. And unlike with the plot, being ecchi is absolutely not an acceptable reason for bad characters. Series like Nisemonogatari are proof that fanservice shows are perfectly capable of having well-written and unique characters. Now, rather than talk about them broadly, I think the best thing for me to do at this point is to scrutinize each and every character in needless detail.\n\nSo, without further ado, let's begin.\n\n# __Main Characters__\n\n\n__Rito Yuuki:__ From head to toe, Rito is comprised of little more than the standard elements of your friendly neighborhood harem protagonist. He's nice, bad at talking to girls, clumsy and if the size of his harem is any indication, the most attractive man in the galaxy. Only one little thing: he is absolutely, 100%, completely and fully opposed to anything even remotely sexual. Just imagining a girl in a swimsuit is too much for his sex-averse mind to handle. In this way, this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s failures stem largely from the failures of this one aspect of this one character: someone thought it would be a good idea to make the lewdest show around about a kid who doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like lewd things. It is one thing to have the protagonist of, say, a battle shounen be sex-averse, but for the main character of an ecchi anime to act that way is like trying to make a sports anime about a character who has a grudge against sports. Pure and simple: it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make any sense. I realize that such timid protagonists are not uncommon in ecchi harem shows like this, but I have always found this fact baffling, and this show certainly does nothing to reduce my confusion.\n\nOf course, the show does at least make feeble attempts at addressing this obvious contradiction, and it does so rather creatively by attempting to have Rito become the preeminent accidental pervert of the anime world. And this, to be totally and completely honest, is not actually such a bad idea. Now, instead of having some unsympathetic loser who goes around groping women as our main character, we have a fine, respectable young man who just\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 accidentally finds himself groping women sometimes. In a good anime, this could be a resounding success, creating lots of fanservice in an interesting way, but this is not a good anime. The vast majority of Rito\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accidental perversion takes the form of him falling on top of girls, and in doing so, finding his hands and/or face where they really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t belong. Sometimes these scenes are amusing, but by the end, they are so overused and so rarely varied upon that they quickly become tiresome more than anything.\n\nUltimately, Rito is mostly generic, and where he does deviate from the norm, he rarely achieves anything of particular note. With such a weak foundation on which to build the rest of the show, it is little surprise that To LOVE-Ru is so spectacularly unsuccessful.\n\n\n__Lala Satalin Deviluke:__ Rito\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fianc\u00c3\u00a9e Lala is nothing groundbreaking either character-wise, but she remains one of the stronger characters the show has to offer. Her personality is bubbly, upbeat, and... well, not very complex, but her demeanor is so resoundingly positive that I have great difficulty maintaining any lasting dislike for her. In essence, she is a bundle of joy, and while she is not the most richly wrought character to ever come out of the world of anime, her frequent presence is one of the few features that make this slog of a show bearable.\n\nBesides her personality, the other main aspect that sets Lala apart is her inventing abilities. Though she never comes off as particularly intelligent, we are told to believe that she is, in fact, a genius who regularly invents devices capable of nearly anything. Naturally, To LOVE-Ru being the show that it is, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnearly anything\u00e2\u0080\u009d usually takes the form of a device that causes fanservice-y shenanigans in some capacity. Be it a teleporter that causes the teleportees to lose their clothes along the way, a machine that swaps the genders of its users, or a pair of glasses that allows one to see through clothes, Lala\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inventions never fail to impress. As one of the few consistent producers of quality fanservice in the show, it is always a delight when an episode centers on one of these, though like all the good things this anime has to offer, they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to appear as often as they should.\n\n\n__Haruna Sairenji:__ Rito\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dream girl could best be described as blandness incarnate. The reason for Rito\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attraction to her, if we are to surmise from the two minutes dedicated to the subject during the first few episodes, is her extreme kindness. At first, there doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to be anything wrong with this, but as the show progresses it becomes increasingly apparent that the reason that Rito finds her kindness to be her most appealing characteristic is largely that it is her only characteristic of note. Despite being one of the most important characters in the show, her personality can pretty comprehensively be described with the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cnice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Though she never does anything actively offensive, her oppressive boringness made me quickly come to dislike any time she appeared on screen (which was quite frequent given that she is a major character). This dislike was only compounded by the fact that every time Rito is in her presence, he immediately becomes a blubbering, retarded cow of a human being and finds himself utterly incapable of expressing even the most basic of thoughts without stuttering seven thousand times. Even given that this kind of awkwardness is typical of anime romances, the extreme to which Rito takes it quickly makes it change from endearing and cute to tiresome and grating.\n\n\n#__Side Characters__\n\n\n__Konjiki no Yami (Golden Darkness):__ The \u00e2\u0080\u009cGolden Darkness\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a cold and distant alien assassin capable of transforming any part of its body into a weapon. It was sent to the earth to murder Rito so that Lala could be married off to some other alien prince. After it meets Rito in person, however, it discovers that he is actually kindhearted, and decides that killing him would be wrong. For the rest of show it remains officially still carrying out its mission to off Rito, but really just living on earth because it has come to like it there.\n\nOh, and it takes the form of a cute girl that goes by \u00e2\u0080\u009cYami-chan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Obviously. Cute girls can be cold-blooded killers too!\n\nYami as a concept is probably the most compelling any character in To LOVE-Ru gets, though, between her appearance, her dispassionate personality, and her status as a living weapon, she draws a few too many similarities with Rei Ayanami from Neon Genesis Evangelion to call her wholly original. If anything, she suffers from the same issue that Rito did: as an idea, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not bad, and in a good anime she would be a successful character, but (as has been firmly established) a good anime this is not. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s given none of the development a character with a setup this interesting deserves, instead mostly being used as the token deadpan girl and occasionally using her turning-body-parts-into-weapons ability for slapstick humor. If there is one character in this show who deserves to be a part of a better anime then it is surely the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGolden Darkness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n__Run Elsie Jewelria and Ren Elsie Jewelria:__ A childhood friend of Lala\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that comes to earth aiming to woo her. Run and Ren are really two separate personalities that live in one body as an alien that switches between male (Ren) and female (Run) every time it sneezes. As an idea for a character, sneeze induced gender-bending is so bizarre that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to really criticize it, and actually, Ren and Run\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personalities are fairly unique as well. Ren tries to win Lala\u00e2\u0080\u0099s affection by performing various masculine feats in the hopes of outdoing Rito, and Run, after (unsurprisingly) falling for Rito herself, ends up becoming an idol to try and impress him. Run and Ren are among the more infrequently appearing characters in the show, but when they do appear it is always a pleasure to see them.\n\n\n__Yui Kotegawa:__ Yui Kotegawa is a tsundere. By reading that one sentence, anyone could come to understand the entirety of her character, because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really all there is to it. There are no other nuances, no creative new takes, nothing\u00e2\u0080\u0094she is nothing more a tsundere at its purest and most creatively bankrupt. Well, perhaps I should give her at least a little bit more credit: there is, at the very least, a backstory. She is the president of the school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s morals committee and finds Rito\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accidental perversions repugnant, yet simultaneously she realizes that she is attracted to him for some poorly explained reason. Whatever her feeble reasons may be, though, the fact remains that Yui Kotegawa is a walking clich\u00c3\u00a9.\n\n\n__Mikan Yuuki:__ Mikan is Rito\u00e2\u0080\u0099s responsible little sister who essentially acts as his mother while their actual parents are conspicuously absent for nearly the entirety of the show. She appears frequently early on, but her influence wanes as the show progresses, to the point that she gets relatively little character development. This is really too bad, because, while not stunningly original, she has a sort of snarky air in the first few episodes which was one of the few things in this show that I found amusing. Plus, I find that it is always interesting to see the reaction of those close to harem leads as things get crazier. Alas, like so many elements of this show, any interest Mikan might have held was crushed by awful execution.\n\n\n__Kenichi Saruyama:__ Saruyama is the perverted best friend at its most tired and bland. He is so bland, in fact, that he holds the impressively unimpressive distinction of being my least favorite character in this show. His personality is so utterly formulaic that it could have been replaced with countless other similar characters from other shows and I suspect no one would even notice. To make matters worse, rather than appearing infrequently for (unfunny) comic relief like most characters of his ilk do, he often appears prominently, even taking the spotlight in a few places. Not only is he the main character of the bizarre and out of place feudal Japan episode I mentioned above, but he also is the focus of perhaps the worst episode of the entire show (although there are many candidates for this), in which an ugly alien creature gives birth in the school clinic and Saruyama is forced to help with the birth and later become a father figure for the child. God knows what extraordinary lapse of judgment must have occurred for the writers to think that making an episode about a side character helping an alien give birth was what this show needed.\n\n\nPrincipal: Why does this character exist? The principal is the disgusting old man who runs Rito\u00e2\u0080\u0099s school and appears regularly as so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009ccomic relief\u00e2\u0080\u009d to make public displays of his lust for high school girls. Because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s funny. The only saving grace for this abomination of a character is that even the writers seemed to agree that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s awful, and he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t appear very often. Additionally, unlike Saruyama, when he does appear, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to suffer through entire episodes with him as the main character.\n\n\n__Saki Tenjouin:__ Tenjouin is the token pretentious, arrogant \u00e2\u0080\u009cOjou\u00e2\u0080\u009d character. When she appears, she is always accompanied by two of her lackeys and tends to spend most of her time flaunting her class and purportedly extreme attractiveness. Her main purpose, however, is to serve as something along the lines of Lala\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rival in the early part of the show. I say \u00e2\u0080\u009csomething along the lines of\u00e2\u0080\u009d because Lala more or less ignores her presence, and she spends most of her time making a fool of herself in fanservice-y ways. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s irritating, but intentionally so, and honestly the episodes where she appears prominently tend to be some of the better ones in the show, so I harbor relatively little animosity towards her.\n\n\n__Shizu Murasame:__ The award for the most pointless character in this show must surely go to this ghost girl, who appears in one episode about a haunted old school building and then just sort of continues showing up for some reason. She never really contributes anything to the show\u00e2\u0080\u0094she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t appear to share any meaningful relationships with any other characters, never adds anything of value to the plot, has no comedic purpose, has no interesting dialog, never plays a part in any fanservice, she simply exists. It is as though the writers felt that some scenes seemed empty, so they created a new character, but couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be bothered to give her a reason to be there.\n\n\n__Risa Momioka and Mio Sawada:__ These best friends and classmates of Rito exist more or less entirely to compare the boob sizes of girls in Rito's class\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and then grope them just to be sure. Now, while I feel a deep admiration for anyone who has found a purpose in life as enviable as this, I do slightly question if this show needs not one, but two characters dedicated to showcasing it. At any rate, necessary or otherwise, these two are a staple of the show, appearing frequently to spice things up with a little sexual harassment.\n\n#__Summary__\n\nI suspect it was probably a little excessive of me to go through _all_ of these characters, but I hope I have made my point clear: most of the side characters can be defined by a few characteristics, the major characters are shallow and dull, and those characters that are interesting either appear infrequently or are poorly executed. The exact significance of having such weak characters may vary from person to person, but for me, it is the final damning blow in cementing To LOVE-Ru as a truly hopeless affair. I have not dedicated 2,000 words to lambasting these characters purely because it is fun (although to be fair, it is quite fun), but rather because I find that good characters are integral to creating a good show. Not only are they the foundation on which every other part of the work stands, they are the aspect of the work which most directly connects it to the reader. If I can empathize with a character, it makes the entire story all the more meaningful to me. And if, as with this show, I cannot connect with any characters, then it makes the experience merely a distant and pointless waste of my time.\n\nFor the most part then, the character designs are really the only good things the characters have to offer, and without any fanservice of particular merit, these designs are rarely put to good use. It is, I suppose, worth mentioning that the quality of the character designs also extends to the rest of the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appearance\u00e2\u0080\u0094the art style is certainly one of the very few strong points To LOVE-Ru has to offer. Although this is purely speculation, I suspect that the reason the character designs and art style stand out so much from the rest of the show is that they come directly from the manga, of which this anime is likely a botched adaption. Perhaps the blame for this animated abomination does not lie with Kentaro Yabuki\u00e2\u0080\u0094the To LOVE-Ru manga\u00e2\u0080\u0099s artist\u00e2\u0080\u0094but rather with the fine folks at Xebec animation studios who thought it would be a fantastic idea to take a successful manga, use its characters and scenarios, and then make an entire season of brainless filler content instead of actually following it. Granted, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure the manga is not high art either, but I am certain that it, at the very least, has the decency to compensate for its lack of depth with some honest-to-god fanservice. "}, {"id": 4043, "score": 30, "body": "#__The Ending__\n\nThings fall apart.\n\nFew endings have attracted more ire from fans than this one, and for good reason. Not only is the choice for Kirino and Kyousuke to form a couple utterly bewildering, but every other character in the series gets the short end of the stick to make it happen. Truthfully, the more I think about this ending the more things I find about it to hate. I hate the way Kanako\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feelings for Kyousuke were shoehorned in out of nowhere. I hate the way Manami is treated as the villain despite doing nothing wrong. I hate the apathetic manner that Kyousuke approaches the whole affair. And above all, I hate hate hate the way this ending will forever taint my positive memories of the rest of the series. Reading through my second Oreimo essay, it astonishes me that I was able to accept this and move on the first time I watched this show. How? How was I okay with this? How could anyone be okay with this? Imagine if, during the K-On! movie, the girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 plane to London crashed and all of them died. That sounds horrible, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it? Well, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about how I feel about this ending. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s completely out of place tonally, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s poorly executed, and it forever haunts the series with this depressing spectre.\n\nNow, for fairness sake, before I get too carried away with trashing the ending, I feel obligated to mention the relatively few things it actually does well. Episode fourteen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s confession scene was actually rather solid on an aesthetic level. If it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come with all the baggage of incest and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t involve ruining no less than three girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hopes and dreams to make it happen, it might have even been a good scene. The way that Kyousuke tries to catch Kirino by running but ultimately fails to reach her is a nice way of hearkening back to an earlier scene showing that Kirino was inspired to take up running because she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t catch up with Kyousuke many years prior. Likewise, the way Kyousuke ends up being assisted by Saori and Kuroneko really helps bring the narrative together in a neat way. I also particularly enjoyed Kyousuke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s line during his confession, \u00e2\u0080\u009call love is gross, whether in eroge or in real life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as it served as a surprisingly poignant way of rebutting Kirino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s constant proclamations of \u00e2\u0080\u009cgross!\u00e2\u0080\u009d over the course of the series. To sum up, the ending is bad not because of the way it is presented, but in spite of it. Most of the dialogue is good, everything is quite cinematic (in particular, the scene where Kyousuke forever rejects Kuroneko under the streetlamp has always stuck out to me), and production values maintain their quality from the rest of the show. The only problem is, well, the actual events that transpire.\n\nGlad we got that cleared up. Now let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talk about the bad.\n\nThe notion of incest was first noticeably implied around episode two or three of season two, and it only becomes more obvious from there. From this, it seems likely to me that this ending was not a sudden devilish idea upon the part of the writer, but rather a notion that he had been entertaining from early on. With this being as it may, it is astonishing to me that this ending is as messy as it is. Why does everyone confess to Kyousuke during the last five episodes if this was planned from the beginning? Why are so many characters hurt in the end? I simply don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand how he could let this happen. The rest of the series shows me that this man is clearly a fairly competent writer, so why? Did he do this as some kind of elaborate commentary on how normalizing incest eroge can lead to an anomie where people no longer see incest as a taboo? Almost certainly not. Will Kirino and Kyousuke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s love even last or is it merely some teenage fling that just happened to ruin the hopes and dreams of everyone around them? We can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be sure. Ultimately, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think we can ever know exactly what inspired the extraordinary lapse of reason that led to this ending. All we can do is wonder what happened?\n\nI touched on this a bit before, but the worst thing about this ending (and this is a lofty distinction considering the boundless number of things that I hate about the way this show ends) is definitely how damned sad it is. No one ends up happy\u00e2\u0080\u0094not even Kyousuke and Kirino. After their cinematic kiss at the end of the final episode, we are led to believe that they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even stay with one another. Society will forever condemn their relationship, they ruined their friendships with several people to make it happen, and in the end they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even stay together! If that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the dreariest ending imaginable, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure what is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and they got the good end of the deal. As I have mentioned, Ayase, Kanako, and Kuroneko all have their hopes of love mercilessly shattered, but the truest loser here, I think, is Manami.\n\nGood lord, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so sorry Manami. You didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deserve this. You didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deserve any of this. Not only is the scene that features her in the final episode the most painful in the entire series, it may very well be among the most painful scenes I have ever encountered in an anime. After confronting Kyousuke and Kirino about their relationship, she voices her disgust for what they are doing (a reasonable reaction to have, by all accounts) and then gets into a fistfight with Kirino. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to lie, I do like Kirino, but there was a real feeling of catharsis in seeing her punched mercilessly in the gut by Manami. Unfortunately, outside of the punch, nothing in this scene goes well for Manami in the slightest. She sustains substantial damage from Kirino herself, ultimately having her glasses broken. This leads to perhaps the eeriest part of the entire series for me. It is difficult for me to describe, but there is something deeply chilling about the way Manami looks without her glasses. The cute softness of her face is all but gone, and we are left with something harsh\u00e2\u0080\u0094almost scary. This is made all the more disturbing by what Manami says in this state: that Kyousuke and Kirino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship can never survive, and more importantly that she has always loved Kyousuke. Kyousuke, of course, rejects her in an irritatingly bombastic fashion. Then, in return she says \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat was the worst reply ever\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094 a line that would almost be funny if it weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so sad. In the end, while with Ayase, Kanako, and Kuroneko there was a definite sadness to their rejection, with Manami it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outright depressing. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but think of how, after this scene ends, she will go home to realize that she has lost her best friend and love of ten years. And she lost him to his own sister\u00e2\u0080\u0094someone who he can never even stay with. All of this from a show that was once an upbeat comedy series.\n\nI have rarely felt worse after watching an anime than after watching this scene. I felt empty and frantic and even a little bit nauseous. I wanted to bang my head against the wall until it gave way. I wanted to yell \u00e2\u0080\u009cFUCK YOU OREIMO!\u00e2\u0080\u009d at the top of my lungs. I wanted to run as fast as I could to nowhere in particular. Most of all, I wanted to purge this show from my mind, and perhaps from existence entirely. I am not an emotional man, but dear God, this scene\u00e2\u0080\u0094this ending broke me. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard that when it was first published, this ending caused such an outrage that many previous fans burned the entire series or sold it for almost nothing just to get it out of their possession, and I can see why. This may not be the worst ending ever, but it is certainly the most painful that I have seen. Between the way the harem elements were lazily shoehorned in, the way Kyousuke callously turns down the girls, and above all, the mean-spirited way that Manami is treated in her final scene\u00e2\u0080\u0094all in all, this is an ending that I will probably never forget. But for all the wrong reasons.\n\n#__Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Talk About Incest!__\n\nOne issue I have been skirting around in the discussion of this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ending is, of course, the incest. Now, I am not, on principle, against the use of consensual incest in fiction, but it has a very specific time and place where it is acceptable. Importantly, if a work is going to employ incest as a plot point (and if it wants to be taken seriously), it needs to a) treat the incest as an important plot element and b) treat the incest as a taboo. Neither of these things are really true of Oreimo. In fact, Oreimo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ending treats incest in a shockingly irreverent fashion. This is particularly odd to me because the first season seemed quite self-aware and contained many jokes poking fun at the way incest is fetishized in modern otaku culture. One of its great strengths was the way it contrasted Kyousuke and Kirino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growing platonic relationship with the sexual relationships in Kirino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eroge. Yet, somehow the series ends with a complete reversal: an unequivocal embrace of incest. In a sense, this serves to cheapen the platonic relationship of the first season by suggesting that there was always a sexual element to Kyousuke and Kirino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship. I can only ask: what happened? What was there to be gained by adding the incest element to this show? And if there was anything to be gained, why on earth was it executed so poorly?\n\nTo be fair to this show, not every element of the incest was poorly handled. The majority of the second season is dedicated to building up Kirino and Kyousuke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s romantic relationship, so there can be no complaints that it came out of nowhere. Moreover, a good amount of emphasis is placed on showing why the Kousakas developed their feelings for one another. The real star here is season two episode thirteen, which is probably the only genuinely good episode in the latter half of season two. This episode takes the form of an extended flashback narrated by Kirino. According to her, she looked up to her brother as a child but became disillusioned with him as he tended increasingly towards laziness and mediocrity during his adolescence. By the time the chronological start of the series came about, she had come to view the real Kyousuke as an entirely separate person from the brother she once admired as a child. This, I gather, is why she has few inhibitions about thinking about him romantically. Now, obviously this flashback sequence does not provide a complete picture of why this incestuous relationship came about; for instance, it does not explain at all why Kyousuke has no problems thinking about his sister romantically. Even so, it does a genuinely good job of putting Kirino and Kyousuke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s romantic relationship in a more believable context, so the flashback is certainly beneficial to the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall narrative.\n\nSadly, my praise ends there. While the motivations are fairly well done, the social aspect of the incest is seriously blundered. To see just how poorly this is handled, one need look no further than the aforementioned scene with Manami during the last episode. Since she is really the only character to express discontent with the idea of Kirino and Kyousuke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incestuous relationship, Manami can be viewed as a sort of voice for society. She says more or less what you would expect any normal person to say in this situation: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disgusting for siblings to be in a relationship.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If Manami\u00e2\u0080\u0099s statements led to some kind of real discussion about the implications of incest then perhaps I would be okay with this scene, but that is not what happens. Instead, Kyousuke bellows some impassioned nonsense about how he wants to \u00e2\u0080\u009cbring on that real sister end!\u00e2\u0080\u009d without ever meaningfully engaging with Manami\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ideas. Likewise, when Manami brings up the central question of what the Kousakas\u00e2\u0080\u0099 parents will think, Kyousuke responds with a shallow \u00e2\u0080\u009cPlease don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell my dad! He\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll kill me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThis is the crux of the issue. The writer appears to believe that merely mentioning that there are moral and social issues at play with incest is sufficient to make it acceptable. Kyousuke, Kirino, and, indeed, the show itself, seem to brush off these issues as though they are totally irrelevant. But, of course, they are not irrelevant. Imagine, if you will, if Vladimir Nabokov's seminal novel Lolita ended with the adult Humbert Humbert marrying 12-year-old Dolores Haze and the only reaction to this was one character who says \u00e2\u0080\u009cEw, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Obviously, this example is completely absurd, but it is worryingly similar to what happens in Oreimo. Despite incest being a serious taboo (not as serious as pedophilia, but still heavily frowned upon), the only negative reaction it receives is from Manami, and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s framed as the villain. Saori takes the middle ground, saying that she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really condone it but that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to try and stop it either, and everyone else says nothing negative at all. The only explanation I can see for why incest is treated this way in Oreimo is that the writer was only really interested in employing it at a purely shallow, fetishistic level. At the same time, though, he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to look bad so he pretended to treat it seriously by casually mentioning moral issues. Pure and simple, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bad, lazy writing.\n\nIn the end, Oreimo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s objectionable treatment of incest is, at best, tasteless, and at worst an active detriment to the entire brother-sister dynamic established by the first season. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not bad enough to ruin the show by itself\u00e2\u0080\u0094not for me at least\u00e2\u0080\u0094but combined with the deluge of other shortcomings present in this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ending, it seriously taints my viewpoint of the whole series. This is especially unfortunate because I liked the first season before I saw how things concluded\u00e2\u0080\u0094I really earnestly liked it. But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be damned if I ever want to watch, or even think about this show again after witnessing this atrocity of an ending. "}, {"id": 4044, "score": 30, "body": "By this point, so much has been said about this series that it's hard to tell what to actually think. How bad is Eromanga-sensei, really? Is it merely a raunchy comedy series that accidentally attracted a larger audience than intended? Or is it something far worse? To phrase the question simply, is Eromanga-sensei really that bad?\n\n...__Yes__.\n\nEromanga-sensei is an anime that is broken to its very core. Its first issue is the most basic issue any show can have: the premise is bad. It attempts (poorly) to tell the story of Masamune Izumi, a successful teenage light novel author with a remarkable ability for causing sexy things to inexplicably happen around him. Joining him in his lascivious endeavors is his loli sister Sagiri, a child who makes a living drawing porn (something something FBI\u00e2\u0080\u00a6). Incidentally, she also happens to draw the illustrations for Masamune\u00e2\u0080\u0099s novels; although, through a contrivance of cosmic proportions, he remains unaware of this fact\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 even though they live in the same house.\n\nThe sheer poorness of this premise is staggering.\n\nTo begin with, it lifts the aspiring light novel author plot directly out of Oreimo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first season. I was no fan of the idea there, and _certainly_ am no fan of it here. The notion that the fifteen-year-old Kirino could get a light novel published with such ease always struck me as a bizarre deviation from the relatively grounded nature of Oreimo's first season up to that point, and it strikes me as far worse in Eromanga-sensei, where the characters are all several years younger. \n\nTo make matters worse, the fact that Masamune has somehow remained unknowing of his sister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s profession despite her _living in the same house as him_ is downright asinine. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bad enough that I have to believe that an unremarkable teenager could get a series of successful novels published, but now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m also supposed to accept that his kawaii imouto does the illustrations and he never suspected a thing? No thanks\u00e2\u0080\u0094I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t buy it.\n\nI should mention that my intention here is not to suggest that realism is particularly important in anime; rather, I expect a slice of life series about otaku culture to have some grounding in the _reality_ of otaku culture. Otherwise, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the point? There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s simply no reason for the show to even incorporate elements of a real phenomenon like otaku culture if it only plans to skew them beyond recognition anyway. For all of its shortcomings, this was something that Oreimo did well. It painted a pretty shady picture of otaku culture, but (excluding the light novel section) it showed characters interacting with this culture in a very real and relatable way. They formed communities of fans, attended events, and even had heated discussions about their favorite anime. It was played comically, but there was a definite sense that these events came from a place of experience and passion for the world of otaku on the part of the author. None of this is the case in Eromanga-sensei. The characters of this show live in a distant fantasy world where teenagers write light novels and children create hentai. Being an otaku here means nothing more than enjoying lewd light novels with lewder drawings. This is not the reality of otaku culture\u00e2\u0080\u0094not to most people, at any rate\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the show gains nothing from portraying it in this way.\n\nFrom what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve written about its premise alone, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re probably expecting me to write an almighty diatribe against the rest of Eromanga-sensei, but actually, past its premise the show is barely worth discussing. Things progress exactly how anyone would expect them to. More unremarkable characters are introduced, more absurd situations occur, and the show settles into a routine of raunchy mediocrity punctuated only by the occasional scene offensive enough to warrant a reaction. I honestly think the show would have been forgotten almost immediately, lost in a slew of other sexual anime comedies, if not for these extra offensive moments. Thanks, however, to delightful scenes like the one where a twelve-year-old girl says \u00e2\u0080\u009cI love dicks\u00e2\u0080\u0094all girls my age do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d this show began an unfortunate ascension to the status of a meme. The good old anime memesters began crawling out of the woodwork, and eventually big figures in the community like Gigguk started paying the series some attention. Now, I love Gigguk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s videos about Eromanga-sensei as much as any other self-respecting weeb, but I do suspect that without them and the related memes, this series would have been quickly sentenced to a well-deserved eternity of obscurity.\n\nI bring this up because this meme-ability represents my other main problem with this series: it tries too hard to be offensive. This is speculation upon my part, but I believe that Eromanga-sensei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s writer knew that his brand of imouto-themed otaku comedies had waning relevance, so he deliberately used these shocking moments as a last ditch effort at increasing publicity for his work. And\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I guess it worked. These moments became memes and the memes became a form of free marketing for the show. I would call it ingenious if it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cause me and countless other hapless weebs to waste five hours of our time watching a terrible anime. To clarify, none of this is to say that I have any inherent problem with Eromanga-sensei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nature as a offensive show. Being bawdy is an excellent and time-honored way of approaching humor, and Eromanga-sensei\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 sometimes does it well. The dick-lover scene is bad, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bad not because there is any inherent problem with twelve-year-olds who love dicks; rather, it fails because it does nothing particularly humorous with this idea. This is the core of the problem: instead of using offensive elements as a means to create humor, these elements are played as though they are intrinsically humorous.\n\nWhat seems oddest about this situation is that the writer occasionally uses bawdy elements to make actual jokes, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear that he understands how to do this, he just fails to do it most of the time. For instance, compare the dick-lover scene to a later scene in episode twelve where Sagiri tries to draw some good ole hentai but can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to correctly identify the location of the male genitals. This scene is also rather lewd, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s much funnier than the dick-lover scene because it manages to go beyond being superficially raunchy and makes a real joke (namely that Sagiri pretends to be experienced about sex but is really laughably na\u00c3\u00afve). Being the sort of tasteless person I am, I think I would have earnestly enjoyed this series if it were able to keep to the obscene-but-funny standard set by this last scene. Instead, however, Eromanga-sensei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s humor falls as flat as its premise, leaving us with a series that is worthless from almost any viewpoint\u00e2\u0080\u0094a series, in other words, that is not only trashy but _trash_ as well. \n\n__Note:__ I used the phrase \"dick-lover scene\" three times in this review without even meaning to. I feel like that says _something_ about the kind of anime Eromanga-sensei is..."}, {"id": 4056, "score": 40, "body": "_Kuzu no Honkai_ (\"Scum's Wish\") had interesting premises. As the title suggests, this series wanted to explore the mean, sick, selfish side of love. To portray an unidolized and more mature view on this subject, the author decided to focus on teenage highschool students. Wait, that must be a mistake... but no, unfortunately it is not. And here lies the first issue I have with this show.\n\nThe protagonists are teenagers - and even those that are adults don't really behave as such. Japanese viewers seem to really like highschool settings, to the point they do not realize it isn't necessarily the right one for every plot. Although some teenagers are certainly capable of mature feelings, whoever watched this series will probably agree it would have been more believable with adult protagonists. One of the main point of the plot is that most characters cannot let go of their long-lasting feelings towards someone who doesn't love them back. If you consider that the protagonists are 16 years old at the start of the story, said long lasting love probably arose when they were very young. It sounds a little weird for them to obsessively hold on to such an immature love, losing their mental health over it, instead of exploring the world and meeting new people like any adolescent would do. And even though one character could be an exception, exactly four behave this way. Isn't that a bit too many? Exploring love from different angles would have been so much more interesting than repeating the same pattern over and over again.\n\n~~~img420(https://i.imgur.com/vk8dvPN.gif)~~~\n\nSex was another part of the show I didn't quite digest. It was refreshing to see an anime that does not shy away from it, and viewers can surely appreciate that it was not portrayed in an overly ecchi manner, but was it really necessary to dwell on it so much? At some point the title of the anime could as well have been switched to \"[Who's Fucking?](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4NL9i-Fu15hYD2O2Ea0YkJA8b6b8ceMA)\" since the main event of each episode was who would be with whom. However, I must give credit to this series for showing sex as an important part of love and life. One reason _Kuzu no Honkai_ was so appreciated is probably because sex in anime is either glossed over or depicted in an extremely silly way. Thus, the viewer is usually deprived of this important part of a couple's story. I hope more romance series will try to incorporate sex in their narratives, perhaps overcoming _Kuzu no Honkai_'s weaknesses and rectifying its shortcomings.\n\n~~~img420(https://i.imgur.com/87n0zay.png)~~~\n\nTalking about the characters, I have mixed feelings. The main protagonists, namely Hanabi and Mugi, felt quite real and original. I loved Mugi's tormented relationship with women, which resulted in his love towards his wicked professor. I would have really liked Hanabi's personality, had it been more coherent. I'm not referring to her being both kind and selfish, as I actually found that pretty realistic and fascinating. What I'm talking about is her looking like a completely different person when she is with her friend Sanae. Some of her choices seemed very weird to me, too. However, all in all I think she is a good character. The sadness and loneliness she transmits to the viewer feel very tangible, and I liked that.\n\n~~~img(https://i.imgur.com/gJpSaQT.jpg)~~~\n\nThe male and female professors... well, that is another matter interely. Obviously the biggest problem is Akane-sensei. She would have been perfect as an evil boss in a shounen. But here? Honestly, she is completely hilarious. Her lack of empathy and guilt, together with her hostily towards people, are worthy of the worst antisocial personality. Since everybody else has a somewhat balanced characterization, her overstated deviance looks very out of place. And her career as a professor is what sounds least believable of it all. The series tries to give it some credibility by telling us she really likes to teach... but it just doesn't work. \"Show, don't tell\" is one of my favourite techniques. Unfortunately, what _Kuzu no Honkai_ is telling us about Akane-sensei and what it shows are two different things. And now on to Kanai-sensei, our male teacher. As the anime often states, he saw his mother in Akane-sensei... and subconsciously followed Freud's teachings (as a Psychology student that really made me giggle). He is a dull, uninteresting, clich\u00c3\u00a9d \"good boy\", and although his characterization would have been perfect for a shiba inu, it is no good for a highschool professor. The only moment I felt somewhat close to him was when he stepped on his own glasses.\n\n~~~img420(https://i.imgur.com/JT1CyUJ.png)~~~\n\nThe other characters are pretty good and, exception made for our two professors, everyone had its fair share of character growth, which was not bad.\n\n~~~img420(https://i.imgur.com/3ASUphL.png)~~~\n\nSo far we have talked about the intricated love ~~triangle~~ ~~square~~ complicated polygon among a bunch of 3deep5u adolescents and some questionable professors. But what about the technical sector? The soundtrack didn't strike me as remarkable, but it was always fitting and some tracks were pretty emotional. I loved the opening and ending of the series; the ending in particular was very creative (although there definitely was [some vagina](https://i.imgur.com/TKP1WJ1.png) in the background??). The adaptation of the manga art was well done and the characters [look pretty](https://i.imgur.com/KUY8sS5.gif), even if similar. What I really had problems with was the direction, or to be more precise some of its choices. Apparently the director wanted this anime to look like a manga, and he kept inserting scenes inside of frames and squares like they were manga panels (picture above). On occasions the old scene was [kept as a blurred background](https://i.imgur.com/GvSp58K.png), while on others it was splitted into two sections (picture below). Inserting rectangles inside the screen [created huge blank areas and made everything feel very asymmetric](https://i.imgur.com/zq9JHNP.png). As you can probably guess, it just did not work well. Given the result was hard to follow and weird to look at, I can't see the reason for this artistic choice. Exception made for this, direction, art and sounds are all pretty good.\n\n~~~img420(https://i.imgur.com/lX3BKm7.png)~~~\n\nSince we have come to the end of the review, let's sum it up. _Kuzu no Honkai_ succeeded in portraying the inconvenient side of love. In doing so it was at times emotional and realistic, at times excessive and not very belieavable. The protagonists are well done, other important characters are not. The same goes for the artistic part: _Kuzu no Honkai_ was pleasant to look at and to listen to, but the direction messed up badly in some scenes and made them look straight out of Windows Movie Maker. All in all, if you like romance, drama, love polygons and are okay with some feels, you might enjoy this short series. If you would like to watch a similar series but done better, I suggest: [White Album 2](https://anilist.co/anime/18245/White-Album-2/) (by the same director), [Aku no Hana](https://anilist.co/anime/16201/Aku-no-Hana/), [Paradise Kiss](https://anilist.co/anime/322/Paradise-Kiss/) or [Natsuyuki Rendezvous](https://anilist.co/anime/13585/Natsuyuki-Rendezvous/). All these series show love from a realistic, mature and sometimes sad perspective.\n"}, {"id": 4071, "score": 0, "body": "This might be the single worst hentai, let alone anime, that I've ever seen barring something with a reprehensible fetish, and that's quite a feat.

After confroning him about it, she is seduced by him, and is taken to new places of erotic heights.

The animation of the Meet 'N Fuck flash series is better than this, and that barely moved.

With a generic as fuck soundtrack, along with bland and annoying voice acting and sound effects. I guess someone only had a lunch break to edit this whole thing together, and that included trying to get all of the sound effects.\n\nSeeing the whole thing, I refuse to believe that this was pressed to a DVD. There is absouletely no way someone would pay to have this released to the general public.

Only three. I thought that was impossible given the vast scope and depth of the awful things the internet had to offer.

It's so unappealing to look at that I can't imagine anyone jerkin' it to this unless you've literally never seen porn, or even know very little about sex, and this is your first experience to it.

Chivalry of a Failed Knight was considered somewhat refreshing, occasionally playing around with awful tropes and channeling the power of competent screenplays and exciting directing to turn a school battle LN adaptation into something worth watching. Conversely, The Asterisk War failed to meet even the basic requirements to function as a generic work of fiction. It's barely worth the effort it takes to write about it, let alone animate it.\n\nBefore we start, I dare one of you to make a thread or a blog showcasing the exact amount of problems each episode has. Don't make a drinking game out of it, or you'll die of alcohol poisoning by episode 8. The show literally starts with the main puss ass lead walking into our Tsundere in the middle of undress, under the pretenses that she dropped something important to her. After she claims to owe him one, she tries to incinerate him out of nowhere, resenting him for the rest of the episode in the process. This sets a precedent as to how badly this show will execute and contradict everything, like being low enough to over-sexualize a 13-year-old who regularly gets slapped by her uncle and saved by Ayato, whilst simultaneously acting like her asking for a sparring match the main character she fought of her own volition before is in any way indicator of her strength as a person. Just to provide the illusion that broke as hell Ayato isn't obscenely powerful, they provide flimsy limiters that only work when he uses a specific weapon for too long, despite that he often goes past the time limit of the limiters with no problem until the match finishes. The show breaks its rules so often that its ravaged narrative arcs become that much worse. Even the interesting ideas this dreck presents aren't capitalized, let alone worth capitalizing on in the first place.\n\nThe world-building is easily the most fractured part of this dumpster fire. The tournament arc has been hinted to be a tournament in which things can get deadly and bloody for competitors, but no one gets remotely injured or killed, aside from that one pointless and awkwardly done flashback scene at the very beginning., if students can summon hovering screens with their hands for no reason, then why do they need to hold them, and why is there actual paper involved? The world-building of this show is some of the worst I've ever seen, as if the narrative wasn't already cheap enough with its trite nonsense, missed opportunities, and romantic mood killers designed to preserve a terrible harem.\n\nSpeaking of which, Ayato is as horribly characterized and intolerable as his harem, which is one of the worst in the mainstream anime hemisphere. Julis is a trash tier Tsundere who plays up that trope to obnoxious degrees, especially when she retardedly blows up her room in an attempt to scorch him alive for the crime of accidentally seeing her in her underwear. Saya is an obnoxiously possessive loli with all the intolerable tropes you'd expect. Kirin is an annoyingly squeaky pushover with a ridiculously lousy character arc As for Claudia, anything she has going for her can be boiled down to sass, sex appeal, and an insidious and mysterious nature that I guarantee this show won't capitalize on. The other characters are either stupid or wasted, with almost no middle ground beyond just being \"there\". Easily the most crushing case of the latter is Irene, who is a dangerous punk with a heart of gold and an interesting design. They go out of their way to do nothing interesting with her when it's time for her to fight our unbearable main lead in the finale, and the closest we ever get is how her younger sister keeps her in check, which has also been done a million times. When a character like her is the best character in the show, it speaks volumes of just how worthless this cast is.\n\nVisually speaking, this show isn't much better. The colors are certainly bright, and some of the character designs can actually be pretty neat and sexy but the artwork is pretty miserable. It's a low-budget SAO and Aldnoah.Zero style with even shittier and more incomprehensible choreography, and even more all-encompassing fugly CGI. Much like the show itself, the visuals are bad at even pulling off being generic and mediocre, barring a few relatively dazzling environments. Even the aesthetics are gaudy and nonsensical, and the cuts of actually good animation are few and far between. At least Andloah.Zero had some flourish to make up for generic style and cheap CGI.\n\nThe OST is a mixed bag of vanilla background noise, awful dubstep, and ill-fitting emotional pieces. Even the OP is a milquetoast pop song, in spite of it being catchy. The ED titled \"Waiting for the rain\" by Maaya Sakamoto and Ramsus Faber is the only stellar bit of music in the show, as it's a pretty stellar emotional track to close out each episode with. Even the visuals are interesting, with the show swapping the positions of a bunch of color-coded silhouettes of each harem member, which are accompanied by some actually pleasant techno melodies and Maaya Sakamoto's warm, even uplifting voice. Still, if having one good track is all the audio needs to be unquestionably better than every other aspect of this show combined, then I really can't find a better way to call this show dogshit.\n\nPeople put themselves through hell slaving away at this, and no one did a remotely good job beyond the musicians. That's as sad as the show itself. This anime isn't even infuriating or laughable, just annoying and lifeless, which is one of the purest tells that this has no value I can assign to it, let alone any reason to be watched enough to garner a second season. It even fails to live up to its title in any way, shape or form. How this got popular is beyond me, and I'm glad it's dead."}, {"id": 4137, "score": 38, "body": "\"Too little, too late\" is a painful phrase.\n\nAfter 12 episodes of broken nonsense, this show somehow got a second season that attempted the impossible: being a competent sequel to The Asterisk War. By some miracle, it succeeded. Not to say that this show is even remotely good now, but this second season somehow turned being awful into an accomplishment. I'm not sure whether to be impressed or depressed.\n\nPart of why this second season managed to improve upon the first one is that it actually makes an attempt to have dynamic characters, giving every character something to do, posing an actual threat for the main character, and attempt slightly more meaningful character arcs. It doesn't necessarily succeed in many of these areas, as the asspulls are still as frequent as the world-building is disastrous. However, for the first time, I felt slightly engaged in what was going on. The new characters such as Sylvia had genuinely cool designs and personalities, and some of the returning characters that barely got any screen time last season actually become genuine threats that bring actual life to this show during the end of the show's tournament arc. Hell, the final bosses of the arc --two literal robots-- have some actual chemistry and character development, both of which were missing in this franchise. The irony here is adorable.\n\nSadly, the tournament arc ends around episode 8, the show spends its final episodes trying at giving someone other than our main lead an emotional arc that was set up in the first season. The foundation of the first season had already collapsed in on itself, so seeing Julis' childhood friend that got teased in the early parts of season 1 was almost enough to keep me invested for an episode...before nearly falling asleep. None of the actually worthwhile side characters like Sylvia or the two robots Ayato would fight in the Phoenix Festa tournament make an appearance, and we're left with our dry harem, which only got marginally better than the first season. It's far too late to flesh any of them out now as we already spent an entire season enduring them as obnoxious caricatures with nothing going for them. There's no way for me to care about Julis's problems or Claudia's sneaky advances on Ayatofu. Even seeing some of the more neglected side characters Ayato hung out with in season 1 team up wasn't enough to get me to care about them, and that's because of season 1. If these characters were written as anything more than sleazy caricatures of archetypes beforehand, then maybe seeing the show try to do interesting things with them would have been more satisfying. It also would have helped if the show's idea of character development was natural growth instead of making Kirin radically more stern and mature than before out of nowhere. Sadly, all I can do is attempt to cherish what obligatory efforts the writers made to make us care about a couple of mediocre side characters.\n\nWhile the awful artwork and art style mostly hasn't changed, they are a few moments of impressive visuals, such as the very first scene of the season. The sequence where Sylvia sings to Ayato is also pretty nice, as it's both a visual and narrative highlight for the show. Sadly, the fights are still terrible overall, as like last time, they're either incredibly clunky or immensely difficult to follow. There's no real middle ground here. The closest they come to that would be the final fights of the two major arcs of the season, which are admittedly entertaining, if not necessarily well-animated.\n\nThe music is still incredibly mediocre, with no memorable OSTs whatsoever. They do have the courtesy to throw in a new vocal track and a few new pieces of background music, but the only highlights are the songs that open and close each episode. The OP for this season --\"The Asterisk War\" by Shiena Nishizawa-- is incredibly frantic, albeit a tad unwieldy with the frantic techno beats in the chorus. Once again, it's the ED that shines compared to everything else, as Haruka Chigusa's \"Ai no Uta -words of love-\" is a catchy and relatively heartwarming piece with pleasant vocals and visuals of characters actually having fun for once.\n\nSadly, this season is still not worth your time if you didn't already enjoy the first season. It tries to do what legitimately good sequels do, yet it fails thanks to its own incompetence and the borderline irredeemable failings of its predecessor. It's still a mess with largely terrible characters, nonsensical world-building, and asspulls galore. It still fails to animate good fight scenes. It still fails to be captivating for more than a few minutes at a time. At the very least, the attempt was there, which is more than I can say for the first season. That doesn't mean people like me are going to care since it's the sequel to The Asterisk War. No matter how good a sequel it may be, it would always be limited by the unsalvageable foundation that series built for this now dead franchise."}, {"id": 4140, "score": 32, "body": "# [~~~**This review will contain Spoilers for the show!**~~~]()\n<br>\nSatsuriku no Tenshi... a decent but nowhere near good attempt at adapting a game...\n##### *(I would also like to point out that this review won't include the ONA, duh...also cause I didn't see it xd)*\n\n\n[**_(SPOILER AHEAD)_ STORY:**]()\nThe story revolves around a girl named Rachel Gardner.\nShe is trapped in a building with several stories in it.

She'll help him get out while he has to kill her at the end of it. \n\nThe two make their way throughout the several levels defeating each and every character that gives them a puzzle.\nI won't be going through every and each puzzle as they are very long and complex (I suppose). \nEach puzzle consists of Rachel thinking of ways to resolve the issue and Zack beating something in the corner. Yeah if you ask me thats kind of a waste of a character, Zack out of all the characters felt like the best one in this show. The puzzles themself aren't that interesting to be perfectly honest. They try to shed light on their past or their actions but in such a way that it just leaves you more confused than before, I suppose they would work better in the Source (Video Game).\n\nTo rub salt over the wound that this show created, we don't even get an ending.\nWe just get a cliff hanger... the rest of the stories is supposedly on the ONAs... yeah cause why not I suppose :v\n\n~~~img420(https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-dkOSf_7sDHc/W3nHKFI-GjI/AAAAAAAA4io/lm9sVyDhJeUAESuzwQT10TAJ55pYsrMDwCJoC/w500-h245/1531185020_KILLME.gif)~~~\n<br>\n\n\n[**CHARACTERS:**]()\nThe characters presented in the show are interesting but not that engaging.\nDon't get me wrong, I think that Zack and Rachel combo was nice and there was a really nice contrast between the two but Zack was the only one that stood out the most, not only that his VA (Nobuhiko Okamoto) did an amazing job at delivering his lines his personality was also something to behold. A little tsundere who had a traumatic up bringing. Rachel on the other hand... what we get from the show is that... her parents got killed. Somehow.\nIt is clear that in the ONA these plot holes would get resolved but, as mentioned before, we're focusing on this season.\n\nThe supporting cast was also quite interesting and at times creepy.\nActually scratch that, the supports were 90% of the time creepy. Especially the Doctor with the eye fetish.\nThere really is not much to write about the supports. They filled in a role of an obstacle, their personalities varied, yes.

Sadly Angels of Death fell flat on its face after giving us somewhat of a promising first episode. Deeper into the story, it convoluted into something terrible and spat all over the horror genre and should not by logical means even be called horror, because it was a yawn-fest and never once did get scared or had an intense moment while watching this sorry excuse of an anime. To put it very simply, it was a waste of space in the Summer of 2018 when it was airing back then. \n\n<h1><b>Story</b></h1>It centers around a girl, Rachel Gardner who for unknown reasons are in this abandoned asylum. She wakes up there not able to remember anything and finds her self eye to eye with a mass serial killer. Something triggers in her as she goes through some messed up experience in the first episode to make her regain a portion of her memories. Now she is suddenly willing to die, but the serial killer, Zach only kills people who are in utter despair and those who tense up in the moment of death, which leads to Zach refusing to kill her. Being completely oblivious he finds himself needing her help to get out of this asylum, they team up and move on. Zach promises to kill her once they can escape from the place. \n\nThe asylum has all kind of insane people, and everyone for what weird reasons want Rachel, whether it is out of some twisted form of love or something less messed up but not by much. The story is mainly to get out of the asylum and have Rachel killed; her wish fulfilled once they do so to say.\n\nThis anime tries too hard to make points but fails too hard. It lacks balance and things feel random and just an excuse to move on. The only saving factor is the combo between Rachel and Zach, with to some extent is possible to find entertaining. There are some arc's which I did enjoy, but not entirely.  However, unfortunately, that alone was not enough for me. \n\n<h1><b>Sound</b></h1>\n\nThe soundtrack is okay and nothing groundbreaking but not bad either, it gets the job done as much you can for this anime, in this case. The only memorable part for me was the ending song, which I enjoyed listening. Besides that, no OST stood out too much.  \n\nThe voice, on the other hand, was good, for Zach I mean. It fit his character but his laugh got very annoying further in the anime you come. Rachel's was annoying for other reasons, I am sure you can imagine why.\n\n<h1><b>Art and Animation</b></h1>As for art, it's nice, and I do like it to an extent. The character design of Zach looks interesting, while Rachel I won't deny does look cute, and from my understanding, there were not too many moments where the art seemed too off. It got the job done, just like the soundtrack. No major annoyance comes to mind.\n\nLastly, the animation was not bad, when it mattered you could see the studio putting some form of effort. All said and done, as you might expect, it was not stellar and it mostly used still frames when it could.\n\n<h1><b>Characters</b></h1>Being one of my favorite aspects to any literature or media, it didn't satisfy me for this anime. Beside Rachel or Zach, there was no other character that I enjoyed or wanted to see more. They just became a pain as they arc went on, and didn't add much to my enjoyment at all. For the most part, they were quite dull and boring. The main combo also started to annoy me further down the road for more many reasons; the most annoying was Rachel continually saying how she wants to die and so forth. While everyone got the backstory and proper characterization, it didn't mean much when the character themselves was not so interesting or entertaining.\n\nZach could possible save this anime to some extent, but the menacing and scary vibe he had going for him, was gone by the 2nd episode if not before.  In the end, he became comedic, and I couldn't take him as serious. Every action he took just made me giggle or cringe from how stupid it was and so on.\n\n<h1><b>Conclusion</b></h1>If you got time on your hand, then please don't sit down and watch this anime. It's not worth it, and although, this is my opinion, I still believe it be very accurate. If you want horror anime, then this won't satisfy you and likewise with the mystery genre. However, if you are having trouble sleeping, then this might be good medicine for that. I did almost fall asleep once or more times than I can count while watching it. This anime was without a doubt one of the most disappointing anime of 2018.\n\n<center>\n<h1><b>Overall Scores</b></h1>Story: 1/10\nCharacters: 3/10\nArt: 5/10\nEnjoyment: 2/10\nOverall: 2.75/10\n\n</center>"}, {"id": 4168, "score": 30, "body": "The idea of falling asleep next to someone is an appealing idea, especially if they're someone who you're interested in, and I can see how a series like Pillow Boys (Makura no Danshi) could appeal to someone.

You've got everything from a high school student who acts tough, but is frightened by spiders, to a mature working man, and it's even got twins, which is a bit weird, but OK, sure, whatever.\n\nYou don't really spend much time with any of them, considering that the already short OP takes up a giant chunk of an \"episode\", which is only 4 minutes long, but before any of the guys can even talk, the credits are already playing over the episode. That's how short each episode is. Maybe make the episode a bit longer for those who don't immediately fall asleep when their heads hit the pillow. I'm pretty sure the people who would want this would want a few more minutes spent with their favorite person.\n\nThis whole concept would be great, except for one itsy bitsy tiny little detail. One of the characters is described as a \"super-energetic, hot 5-year-old\". Excuse me, but what the fuck? A 5-year-old? Yeah, no, I don't feel comfortable having one of the characters be old enough to be in kindergarten be in a series in which you're supposed to find the character on screen attractive to some extent, even if it's not supposed to be sexual. And describing them as \"super-energetic\" and \"hot\".

I can't really recommend a series that describes a 5-year-old as \"super-energetic\" and \"hot\", not matter how desperate you are when looking for a series to fall asleep to.

What was the point of it? What was I supposed to feel towards the show or the characters? What were their intentions? Did they think people would actually like this series?\n\nBecause you know, what little revelations there were presented within the show only led to further questions. The questions just kept on piling up and by the show's conclusion, almost none of them were answered. Nothing was really satisfactorily resolved, and if you asked me, I don't think I'd be able to explain the motivation for any character's actions.\n\nLike even now, I'm still wondering what the fuck the closest thing RDG has to an antagonist was hoping to accomplish by summoning an army of dead samurai ghosts to the school festival at the end. \n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/5OjQ0pD.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/8acDcGn.png)~~~\n\nWas he going to use them to attack other students?

I've attempted to do the same for Red Data Girl.\n\nimg500(https://i.imgur.com/xSd0Lza.png)\n\n...I'm not sure if that even helps. Or even makes sense at all. But that is more or less the general gist of what I could gather of the characters (that matter) in Red Data Girl. Now\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 for the long version\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\nFirst off, we have our main female lead. Izumiko Suzuhara. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a high school girl who wants to be just that. A normal ordinary high school girl. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just one problem. Whenever she comes into contact with technology like computers or cell phones, it breaks. Unfortunately, this is the result of being the next primary vessel of a supernatural entity that possesses the capability of destroying all of humanity.\n\nShe is deeply deeply aware of the differences between her and \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Goddess\u00e2\u0080\u009d and fears that those around her see her not as Izumiko, but a vessel for an almighty supernatural entity.\n\nThen there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s of course our main male lead, Miyuki Sagara. \n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/gr79kCD.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/u4a3Siz.png)~~~\n\nHe had to come along with Izumiko when she started high school in Tokyo because he is to serve as her protector since she houses a supernatural deity that can very well bring the entire world to ruin if she happens to let it run unchecked. But in actuality, Miyuki of course initially wanted nothing to do with Izumiko. If anything, his father kind of forced him into this and beat him when he expressed other wishes.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/tN4J9Uu.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/azxI9q7.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/oPtcUUy.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/9GBTrXb.png)~~~\n\nLike... took him to the woods and then violently assaulted him until he submitted. And then said with a straight face that \"he fell down a hill.\"\n\nAnd just coincidentally he's completely changed his attitude. He totally went back on everything he was saying before _WILLINGLY AND NOT BECAUSE HE WAS VIOLENTLY BEATEN._\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/BlRuk75.png) \n\nThis of course leads to Izumiko and Miyuki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship throughout the show to be a\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 rocky one. As Miyuki is forced into all sorts of dangerous events as a result of having to protect Izumiko and Izumiko feels guilty that Miyuki is literally forced into being her servant. I mean, that's a hell of a way to begin a \"partnership.\" Your father tells you that you're supposed to serve this girl for the rest of your life, kicks the ever living shit out of you when you refuse, and you end up giving in because you're genuinely afraid that your father will outright kill you if you refuse any further. Yeah, what a great way to start them off on the right foot.\n\nLiterally _FORCE_ them to be together.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/mHvvZBD.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/MHqx560.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/IabTV9J.png)~~~\n\nIn the perfect hypothetical version of this series that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist, Izumiko and Miyuki would be the main focus of the series. Like, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the interesting ones. And believe it or not, despite the fact that Miyuki started out almost vehemently disliking or even hating Izumiko and then like in an episode or two that just being completely dropped\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\nI actually didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t _despise_ the relationship between Izumiko and Miyuki. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/SOkwHIK.png)\n\nI mean I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s saying a lot for me as I found the primary romance in at least two of the other P.A. Works shows I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve reviewed almost __unbearable__. Like for this one I could at least say yeah okay maybe if it was a bit more focused on or developed more.\n\n...Oh. Speaking of, their relationship never actually progresses to that of a romantic nature within the actual show. I'm just referring to it as such because you know, the goddamned opening completely gives it away immediately. Because you know, you gotta have that to lure them in. Even if in the material this series is adapting they're not at that point yet.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/swj6B9G.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/1bj0NMl.png)~~~ \n\nBut anyways, the show is of course not centered entirely around Izumiko and Miyuki. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another plot that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening as well and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where things really become a mess\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\nOkay, so apparently, the school ~~Izumiko decided she wanted to go to in~~ Izumiko's family wants her to go to in Tokyo is in fact a nexus of people with supernatural ability, and the school is divided into two factions vying for control.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/hP011zF.png)\n\nIchijou Takayanagi is the head of one of the factions and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 well. I guess the quickest and easiest way to put it is that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the closest thing to an antagonist that this series has. Like I already mentioned, I never caught a single whiff of what this guy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal was. He was just being an asshole to be an asshole I guess.\n\n_\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy\u00e2\u0080\u0099d you summon an army of ghosts?\u00e2\u0080\u009d_\n_\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m the bad guy, duh.\u00e2\u0080\u009d_\n\nAnd then\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and then you have the Souda Alliance. Triplets! \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/tMCU2Dd.png)\n\nOr rather twins because one of them died and became a supernatural entity/ghost monster that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still capable of appearing in humanoid form to a very limited amount of people, or even taking limited control of his brother and sister.\n\nTo be honest, the Souda siblings were one of the primary sources of a lot of my frustrations with this series. There just seems to be so much time dedicated to them and they are just\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 number one, with the exception of their ghost sibling, they are WAY less interesting than the main characters. \n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/zQBkRdx.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/ldet6o1.png)~~~\n\n_Masumi is the ghost sibling. He just slaps the antagonist around while the other two Soudas are wasting their time with this weird stupid school politics crap._\n\nNumber two, there is a point where the show itself forced me to turn on the Souda Alliance entirely and permanently. Like they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supposed to be friends with Izumiko and Miyuki but they lead them into the woods while on a trip to ambush and attack them because they want Izumiko and Miyuki to side with the Souda Alliance against Takayanagi. Mostly just Izumiko, though.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/NGklGCC.jpg)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/5giRCsm.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/dg4fadL.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/B5eOZLi.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/IlvGWCy.png)~~~\n\nFirst of all, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s _literally_ an ambush. Secondly, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not how you go about trying to obtain somebody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s alliance. Thirdly, the Soudas were on friendly terms with them. I mean yeah, Izumiko and Miyuki basically voiced the opinion of wanting to stay out of the conflict, but\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 how did they think they would react to an ambush in the woods? It really comes off like the Soudas truly thought they weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t doing anything wrong.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/6HawedU.jpg)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/xvBtqCe.jpg)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/Wlbmewz.jpg)~~~\n\nAnd if the characters actually made rational and logical decisions in this series, Izumiko and Miyuki would immediately cut ties with the Souda Alliance because sure, Takanayagi made a computer explode in one of the Souda\u00e2\u0080\u0099s faces and summons ghosts, but the Soudas aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very good either, it seems.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/fPOuGMS.png)\n\nBecause later near the very end of the show, one or more of the Soudas are finally showing a bit of remorse or thought about their actions and he almost verbatim says \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaybe we should stop trying to take over the school.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/hw2u6vC.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/3kCxQU2.png)~~~\n\n...That was your primary goal? I thought it was to stop Takanayagi because quite frankly, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bit of an asshole, but the way it comes off is that they were gonna try and take over the school regardless and Takanayagi was just an obstacle that got in the way.\n\n...Actually, the more I think about it, I guess it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really just the female Souda I have problems with. Because also near the end of the show, she randomly floats to Miyuki the idea that they should have a fake political marriage for\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 some reason? \n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/3EOMGq8.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/JYdAluK.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/6qgimbO.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/uirjxc6.jpg)~~~\n\nIt really just completely came out of fucking nowhere. And like I just remembered a couple of episodes back where like she was in tears because she thought she was gonna lose her one remaining brother and end up alone.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/4T3ZaXe.png)\n\nBut now here she is having to be reminded by Miyuki that a fake marriage, while fake, would likely deeply hurt the people around them. Because you know, the Souda trio had said various things throughout the whole show like: \u00e2\u0080\u009cone day, we three will be one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d and etc. And like when the ghost brother tries to confess his love to Izumiko and is then rejected, he tells his sister sorry for cheating on her?\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/uyKc3No.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/FkSeccd.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/9Yn8VKv.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/odoNOQU.png)~~~\n\n...Is it still incest if the brother is dead and also possibly a magical CG ghost dragon? Is... is the implication here actually that the triplets love each other that way? Or are they talking about like some sort of spiritual love? Because yes even Izumiko makes a remark that Masumi's love is different to human love but was that what that was supposed to be? Because Masumi was gonna abandon his siblings to spend the rest of his existence with Izumiko in the\n\n~~~img50(https://i.imgur.com/Bp2eb0Q.jpg)~~~\n\n...So yeah to sum this section up, Red Data Girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quirky cast of characters are really just normal high school teens. Nothing strange about any of them at all\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 ha-ha\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\n___\n\n~~~img(https://i.imgur.com/ZlZNCrH.png)~~~\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just going to apologize in advance. As I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m actively making the decision that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just gonna let this section\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 be whatever it ends up being. I spend very little time in revising my reviews if at all, but I do tend to typically prefer for them to be orderly.\n\nBut as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made it very clear, I view the plot or the actual meat of the show to just be\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 complete and utter fucking nonsense. Like if I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even get clear character motivations, relationships to other characters, or goals then what in the hell am I supposed to hope for as far as plot goes?\n\nIt starts relatively sanely. Izumiko cuts her hair one day because she wants to change.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/pJR8jai.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/Pxd4lrk.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/lipDWO3.png)~~~\n\nFrom this point, this series could have went in any direction. ~~Miyuki is forced to transfer to be with Izumiko against his will and all that stuff happens.~~ But then it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quickly revealed that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something odd about Izumiko, and oh hey, one of Izumiko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s classmates is acting weird and oddly obsessive towards Izumiko.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/QG42lHv.png)\n\nWell, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in fact not a human being at all, but in fact a familiar who Izumiko subconsciously created and he wants to prevent Izumiko going to Tokyo with Miyuki so he and Miyuki fight and Miyuki wins and then that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s over and they go to Tokyo and Wamiya is gone for a good portion of the show until he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back as a crow and sometimes he can give Miyuki crow wings for some reason???\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/xgx4V3H.png)\n\nWith that arc being over and done they do in fact go to Tokyo and start going to high school but oh no the high school they are going to is crazy supernatural high school although there are apparently also normal people there too (???). Izumiko sees a guy but with her glasses off she sees him as a spooky shadow guy and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because it turns out he is in fact not a human being at all but an entity known as a spirit agent created by the guy running for student council president.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/n76d2LK.png)\n\nTakanayagi shows up irritated that his magic spy has been seen through and immediately pelts Izumiko with salt because he sees the truth of her identity. She is in fact the Red Data Girl the ancient legends speak of who is destined to rise up and bring the world to an end. \n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/YAVj3Gj.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/PVnutiF.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/gpSTkEJ.png)~~~\n\nShe will destroy all of technology and humanity shall sink into never ending despair as the time of the apocalypse approaches with every minute that passes the darkness will consume all the darkness the darkness the darkness\n\n~~~img100(https://i.imgur.com/Bp2eb0Q.jpg)~~~\n\nThe Soudas seek to oppose Takanayagi so when rumors of his weird fortune telling website spread throughout the school, female Souda seeks to investigate and it just happens that she is in fact a master hacker so she attempts to infiltrate the website mad hacker style but Takanayagi being a master of the digital world senses this so therefore causes the computer she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s using to explode in her face using his powers. \n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/F77Mbmj.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/bs7a0jC.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/kZH3qrH.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/TJ8mpsE.png)~~~\n\nBeing trounced and having her hacker skills put to shame infuriates her brother so he goes to claim vengeance upon Takanayagi.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/xPpHQWo.png)~~~\n\nThen they proceed to the Souda homeland and the Soudas attempt to earn the allegiance of Izumiko and Miyuki by attacking them in the woods and then the living male Souda learns that his horse is in dire straits and immediately leaves, for he decided that the fate of his horse is far more important than his sister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bullshit. \n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/9UYOWQ2.jpg)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/p79kPvM.png)~~~\n\nYes, the horse is the key to all of this. We can save the universe from the Red Data Girl as long as we have the horse and its mystical powers to curb the coming apocalypse.\n\nBut unfortunately the horse flatlines. \n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/bCP48mR.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/rmb1nxd.png)~~~\n\nIt is dead. __The horse is dead.__ ___THE HORSE IS DEAD. THIS TIMELINE IS DOOME___\n\n~~~img100(https://i.imgur.com/Bp2eb0Q.jpg)~~~\n\nThe living male Souda falls into depression and states that his horse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death has made him realized that they are all going to die one day. And if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to die one day anyways, he may as well as go _right now._ \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/LfvMy3v.png)\n\nHe mounts the ghost of his now dead horse and rides off to another plane of existence where he plans on abandoning his sister once and for all to hang out with his dead brother for the rest of existence.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/EYh89wf.png)\n\nBut the Red Data Girl cannot have this. The Soudas are integral to the plot. The balance shall be overthrown if one of them are gone, so Izumiko and Miyuki depart to forcibly drag the living Souda back to reality. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revealed that Masumi is a magical spiritual CG dragon and he wishes to take the place of living Souda for being dead sucks apparently. They must contain the dragon if they wish to escape in one piece.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/NzyMM8q.jpg)\n\nThankfully, Red Data _Woman_ arrives possessed by the Goddess and contains the CG dragon and they escape with their lives intact. The Souda homeland arc has truly been one of the most important stretches of the show and surely will play an important impact on the rest of the events to\n\n~~~img100(https://i.imgur.com/Bp2eb0Q.jpg)~~~\n\nNext up, the Goddess reveals to Miyuki after possessing Izumiko that she is in fact not actually a Goddess at all. No, in actuality, the Goddess is a dead human that is possessing Izumiko from beyond the grave, bypassing the boundaries of time itself. Or\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 something?\n\n img440(https://i.imgur.com/Y5R1TMF.png)\n\nI guess she could just be meaning all the different people she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possessed over the years but\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 no she definitely mentions destroying humanity once? \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/gcCcxey.png)\n\nThen another time she was caught and was experimented by a secret society of scientist goblins?\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/t1T700T.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/iL3j2rA.png)~~~\n\nWhat? What the fuck is this seri\n\n~~~img200(https://i.imgur.com/Bp2eb0Q.jpg)~~~\n\nBut hey it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cool because at the end Izumiko arrives at the revelation that the entire show has gradually been steering her towards and what everything has been building up to the whole time and totally wasn't just another link in a chain of nonsense. She is in fact not being possessed AT ALL throughout the entire series. She is the Goddess herself. She IS the Red Data Girl herself.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/nIeXBHS.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/BT1JOYa.png)~~~\n\nBut... wait. Huh? No, that can't be right. The Goddess is still like its own... thing, right? Like sure Takanayagi made her mad and she finally used the Goddess' powers on her own without being possessed by her, but, that doesn't disprove the Goddess' existence right? But wouldn't her being able to use her powers mean that yeah she's fully become the Goddess???\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/vspQvol.png)\n\nActually, hold the fuck on here, it's the final episode and the show just like fully went back to the school festival and Takanayagi vs Souda but like... WHAT ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE GODDESS IS TIME TRAVELING? OR THAT SHE'S JUST A DEAD HUMAN? THAT WAS JUST THREW OUT THERE SO CASUALLY AND IT'S KIND OF HUGE WHY HAVEN'T WE EXPANDED ON ANY OF THAT???\n\n___SHE SAID SHE'S DESTROYED HUMANITY ONCE.___ WHY ARE WE FOCUSING ON THIS STUPID GODDAMNED FESTIVAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n\n~~~img250(https://i.imgur.com/Bp2eb0Q.jpg)~~~\n\nNone... none of this makes any sense...\n\nHey\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 \n\n~~~img500(https://i.imgur.com/Bp2eb0Q.jpg)~~~\n\n#Hey!#\n\n~~~img(https://i.imgur.com/Bp2eb0Q.jpg)~~~\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/SnyLvMH.png)~~~\n\n~~~img(https://i.imgur.com/SUfJulN.gif)~~~\n\nThis doesn't make any sense.

Oh, yes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the review. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already at the conclusion! It feels like I only sat down to write the review just a moment ago. Blue Data Girl is not a very good series. What little fun supernatural stuff there is is undercut by how much of a boring slog the rest of the series is. You just want the Goddess to take over Izumiko already and the Souda siblings to just get off of the screen.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/vhsN2zQ.png)\n\nSo much time was put into that stupid goddamned rivalry between the Soudas and Takanayagi and the Soudas didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even really do anything to best him. No, Izumiko gets angry and literally turns him into a dog, and then the adult magicians show up to handle the ghost army or something. And like yeah maybe I would have cared about Miyuki bravely taking on ghosts in another plane of existence to try and drag Izumiko back to the physical world if there had been more to their relationship.\n\nIt starts out with them hating each other, then Miyuki begrudgingly having to do all of the action shit, and then them both being annoyed or frustrated with each other but they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just fucking talk to each other to resolve it. Miyuki wants Izumiko to actually rely on him and Izumiko is fucking terrified of the entity that can destroy humanity within her and that Miyuki is just serving her rather than Izumiko.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/Z2LlktF.png)\n\nAnd of course, since this is an adaptation of a novel series, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no conclusion. Just a flat out hint at a continuation that would have led into the next novel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s events that obviously never came. Miyuki and Izumiko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship never reaches the point the opening just immediately gives away, the Souda vs Takanayagi thing is never fully resolved, and I guess Izumiko's accepted that she's the goddess but _The Goddess_ may still end up taking her over one day and destroying humanity...???\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/EFExAED.png)\n\nBoring as all hell, nonsensical, and whatever the plot was never is satisfactorily completed. I give Blue Data Girl a __10 out of 100__. And similar to its younger P.A. Works sibling Glasslip, I would say this is another show I can really only recommend to fellow masochists or those who wish to watch every single P.A. Works series.\n\nGoodbye!

Each one has different cast of characters and theme to it.\nFirst part focuses on a boy called Xiao Ming, this tale shows us just how powerful edible produce can be.\nSecond part is about two sisters, Y Lin and Lulu, as they venture into the world of fashion. One wants to become a clothes designer and the other wants to stay a popular model.\nLast part is a tale of love. A young lad, Limo, digs out an old player and remembers his childhood with this gal.\n\n...Yeah thats all I can pretty much summarise for this, there really isn't much memorable or worth exploring deeper. Each story does have a deeper meaning for sure but its just not as impactful as the other stories I've seen.\nThis is one of the reason I rated this show so low. It doesn't really go out of its way to engage you, it just exists.\n~~~img420(https://66.media.tumblr.com/cead466837ad84f1f4513298f5eb5165/tumblr_pdc3hv4wu11v6bs4yo4_500.gif)~~~\n<br>\n\n\n[**CHARACTERS:**]()\nThe characters present in this movie were quite bland. They really aren't that memorable.\nThey really felt like some placeholders in a show, just there to fill in that arc. Not what I'd call main characters.\nThis is the second reason why this movie is rated so low for me, there is no one I can look back on and think \"wow, I really liked how they did this\".\n~~~img420(https://78.media.tumblr.com/b3f496f2f1c84fbc1bed28fd45bb1618/tumblr_pda4meIyhm1rz9hl6o6_r1_540.gif)~~~\n<br>\n\n\n[**ART/ANIMATION:**]()\nVisually this movie isn't bad. Its actually quite good, which is to be expected from the people who made \"Your name.\"\nThe animation is smooth, the artstyle is gorgeous. The colour palette is quite bright most of the time, especially when happy memories are shown. This gives off the impression that the happy times are over and now we have to deal with the sad present, this is especially apparent in the last part of the movie (Shanghai Koi).\n~~~img420(https://66.media.tumblr.com/a2a75d5476d38778e53625d6613194c1/tumblr_pd9dpyTpZY1tndn6wo1_500.gif)~~~\n<br>\n\n\n[**MUSIC:**]()\nThe music. It was interesting enough to make me watch more of the movie. Though that being said it was nothing that special.\nIt did fit the mood found in the scene shown but not much beyond that.

After a while, he defeats an army of 200.000 orcs and hires them to build an even bigger city in his territory, the Jura Forest.\nWith the blessing of driads, who care and should defend the woodland, Rimuru's little town becomes a Capital. But now let's see some plotholes:\n- How could a town of fifty goblins and some Ogres sustain a so wild immigration (200k orcs, remember) without collapsing to a starving favela?\n- How could Rimuru assure safety and salaries to 200k new citizien without a stable economy and without any local currency? Remember goblins used to bargain and hunt in the wood.\n- Why did driads accept the destruction of the forest in order to take resources for the city's expansion?\n- Why does everyone love to suck slime's d***?\n\n\n CHARACTERS: 4/10\nhere's the tipical meeting between Rimuru and others:\n Person: \"Oh, a stupid slime is blocking my path, prepare to die!\"\n _Rimuru farts at their general direction_\n Person: \"Please accept my oath, Rimuru-sama!\"\n\nReally, they're all so generic: there's the quiet edgy ninja, the arrogant prince felt in disgrace, the little princess in distress, 2 goofy side-character meant to be laught at (Gabil and Gobta), the super buffed, prideful ruler that  all he does in order to make alliances which will define the future of his kingdom is brawls, a wise but weak ruler, and then... you know...\n\nF A N S E R V I C E\n\nI mean, tons and tons of fan service. I'm not against it, but damn, there're characters who would be easily fogotten if they didn't have great Oppais (Shion). All this takes me to give a low vote to the characterization.\n\nARTS AND EFFECTS: 6.5/10\naverage effects, there's some lame cgi (Orcs army was almost like the Goblin Army from Overlord 3), but overall is acceptable. at least Oppais are always bouncing and clothes' movement are well animated.\n\nMUSIC and OST: 6.5/10\nnothing incredible, the op are discrete, and the there're some (ripetitive) ost that just works.\n\n\nOVERALL: 4.5/10\nIs your time worthless? Even if that case, I don't suggest to spend time watching this anime.\n\nNonick96"}, {"id": 4232, "score": 33, "body": "Fanservice is weird in that at some point during it's history, it went from titillating people with the possibility of seeing some skin, to having weird and bizarre situations where trying to cover up said skin has become half the appeal. And while Eiken is nowhere the near the weirdest fanservice out there, it's has become a tad infamous in certain anime circles.\n\nOur main character is Densuke, who has just enrolled at the exclusive Zashono Academy, a very large private school with 54,00 students ranging from elementary to junior to high school. This school is also know for it's large range of club activities. And as the anime is starting and dumping all of this information on you, the fanservice starts. As Densuke arrives, he falls into, or onto, one of these clubs depending on how you view it, the titular Eiken club, by falling on one of his classmate's, Chiharu Shinonome, enormous breasts. And when I say enormous, I mean fucking gigantic.\n\nEvery single woman has boobs with a size any where from beach balls to a hot air balloons. Eiken is pronounced achin', short for aching, because that's what the women's backs are definitely doing with the size of their knockers. But none of the women even show the slightest hint of back pain, or even having to try to deal with their massive size of their tits. Maybe the gravity on this planet is completely different and significantly less than of our Earth's, and to compensate, all of the women have giant tits to keep them from floating off into space, along with the men all being as dense as a collapsing star.\n\nBut moving on to actual plot of this series, this anime's excuse of getting the girls out of there clothing is that the main character has to get money to buy another character a gift to make up for accidentally embarrassing her. To get the money, he joins the school's games, which includes games like going down a comically over-complex giant slide with his female team mates in revealing clothing, but instead of water, it's yogurt trying it's damnedest to look like semen.\n\nThere's even a character that comes along that appears to be trying to win over and steal the main characters love interest. But this matters so little and is so what this OVA is trying to do that the character isn't even worth mentioning.\n\nWhile it's not the worst or even the most baffling thing out there, it's definitely a sight to behold, and is definitely going to get a double take out of a lot of people."}, {"id": 4236, "score": 10, "body": "\"Shuumatsu Nani Shitemasu ka? Isogashii desu ka?

They left out, unfortunately, the main characters growth, though. The characters did not \"evolve\" much and there wasn't really a chance getting to know them, which left a great divide between me and the characters. When it came to Chtholly, you didn't get much of a chance to get to know her at all, either. The death-flag came way too early and made it more of a journy to see how she would die, or what her last moments would be like.\nNeither did the other characters get much screen time, which made it hard to feel for them. The anime (and story) felt really rushed and not to my satisfaction.\n\nBecause of how early they introduced the death-flag, it was hard to connect with Chtholly. Since it was so early on, it felt like I was just watching to watch. Not to get engaged in the relationship between the main characters. I mean, there wasn't much of a relationship to begin with. The writer of the story seem to like unhappy endings (from what I've read on forums, about after-the-anime-timeline). This is why I can't help but feel like that the feelings they were trying to get at, at the end, wasn't earned. They ripped the rug from under my feet way too quickly, hence; I cannot praise its ending. I can't think anything other than \"oh, so this is the direction they are going to take throughout the entire story? Just a bunch of let-downs and bad endings? Why should I then invest with my time and emotions?\"\nNeither is the story well written enough to engage me to begin with, which become more like \"here, take my middle finger instead.\" Like, they really wanted to solidify the idea that Chtholly is not coming back in any way, since reincarnation (which is a thing in this story) is not possible, because of what happened in the end.\n\nIf it would have ended on more happier note, I would probably like it a bit more, but as said, the way the story and characters were written; it wouldn't have made too much of a difference.\nIt would have been nicer if they fleshed out the story a bit more so that it would have turned in to a 20+ episodes anime and not just 12. Of course, it would mean that the writers would have had to flesh out the story a bit more and drag it out, but in this story it would have been a good thing."}, {"id": 4242, "score": 45, "body": "__Story__: B the Beginning has a very messy and predictable narrative. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the equivalent of watching a whole bunch of tropes being thrown at a script to see which resonate with the audience. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even begin to dive into just how generic this whole plot is. It couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be more tired and stale if it tried. From the beginning the pacing felt completely off, the story coming at you all at once and then going at a snails pace to try and catch the audience up with its nonsense. Dialogue held your hand throughout the narrative. It felt as if the writers didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the confidence that their audience would understand everything they were going for if it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spoon fed to them. Minutes would be spent on exposition dumps from characters about nonsensical details that the story would touch upon later on, making these monologues feel repetitive and unnecessary. None of the emotional reactions the writers may have been expecting were earned. Comedic scenes felt out of place and awkward, empathetic moments felt shallow, and reveals always fell flat due to a painfully predictable pattern in the writing of the twists and turns. \n\n__Sound/Music__: The OP is rather short but I have to say it worked for what it was. Simple, short and elegant. As for the ED it was honestly the highlight of my experience with this show. I never skipped listening to it since it matched so well with the visuals of the closing sequence. Feels far too good for a show like this. The music during the fighting sequences was alright, nothing too outstanding. The voice acting for the most part was adequate. \n\n__Animation__: Wasted. Production IG has talented staff but the direction of this show was uncoordinated and incompetent. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know who thought the floating words indicating clues was a good idea. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s distracting and stylistically unnecessary. We can hear the characters describing clues as words crowd the screen and is unappealing to look at. Character designs are generic, each character looking exactly as you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d expect their archetype to look. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boring. And these characters are just as forgettable in personality. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so frustrating because there are moments that the animation does shine through. Fighting sequences look nice, especially when they take the time to slow down the movements. There is some effort in bringing this world to life in the environments, with some nice details in some establishing shots. However, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not enough to carry this story and its characters. \n\nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even recommend giving this show a passing glance. There are much better shows out there that are worth your time. "}, {"id": 4246, "score": 30, "body": "It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s amazing that we can put a man on the moon but anime like this still somehow get made. Basically, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a poorly done student project that had someone with clout and money releasing it out of charity in commemorating Tatsunoko Production\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anniversary\u00e2\u0080\u0094some tribute this turned out to be since it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so completely devoid of wit, style, intelligence or basic entertainment value that it makes Aldnoah.Zero seem like a purely artistic statement by comparison. Egao no Daika (The Price of smiles in English) seems above all abashed, embarrassed: It knows something has to change, but it can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change anything. There is an awareness pulsing throughout each episode, as it pulses through our lives, that so much of what once seemed like progress was the opposite of progress, that our dreams of a better tomorrow were always leading them to a miserable today.\n\nThe story is the kind that takes two steps forward and ten steps back, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re constantly finding yourself trying to make sense of things that you soon discover to be void of logic, to begin with. The Price of Smiles is a big high-concept mecha-filled exploration of war themes gone wrong, with the most absurd depiction of politics, because what else could you expect when mixing all of that with aloof cute girls? They constantly clash with each other and there is hardly any meaningful theme exploration to make it matter. You have your average cute girls react to the \"atrocities\" of war, a war which you see too little to really care about. Ironically, the biggest issue this show suffers from is that there is no war in an anime about war. While you do get to see some action, but the actual war and the epic battles that happen are canonically told. Picture this scenario: The characters are on a skirmish prior to a big battle near a city or a key location. The skirmish ends. Our characters retreat to heal and get ammo\u00e2\u0080\u0094and then it cuts abruptly to after the big battle. This happens so often that you really feel scammed. \"Oh, the big city fell to the enemy!\", \"Oh, we were ambushed last night and lost two carriers!\" You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually get to see it happening.\n\nThe flip-flopping story wouldn't be so bad if you could actually sympathize with both sides, and this is thanks to how it was poorly structured from the beginning where you will naturally side with Soleil. But the way the show is portraying the characters, it clearly wants us to sympathize more with the Empire soldiers, even though at the higher story level there is no reason to do so. It ends up adding pointless confusion and dissonance to the emotional core of the story. They don't show enough regret or disdain for their actions either, so why should the audience forgive them? If they wanted us to actually like these people, they would have presented a credible reason for their invasion. Some secret atrocity committed by Soleil, or show the desolate state of their country due to sanctions etc. The characters are awfully bad, they lack intelligence, characterization, development, personality, and simple logic. Simply one-dimensional and unrelatable\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially the main protagonist in Yuuki Soleil.\n\nAnd speaking of Yuuki, she is a profoundly unlikable brat who is very clearly directly responsible for their setbacks while the competent commanders struggle to win a war with an idealistic idiot in charge who does nothing to actually attempt to implement her ideas and spends most of the day crying. She's a perfect example of why you don't put children in charge of your army. The first episode sets up that she is a competent tactician\u00e2\u0080\u0094and then we never see any indication of this ever again. She has no real plan to win the war besides Deus Ex Machina. Throughout the show, you get to witness her grand scheme of preventing casualties which happen anyway. She repeatedly gives orders and people tell her that would be a bad idea and she immediately retracts them. Her reasoning is not just childish, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that of a hippie, and we all know that hippies never prevented or ended wars. She should have abdicated her role in commanding troops to those more competent at the job, and the generals should have had her deposed long ago, and it makes their side appear stupid to continue listening to her. A real peace monger has to convince the people, not just disappear with the weapons, along with every other advancement that their civilization made, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another can of worms.\n\nAnd when you think it couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get any worse, The Price of Smiles production team butchered everything in the visual department. You have bland character designs, barely any effort in detailing the background art, poor animation throughout, and then, everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favorite\u00e2\u0080\u0094PlayStation 2 like CG graphics for the large scale mecha action sequences. Not only is the CG horrendous but the cinematography is worse, poorly framed to such levels where it's hard to make out of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening on screen. A huge load of cheap tricks and shortcuts are jarringly noticeable. The soundtrack is forgettable, sometimes non-existent with the only saving grace being the voice actors. Somehow, they managed to pick up some talent but when you have a subpar script, there not much that these voice actors can do to make these characters feel like real people, to make them at least interesting.\n\nThere is just no way that I would recommend this show, even things such as the strategy \"guerrilla\" warfare are barely seen within 12 episodes that makes it even harder to call it a real war anime. Terrible plot and unbelievable politics. Watching people tap on computers, act like assholes towards each other, and make a useless princess cry (she cries all the damn time) isn't really exciting. The price you pay for watching this? Wasting your time! It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good to know that, if we have to leave Earth someday, we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to go without our kitsch. Forensics experts will be digging through the rubble of this fiasco for a long time, trying to reconstruct the accident. How did the story become so ridiculous? Why create a war anime with a cute girl ruling a country and its army? Why were the action scenes so disappointing and unconvincing? Who put the stink on this? The Price of Smiles is a wolf in sheep's clothing, a poor excuse for a war mecha story is nothing more than another piece of seasonal anime trash that panders to moe-loving otaku.\n"}, {"id": 4250, "score": 25, "body": "I do not understand why such wasteful shows like this one were made, much less allowed to exist.\nAfter what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen here, I think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve just about had it with these so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cseasonal fillers\u00e2\u0080\u009d. This show just really gets me perplexed on so many levels that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not even funny. From what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been told, this show, Egao No Daika (The Price of Smiles), was actually produced to commemorate the 55th anniversary of its producer Tatsunoko Productions, the very same studio that actually contributed to the likes of Neon Genesis Evangelion, Ping Pong The Animation, and the OG Macross series. However, this production, meant as a tribute to the long-running studio, wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a very happy anniversary, to say the least. It just seemed like the show just failed on the most basic levels.\n\nSTORY:\nSo what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the story? Egao no Daika introduces us to an interplanetary (or interstellar) setting, focusing on the perspectives of the two main heroines: a princess named Yuuki Soleil, and a soldier named Stella Shining, both born and living on two distant planets that are apparently at war with each other. The kind of progression that this story takes is like constantly shooting yourself in the ACL with every step forward you take, and from the recoil, you take several steps backward and fall on your ass. There doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to be any sense of direction; the show tries to implements all these concepts of war, politics, and mechas to make itself look professional, but its depiction of those themes and/or concepts are amateur level at best, if not idiotic. \nIn this \u00e2\u0080\u009cwar\u00e2\u0080\u009d, the two sides are just constantly clashing for practically no good reason, and at no point during the entirety of the show was there any engaging exposition or exploration as to why they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re butting heads in the first place. This show literally runs on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cat least 1 death per episode\u00e2\u0080\u009d strategy and our main girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exaggerated reactions of shock and/or horror to these imageries of the atrocities of war, which really gets painfully exasperated and repetitive with each progressing episode. This was obviously meant to be used as shock value as an excuse and as compensation for the abysmal structuring of the plot and setting of this series. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s funny is that while this IS a show about war, there barely any imagery of actual war to be seen\u00e2\u0080\u00a6just pre-battle skirmishes here and there that somehow result in some \u00e2\u0080\u009cboohoo oh so tragic\u00e2\u0080\u009d death(s). The actual big battles we only know of via character dialogue, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re basically fast-forwarded to the events AFTER they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already took place. It honestly felt like being cheated out of a multi-million dollar lottery where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve spend almost a fortune on just the ticket itself beforehand.\nThe constant shifting between the two sides\u00e2\u0080\u0099 perspectives honestly isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that awful. The problem is that there is really no reason to try to sympathize for either group. By default, we should\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been siding with Yuuki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side, the Empire, but the extremely abysmal portrayal of the characters really denies that option. Many of their actions are just selfish, and they show absolutely no regret or disdain for what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done. Why in the name of God should I even give a sliver of sympathy to such foolery? If this show wanted us to care for these guys, there should\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been deep exposition and exploration as to why this war even started in the first place, as stated earlier.\n\nI really have to place the blame on the facts that the show dared to place the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccute girl fanservice\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the forefront for everyone to see. I personally don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a problem with female leads, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found a recurring problem with this, and I have sort of a theory regarding this. Apparently when the Japanese anime industry produces shows with female protagonists as the main lead, they seem to bank on the hopes that the imagery of feminine main characters as the main attraction in the show for the viewers will divert their collective attention away from potentially mediocre to bad storytelling, characterization, and showcasing of important themes and concepts. This is NOT how you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supposed to write a damn story, much less produce a TV show! That being said, there ARE many actual good shows with female leads, so at least the trick isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a complete scam.\n\nANIMATION:\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be honest here. I actually didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think the animation was that bad. Well, at the very least, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think the 2D animation was that bad. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen far worse examples. The 2D is just kinda mediocre, and if this wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trying to be some military space mecha chimera of a show, the designs of the characters and the background settings I would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been perfectly fine with. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like I was expecting some Shaft, KyoAni, or Madhouse levels of awesomeness, anyway.\nAs for the CG graphics, it felt like one of those mecha games you play on Xbox or Playstation, but on a very amateur level. The movements are clearly jarring and awkward, so much so to the point where the show often tries to \u00e2\u0080\u009cjump-cutting\u00e2\u0080\u009d through them to try to lessen the focused attention on the poorly framed images\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.only to just make the displaying of the fights even worse. This level of atrocity in the 3D here are only surpassed by the likes of Berserk, Alice to Zouroku, and the extremely infamous hellspawn known as Hand Shakers. \n\nSOUND:\nOkay. The opening theme, I get it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very beautiful. I actually REALLY like, if not LOVE, this opening theme. In fact, for me, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something where I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d sit back and listen to it on loop for at least 10-20 minutes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEgao no Kanata\u00e2\u0080\u009d seems to be somewhat of a duet with lots of violin and piano music, with some drums-and-cymbals action; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s filled with a lot of bittersweet emotion, where the lyrics seem to cry out or lament the pain of war and the difficulty of trying to physically display happiness (in short\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.smile), while still giving a sense of hope and wishes to balance out the negative emotions.  This would perfectly fit the title of the show and the opening visuals in which the theme is played. An extremely lonely bright spot in a literal dumpster fire of a show.\nThe rest of the soundtracks are not really that memorable, in all honesty. The ending theme \"Kono Sekai ni Hanataba wo\u00e2\u0080\u009d is simply underwhelming compared to the OP. The voice acting is quite mediocre as well, and I really blame the terribly produced scripts for that. The performance of the VAs is kinda bipolar in nature, from practically emotionless dry dialogue to overcooked overly dramatic screaming and shouting. At least the show let me know when I have to cover my delicate ears when the latter happens.\n\nCHARACTERS:\nOh boy, the characters. This show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s selection of characters was as if someone skipped a bunch of steps in a chocolate chip cookie recipe, which included the blasphemy of not even adding chocolate chips! For the most part, they are literally cookie-cut, copy-pasta, one-dimensional husks, especially the recurring support characters. Now they did have the potential to be likeable enough to not be viewed in that way, but due to the way the story is portrayed and how the character dynamics are, or how there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an evident lack of that, it is practically impossible to even like or relate to them. At the very least, the support characters were allowed to have their backstories told to give some sort of structure, but ultimately, that was a desperate attempt to make us to suddenly sympathize for them when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re mostly just fodder for those \u00e2\u0080\u009c1 death per episode\u00e2\u0080\u009d shock value shenanigans. I sure ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t one that easily buys into shock value, to say the least. \n\nFor example, Joshua Ingram, a member from the Empire and the Princess\u00e2\u0080\u0099s male bestie, seems like a very promising character because of his very optimistic personality. Two episodes in, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s killed off and the Princess literally becomes Shinji Ikari (or maybe Tatsuhiro Satou?) for a moment with her overplayed reaction to his \u00e2\u0080\u009clivestreamed\u00e2\u0080\u009d death\u00e2\u0080\u00a6..like seriously, crack staff? Really? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll digress\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\nNow for the two female leads:\n\nThe Princess, Yuuki Soleil, is very incompetent, hesitant, and unlikable as a main character. She is directly responsible for her country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s setbacks, which offsets her competent subordinates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efforts to do things right and to win the war. She can talk the talk, but can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t walk the walk, and practically spends most of the time crying or trying to comfort the family of someone who recently died due to her absolute uselessness. In all fairness, she should never in charge in the first place, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really know why she was just dropped into this central role in the first place. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as if the show wants to utilize the reactions of a character like her to elicit some sort of emotional response from the viewers whenever someone dies. Instead, her reactions just come off as quite obnoxious and revolting. While she is not completely dumb, as she does tactical abilities, she simply just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do the appropriate actions to execute whatever plans she suggests. She also backs off too easily when the people tell her that her ideas are too risky or unrealistic. The way she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s somehow allowed to conduct herself and keep her position really amazes me in a bad way; in all honesty, she should be relieved of her role, but alas that never happens, and it just makes her side look like a bunch of idiots as well. The only thing that bails her out in the end is some unwarranted \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeus ex\u00e2\u0080\u009d plot device to ultimately end the war in the most underwhelming of ways possible.\n\nStella Shining is an interesting but ultimately wasted potential of a character. Apparently, she seems to try to smile whenever possible, due to the rather rough background she is given. However, her superficial smiles hide an unstable side of her, because while smiles are supposed to portray the feelings of optimism, her smiles have an ominous feel to them, which is pretty much linked to the fact that she is willing to kill even children if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deemed necessary. I wanted to feel sympathy for Stella, cause I do view her as someone \u00e2\u0080\u009cbroken\u00e2\u0080\u009d and having lost something dear to her, like with the case of the titular character in Violet Evergarden, but as the story progressed, she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t to really get any sort of notable character development until the very end. So I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m basically forced to view her as a pseudo-Mary Sue for the majority of the show, and hence the damage was already done, if it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t already by that bratty Princess. And oh yeah, she can apparently do the overdramatic reactions to someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death as well, apparently\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.smh.\n\nThe one thing I did hope for when I was watching this show, based on what I saw from the visuals, was for Yuuki and Stella to have a chance encounter and foster a \u00e2\u0080\u009cprince-and-pauper\u00e2\u0080\u009d-like relationship, where they would often meet in secret, have fun playing, and talk about each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side of their stories; this would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve really helped with their character dynamics as well as their maturation as human beings. From these developments, they would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been able to move their people and find a realistic way to end the war, with properly driven emotions. Alas, it was never the case, as they only meet face-to-face in the final episode, and suddenly become good friends after the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwar\u00e2\u0080\u009d ends. Tis quite a shame\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.\n\nENJOYMENT:\nWatching this show was just frustrating and felt very much like a chore, for the most part. Believe me\u00e2\u0080\u00a6I wanted to like this show\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.I really did. But due to the constant problems already mentioned above, I came to gradually scorn the show, and by all means, I could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve easily dropped it if it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for my completionist mindset. On the bright side, I could never bring myself to skip the opening theme, as it is quite the catchy anime opening tune that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love to make an AMV with in some time from now.\nEgao no Daika was simply a poorly made batch of cookies that could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve used a two-cour format if the producers were actually serious about making an actual good show. Considering it IS a tribute to the 55th anniversary to Tatsunoko Productions, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see any reason why they should not at least put actual effort into making this show actually good, actually something that can attract the masses and not be just another useless \u00e2\u0080\u009cseasonal filler\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Unfortunately, mistakes were made, big ones at that, resulting in a crapfest that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mediocre at most. \n\nIf you want something of similar premises, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re better off watching Aldnoah Zero or the elitist favorite Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu (Legend of the Galactic Heroes). While I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not exactly a fan of those two shows I mentioned, they display similar premises and war themes, but in a far, far better way, and have more competent cast of characters; Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu, in particular, shines in its ability to have adequate exposition and exploration into the politics and the war strategies. Go and try out those two, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother with this apeshit soap opera right here.\n"}, {"id": 4254, "score": 37, "body": "__My Girlfriend is ShoBitch__, that may be true in this animes case, but she is also boring and non-exciting to the viewer watching this show. They try and use every cliche in ecchi means whilst trying to make everything into a joke about sex. For a virgin, the protagonists know quite a lot about sex. The art style has no specialty to it unlike other animes and seems very bad compared to some other animes that came out during the 2017 fall animes. For consisting of only 10 episodes and 1 ova, it did happen to make me laugh a few times, so that is a given and deserves some credit for it's comedy genre that was correct in it's placement. In the ova they decided to say, \"Fuck it!\" and put in the nudity scene, where you'd expect the original series would be filled with, it was quite boring and I couldn't stop checking the time of the video every two minutes to see when the episode would finally end. My Girlfriend is Shobitch is okay, it is not good, nor bad. It is one of your normal animes who try to copy a better version of its self. _I would rather you watch Shimoneta then this mediocre anime._\n\nThis anime repeats jokes over the course of ten minutes so much that it got very dull. They made the joke about being a masochist four times at least and the joke about the main boy being a lolicon pedo several other times. They keep repeating an repeating, trying to get a laugh out of it's audience. As every other high school rom-com out there, the story starts as an ordinary high school boy,a trope used way to much that whenever I see those four words I sigh and get ready for a possible shit-show. Shobitch's romance wasn't the best, but definitely was not bad, it was a little less then okay. The ecchiness wasn't that very good either...The characters and plot weren't very original either, a normal high school boy, a foreign exchange student, a little sister who adores her older brother, a childhood friend who his so close to the male protagonist they call her by family formalities and not by their actual name. The shows highlight was the red-haired male, he seemed to be your ordinary (gay?) male that is the protagonist helpful buddy in romance. But he brings more comedy to the table then the main boy did. _All in all, My Girlfriend is a Faithful Virgin Bitch, but is not a Faithful Anime._ You either enjoy or dislike it, there is no middle grounds for this show. \n                                                                                                    \n                                  - Boner~Kun\n                                                                                                   "}, {"id": 4268, "score": 30, "body": "J\u00c3\u00a1 que esse \u00c3\u00a9 um anime menos popular do que os que eu tendo a fazer review.

Stella \u00c3\u00a9 uma \u00c3\u00b3rf\u00c3\u00a3 de guerra, que foi endurecida pelas dificuldades da vida. Mas ainda existe, em seu \u00c3\u00a2mago, um resqu\u00c3\u00adcio de sentimentos, presos ao passado. No entanto, a s\u00c3\u00a9rie n\u00c3\u00a3o tem tempo para realmente trabalhar essa personagem al\u00c3\u00a9m desse rabisco inicial. No m\u00c3\u00a1ximo temos alguns breves momentos em que ela sorri ou chora, mas sem grandes catarses. O mesmo vale para a Yuuki, confrontada com a morte de seu melhor amigo e quebra de sua redoma. Acreditei que seria nesse momento em que a personagem seria obrigada a crescer, a deixar a infantilidade de lado. Mas nada disso acontece e ela permanece exatamente como come\u00c3\u00a7ou, guerra \u00c3\u00a9 ruim, matar \u00c3\u00a9 errado.\n\nIsso me tr\u00c3\u00a1s a ideia base da narrativa de Price of Smiles. Tratar sobre a guerra e seus horrores. Existem dois problemas nessa abordagem. O primeiro \u00c3\u00a9 como ele \u00c3\u00a9 feito de maneira rasa, o anime nunca trabalha al\u00c3\u00a9m de \u00e2\u0080\u009cguerra \u00c3\u00a9 ruim\u00e2\u0080\u009d e \u00e2\u0080\u009ctodos na guerra s\u00c3\u00a3o humanos\u00e2\u0080\u009d, uma tem\u00c3\u00a1tica absolutamente lugar comum nos animes de mecha.\n\nPrincipalmente quando o primeiro \u00c3\u00a9 tratado com uma resolu\u00c3\u00a7\u00c3\u00a3o infantil de t\u00c3\u00a3o simpl\u00c3\u00b3ria, com nenhuma justificativa durante todos os outros epis\u00c3\u00b3dios. \u00c3\u0089 um grande poder do amor, mesmo que tudo que nos foi exposto era uma sociedade movida pelo \u00c3\u00b3dio do outro, pelo menos por parte dos militares.\n\nO que me tr\u00c3\u00a1s a segunda metade da mensagem \u00e2\u0080\u009ctodos na guerra s\u00c3\u00a3o humanos\u00e2\u0080\u009d, esse conceito, por mais que certo, carrega um problema em si. A falsa simetria de Prince of Smiles. Quero dizer, \u00c3\u00a9 s\u00c3\u00b3 olhar para as protagonistas dessa hist\u00c3\u00b3ria, uma princesa e uma soldado. Nota a diferen\u00c3\u00a7a?

Ex. it's about atheism and being free from religion, but what made sense in the world of the movie? what is the death egg purpose? what about the creatures in the egg-trees? what was in the angel's egg? what was really the soldier's purpose? it's not really made sure what was the conflict in the movie, or if there was a villain. You're left with symbols that aren't strictly defining, and can be frustrating, along with how long they drag out beautiful pictures for so long. All these previous things makes it hard to concrete things into meaning. I would say a commentary over this movie would be very eyeopening, it would call out a lot of bullshit that directors pull and try to force on the audience to try and figure out while shifting blame on them for \"not getting it,\" like the Prometheus commentary. I would say if you want to watch this, please do not watch at 1X speed, maybe 1.25x-1.5x and hopefully that makes it have better pacing, but even that is prone to problems for what things happen in the movie. \nThis movie suffers from what many short films do,(and judging but how long they dragged their feet in the movie they tried really hard to hit that 71 minute mark) they make appealing environments,(sound, imaging, art,) in place of dialog and story, to come off as nuanced and meaningful, whether it is or not. It's like that trick of not telling a message so you have to come up with a solution yourself, and once you piece it, you feel better.Take for example, One Small Step, they spare you the dialog for nice visuals and music, to seem meaningful in a meaning that has already been told many times, and is nothing new, it just invokes an emotional response, however more straight forward than Angel's Egg. Really, Angel's egg is not a masterpiece and doesn't deserve a rating of 10 ever, and it's purpose as a movie seemed to be the same purpose of One Small step; to showcase art and animation and what they can accomplish visually, but not what they can accomplish in clever storytelling."}, {"id": 4282, "score": 11, "body": "\"Spoiler alert\" \"NFSW alert\"\n\nWhen i started this manga that i binged in only like 15 minutes, i knew i was going to suffer, but i didnt know i was going to suffer to this point. This manga is a blatant ripoff of Highschool of dead, but with none of the qualities Highschool of the dead had. It has no tensions, it's just ridiculous. The worms killed me, when i saw them i was like \"Ahhh, noooooo.\" and when the zombie started to pokemon evolution, i died a little inside. The only good thing this manga done right is one pair of thighs and that's it, and even that, the author just bring them off to you like some special dog rewarding food. Cute character design doesnt make depth. And the form, lol. I see this manga as a bland and childish take on Highschool of the dead and it's not much beyond that, to be honest. The interactions are so forced and unnatural. If i was unable to bing that shit as fast as i did, i probably would have had a stroke in the first chapters. And the plot twists are so unnerving, they are gelastic but the type of comic relief that just strenghten your existential crisis. The MC is dense and a weako, and the dude is muscular and all, well, not that being muscular means you are necessarily brave, but the author just buffed him as to give him a reason to why he is able to survive, and he surprisingly (ironically) becomes smart when his life is at stake, but for the rest of the manga, he is so dense and gullible and stupid. Like he needed the second main goal to have a breakdown in face of him to realize she had feelings for him, woooohhh. And the main girl, Kirara some thing, she is an incels magnet, bland, with only i love you in her mouth and she is always stripped down. I think the author wanted to add her some depth that way, if you know what i mean. (It's not how it works tho) Nahh, but seriously, gal, go wear something, not everyone want to see your bubbly ass. And she bitches all around, always complain. Oh no there is a zombie there, oh no.  Make her eat a sock or something. The second main girl is the pair of thighs one, as a supposedly deliquent girl who beats people asses, she is not credible at all, hard to be baddass-wise credible when the only thing you ever do is getting wet at the mc because he is smiling back at you. Not gonna lie tho, her thighs won my heart over. And she is serious, nicely done. But the character is not credible at all. The MC's sister is just there to take some space and his childfriend is just there because she was mentioned in the beginning of the story. And then there is this generic suspicious dude with a generic smiley face that helps them all because villain no oh oh no the villain has to be a long time friend and a psychobitch, oh no. The romance in it is oversexualized, right, and it doesnt understand how romance realistically work like. One girl falls in love because omfg, he is so brave fighting all of em zombies and the other one fell in love with him because he talked to her in class.

Maybe not as the premise of a series or with having ever put one's own money on the line, but wagers are constantly made in our own minds regarding quality when a new show comes around. A mere glance at the seasonal lineup will inevitably lead to first impressions being made despite how little is known about an anime. But make no mistake, this is to our advantage no matter where in the life cycle of anime fandom you lie. Slowly but surely these thoughts act as effective tools to determine whether an anime will be to our liking. However, for this to happen, gambles must be made. From newer fans learning of disappointment for the first time by not \u00e2\u0080\u0098dropping shit like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hot\u00e2\u0080\u0099, to hardened viewers having learned what garbage lies amongst every season\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dark trenches \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we all made bets one time or another, and we all suffered for our ignorance. As Kurt Cobain said: _Nobody dies a virgin, life fucks us all._\n\nKakegurui was one anime that served this purpose for me. I had hopes for the show to be the standout of its time, only for that hope to be taken and buried six feet under its own morally bankrupt excrement, all while the protagonist stared back at me with a smug, crazy-eyed look on her face. Jesus may not have wept when he felt betrayed, but I could not follow his example. I felt the need to release these pent-up emotions; I wanted catharsis and my review on its first season is where you can find it. I detested Kakegurui for the suffering it put me through and have now seen hundreds of anime to have awakened my third eye. So naturally, one may find themselves asking me _\"hurr durr poohead, if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like, why still watch?_ And to that, my answer is simple: I am Jesus, or at least I like to believe such. One value Jesus promoted during his time on Earth was forgiveness, and like Jesus providing us the ability to atone for past sins, I approach Kakegurui in the same fashion. This is Kakegurui\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chance at redemption and despite already disappointing with the title clearly missing one more \u00e2\u0080\u009cX\u00e2\u0080\u009d, it deserves at least that much from me.\n\n__**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**__\n\nFollowing last season\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anticlimactic finale, Kakegurui x(x)x was put in the awkward position to follow a plot and characters left with practically no conclusions nor a clear sense of direction. Instead of establishing clear intentions of how this season would approach the narrative, no time is wasted introducing viewers back to the main appeal of the series: gambles featuring raunchy females and their sadistic facial expressions. The academy still appears to be lacking in faculty members to ever properly function as an academy, although we are welcomed with new faces. After Yumeko single-handedly decimated the Student Council\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stranglehold over most gambling-related affairs, an election looms over the school for main antagonist Kirari Momobami\u00e2\u0080\u0099s position as president. This causes the emergence of a new threat in the form of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMomobami clan\u00e2\u0080\u009d, all family member related to Kirari with their objective being to banish Kirari from their family. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also revealed that Yumeko is related to the family in some way and also becomes a target of the clan, challenged to a series of gambles throughout this season. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an admirable attempt to drastically shake things up and deliver on more creative, unpredictable moments to keep fans invested. Unfortunately, the intentions still fall short as Kakegurui x(x)x comes across more like a rehash of the first season than otherwise, unable to move away from issues that plagued the previous season.\n\nKakegurui x(x)x as a series thrives on its gambles as they are the easiest way for the series to create any sense of thrill and excitement. This season puts a greater emphasis on them specifically by decreasing the number of gambles taking place and in turn increase the amount of time and focus given to each gamble. Most games take two episodes to complete instead of one and do better in allowing more character development and motivations to take centre stage. In theory this should be a more successful way to structure this season compared to last, however these changes manage to come across in practice as a detriment to the show overall from my perspective. Aside from removing the idea of stakes from their gambles almost altogether, using several episodes to explore the inner workings of games is usually effective when the games themselves have a certain level of complexity to them. Here's the problem: barely any games shown in the series thus far have that level of depth purely in their construction, with games like the \u00e2\u0080\u009cFinger Cutting Guillotine\u00e2\u0080\u009d only being effective as a game of chicken. It also does no help for this show that every gamble is extremely predictable in their outcome, with Yumeko only allowing for games to end in her favour, as proven from S1 and is the way of the Mary Sue. For a piece of entertainment, these drawn-out gambles are unable to adequately capitalize on the initial suspense and excitement viewers wish to feel each episode. \n\nBecause Kakegurui x(x)x is always following the almighty Yumeko and her deus ex machina abilities, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the other characters who are required to do the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heavy lifting. She may be the main character, but their perspectives are the ones always shown when standing opposed to Yumeko and end up changing as a result. In the first season they were barely more than obstacles for Yumeko to swiftly overcome but they still contained something about them that defined them as a character besides their design. Yumemi is an idol singer, Itsuki had a fingernail obsession, even edge-queen Midari had her revolver fetish of all things. In Kakegurui x(x)x, we have a clan full of new characters that we know little to nothing about regarding personality or motives aside from the their clan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s objective. Sorry, but simply having a cool-looking design does not make them any more interesting as characters. They just look cool. Although these new characters do break away from the stereotypes birthed from last season; no longer are all the females psychotic or grotesque, and the introduction of new male characters breaks the idea of males in the show being no more than pathetic beta males. But that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s far from a high positive for the season. So far these new antagonists have been relegated to just fulfilling mandatory roles as Yumeko's opponents. There still lies development present here for secondary characters that is noteworthy, but the way Kakegurui x(x)x treats these characters so sparingly in the narrative does it no benefits. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not fond of seeing a side character to return for two episodes looking like Ken Kaneki from Tokyo Ghoul before being pushed to the side again for however long the narrative demands. \n\nWith how the series handles both its plot and characters with such recklessness, Kakegurui x(x)x is the kind of anime one can find easily detestable. Not to say one cannot find enjoyment anywhere here, but when trying to depict characters created clearly immoral as admirable in a story centred around malevolent aspects of gambling, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m left asking myself serious questions. Who is this being made for? What is this show trying to say? Clearly the show's focus is on addiction \u00e2\u0080\u0093 why else would the anime title be translated to \u00e2\u0080\u009cCompulsive Gambler\u00e2\u0080\u009d? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not shocking that the characters with the most plot armour are the ones with the worst cases of addiction. But what has the series done so far in 24 episodes to really delve into this theme? Yumeko has yet to show any signs of distress or psychological torment while the punishment for losing is constantly raised to astronomical proportions. Is she a sociopath? If so, how is anyone supposed to know when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not even remotely close to a realistic depiction? Kakegurui x(x)x seems to be the kind of show that likes to have its cake and eat it too. It wishes to be a commentary on the dangers of gambling whilst holding the act up proudly on a pedestal, unabashed in sympathising with those clearly contemptible of such deeds. A show that sets up stakes and never follows through with them. Trying to impress with intellect and logic while simultaneously having the Tower of Doors arc end with the loser jumping out the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccorrect door\u00e2\u0080\u009d because she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apparently so smart that she SUBCONSCIOUSLY CALCULATED what door was the one that wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t kill her. The show has so many glaring holes, I could probably order it on the menu at Subway. \n\nKakegurui x(x)x from a visual standpoint is likely to either make or break the experience for viewers, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost solely because of the facial expressions. Once again Studio MAPPA tries to bring out as much insanity from these designs as humanly possible. While it does convey the kind of lunacy viewers are in for when watching characters lose themselves in their games, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still far from aesthetically pleasing and will no doubt have its fair share of detractors. Although if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already this far into the show I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d assume you can tolerate it. The character designs for the main cast are certainly eye-catching especially compared to new characters. Background art is usually typical and unimaginative but fits perfectly fine during games. The visual effects are still a strong part of the series and CGI usage is improved upon from last season. As for the soundtrack used, it never particularly stood out throughout the season but I was pleasantly surprised with the new opening and ending themes used here. Honestly I found myself preferring both themes over those from S1, despite the first from my perspective working as a better introduction to the comical madness this series indulges in. The voice acting also felt like an improvement, not coming across as off-putting when it came to the crazier parts of the script. They all do a great job in their respective roles, with Yumeko Jabami\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance by Saori Hayami capturing a wide array of emotions in her voice to match the character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s absurd behaviour.\n\nAt first, I called Kakegurui pretty awful and feeling like it wasted my time. Now having given the series a second chance my thoughts haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t changed that much. Making a second season that blatantly imitates key events of its predecessor only to fall victim to its shortcomings is not what I had expected or hoped for, but I still found a silver lining to this season. While Kakegurui initially felt more of an insult in what it set out to be, Kakegurui x(x)x has a clearer identity about it that I can respect. Instead of trying to encapsulate far too much in so little time for its own good and as a result failing in every way, this season is more inclined to take a step back from the intensity in order to bring more detail and focus on something grander. Whether this is a significant improvement remains to be seen, but the potential is there, building to something hopefully greater than anything the series has shown us yet. I still dislike the series, but I cannot say that I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t developed more respect for what it sets out to be. And for that, I do not consider Kakegurui x(x)x a complete waste of time."}, {"id": 4297, "score": 45, "body": "\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This statement, or variations of it, is uttered repeatedly throughout the entire run of this show, generally by characters who are thrown into a random chain of events that eventually leads to nowhere, or to an underwhelming conclusion. It is also a statement that many viewers may be inclined to utter when asked precisely what it was, they just watched. Ambiguity is not necessarily a bad thing in anime. But Boogiepop wa Warawanai is so resolutely vague, so eager to confound, that its ambiguity becomes itself ambiguous. Does it intend to let viewers balance competing interpretations? Or does it simply not know what it is trying to say? Though Madhouse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s adaptation is decidedly creepy and occasionally ravishing to look at, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to shake the sense that, beneath its highbrow patina, it is an intellectual mess.\n\nThe premiere episodes reminded me of a conclusion to a case in MTV\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cat Fish. The classic bait-and-switch scheme of what these episodes offered and what was teased in the trailer and OP. The audience is forced to sit through two episodes worth of nothing but conversation after conversation with constant info dumps, most of which come off as teen pseudo-intellectual schlock. We are given barely anything to really connect to the characters who are usually spouting a truckload of vague lines. Being a sponge and soaking up the ideas and thoughts being tossed around when you barely know or care about the people saying them is tedious. And this was very much the case for almost the entirety of the show. The pacing is out-of-control where you have some arcs that burn through the source material faster than Mr. Krabs who saw someone touching his money and some that are slower than Amy Schumer getting a thought out of her head. To make the central mystery more intriguing, it jumps from narrative to narrative with little progress, making the mystery all the more meandering.\n\nBoogiepop wa Warawanai stylistically presents itself in a disjointed and non-linear style for its storytelling, putting the introduction of characters and concepts before plot. This has its pros and cons, in this series case, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a negative when it is extremely character-driven while the characters have zero appeal. More often boring, wallowing in its pseudo-intellectual dialogue, its haphazard assortment of ideas, and dull arc-long leading characters who aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Boogiepop. The titular character is mostly a framer of events, but a minimal participant in them. We are often left with different lead characters depending on the arc, or even multiple leads who are given the spotlight instead. The issue here is most of these arc-long leading characters are bland and not interesting enough to follow as a primary driving force in the story. Majority of the time, the characters feel so drab and uninspired that they sound like the same person, never developing unique enough traits to stand out between one another\u00e2\u0080\u0094the design of the characters don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help either.\n\nWhile the ideas are intriguing on paper, but over the course of its first two arcs, proceeded to completely lose my interest. It raised a bunch of questions, answered them unsatisfactorily and then basically shoved off. It has a habit of drawing you in with one hand while pushing you away with the other simultaneously. Narratively, Boogiepop wa Warawanai is like a body of water covered by whirlpools which are constantly on the move. In practice, they should consistently intersect briefly, all should revolve around the one in the center that is stationary\u00e2\u0080\u0094Boogiepop itself. This would allow the audience to lie back and let the whirlpools take you where they will, where the experience of this disjointed and non-linear style of storytelling becomes far more pleasant, just like in other shows who use a similar way to tell their stories. But what do we consistently get? The violent kind that sucks you under and drowns you. It gives you answers, but at the cost of more questions. It fills in a blank or two, then pulls the camera back to reveal more blanks that you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see in close-up.\n\nWhen it comes to the characters, the focus should have been on showing the inner thoughts through animation, but instead, they just say it like pretentious snobs. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cshow, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell\u00e2\u0080\u009d approach is barely used so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not surprising that you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get wooed by its attempts at intellectual babble. They even have them telling the plot which is yet another sign of a poorly written story. Exposition is everything in Boogiepop wa Warawanai that the experience is less entertaining than watching paint dry on a wall. It has interesting elements and concepts but they are executed in such a disorderly manner that they end up feeling like undercooked ideas. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bloated with them: Aliens, \u00e2\u0080\u0098imaginators\u00e2\u0080\u0099, sterile clones sent to breed with real humans, \u00e2\u0080\u0098flowers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 inside of humans, people with the ability to control minds, shady orginizations, etc. Great fiction can blend various ideas and genres but this show feels like someone pulling ideas out of the ass and stuffing it back in without having the thought of laying a proper foundation for the plot.\n\nFurthermore, I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but be annoyed about the lack of appearances of the titular character. Boogiepop was presented initially with a presence that makes for a mysterious and compelling lead. So, it comes to no surprise (until the last arc) that there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much time to see enough development. Mainly utilized as little more than a pseudo-Deus ex Machina, to appear into the narrative and solve the deadly threat before sh-t hits the fan. Rarely is it the arc-leads who decipher whatever is menacing them, but Boogiepop saving the day in the last moment. This destroys your suspension of disbelief and creates a lack of drama. I realized after the second arc that the moment we arrive at a point of no return, the infamous death reaper will swoop in and resolve everything before things become irreversible. Piecing the so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cpuzzle\u00e2\u0080\u009d together results in no satisfying payoff since almost each is left open to interpretation which makes me feel that we are doing more than working for the answers, but we are doing the work for the one(s) who wrote the story.\n\nThe acclaimed Madhouse is at the helm of Boogiepop wa Warawanai adaptation and I, as a huge fan of the studio, can honestly say that it is not one of their best works. At its best, the visuals are appeasing (in moments of action) but its consistently subpar. Jerky animation and character designs, which are immediately recognizable as Parasyte knockoffs, that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to fit the series\u00e2\u0080\u0099 mystery-laden mood. All the smug faces and robotic stares are irritating. The characters are unmemorable both in design and personality with barely any distinguishable features. Heavy use of line boil, poor framing and an excessive number of pan and zoom shots of stills to prolong scenes that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to be stretched out. Hiring Kensuke Ushio to compose a droning electronic score and reverberating soundscapes is a positive but there is a lot of background music ending abruptly with no fading during transitions between scenes. The seiyuu did their best with a poor script, but really a forgettable performance. The OP, \"shadowgraph\" by MYTH\u00ef\u00bc\u0086ROID is better than the show itself.\n\nOn paper, some of the ideas and concepts, even its method of choice to tell its story are intriguing but it falls on its face in its own puddle of vomit. Boogiepop wa Warawanai juggles too many elements and too many characters that nothing feels well defined. The result is an anime that has the feel of brainy, high-end science fiction, but ultimately neither the underlying structure nor content. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a shame, given that it was originally made in the midst of a modest heyday for the sub-genre. Occasionally raising probing questions about the nature of consciousness and humanity\u00e2\u0080\u0094and offered murky, if non-provisional answers\u00e2\u0080\u0094essentially shrugs, asking viewers to supply their own meaning. What precisely was the creator(s) hoping we might take away from this story beyond a kind of moody befuddlement? \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Worse, by the end of the series, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care. Boogiepop wa Warawanai is essentially a wet dream for pretentious overthinkers."}, {"id": 4299, "score": 25, "body": "I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never seen a sequel to a popular series so butchered since Michael Bay\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stand-alone film Transformers: Age of Extinction in 2014.\n\nThis review is coming from someone who actually enjoyed the Date A Live series quite a bit, especially the \u00e2\u0080\u009csemi-canon\u00e2\u0080\u009d film back in 2015. So when I first heard about the series getting a third season, I was quite elated, to say the least. However, not too long after, I received the unsettling news of the original studio that handled the previous two seasons and the OVAs, Production IMS, undergoing bankruptcy and shutting down permanently, and thus the project was handed off to JC Staff. At the time, the studio wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly a hot topic of controversy or debate, so I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think too much of it. Unfortunately, the issues befalling the studio have started to become more apparent in the season of Fall 2018, especially during the production of the third season of Toaru Majutsu No Index. Needless to say, regardless of whatever the financial and business reasons and so-called justifications as to why the studio is currently conducting itself as of recently, it is not a good enough excuse to brush off what has obviously has become a contagious disease known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cJC Staph Infection\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\n(May or may not have some spoilers*)\n\nSTORY:\nBy now, anyone who watched or plans to watch this show should already know the common drill with how the story goes. A seemingly ordinary young man, Shido Itsuka, encounters and befriends beings called \u00e2\u0080\u009cSpirits\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and in order to stop them from wrecking havoc on Tenguu City, his home, he must make them fall in love with him and then seal their powers with a kiss. In the process, those Spirits become his best friends and allies and also part of the self-inserted harem.\n\nThe premises of the show are quite generic but not necessarily bad at all, especially with how the previous seasons depicted certain scenes and moments as fleeting moments of emotion and beauty. However, this was absolutely not the case here with Season 3. While I try to handle animation quality and story quality separately, this is one of those cases where both seem linked to each other in a bad way. So when the animation quality dropped, so did the course and depiction of the storyline.\n\nThe immediate problem I already have is how certain scenes shift so suddenly and without a proper sort of siegeway between them. Because of the entire lack of buildup between events and arcs, the scenes that are supposed to be the important chunks of the story\u00e2\u0080\u00a6..just feel abstract and soulless. There is no sense of anything emotionally invested at all, not even with the most important arc of the season, the Tobiichi Origami arc. While I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really apply problems in terms of something like world-building, there are obvious plot holes and unwarranted plot devices throughout the story. While such occurrences are not exactly rare with most anime adaptations, Date A Live\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case during this particular season grew far too problematic.\nFor one particular example, during the Origami Arc, Shido, having travelled back to the past to try to undo the changing of history, seemingly dies in the act of protecting a younger Origami; however, the very next scene shows him alive and well in a brand new timeline. Regardless of whether the source material contained an answer or not, there seemed to be no clear-cut explanation as to why a brand new timeline was made, much less as to how Shido isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t dead or even erased from existence due to the possible time paradox. Additionally, the rest of the Spirits somehow regain their memories from the old timeline without much consequence. The fact that the arc relied on an often mishandled plot element known as time travel can stir up unwarranted plot devices like that. Even then, if the production crew implemented genuine emotional investment into many of the events, instead of just forcing it down our throats, such \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeux ex machina\u00e2\u0080\u009d foolery would be honestly easier to overlook in at least at face value.\n\nCHARACTERS:\nOh boy, one of my favorite parts of the review, breaking down the focused characters.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nSince this is a sequel, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I really need to talk too much about the cast that took to the sidelines for this season. The main focus here are the two characters with the two primary arcs: Natsumi and Origami.\nNatsumi, in my honest opinion, is a very unlikeable character, even when she \u00e2\u0080\u009cturned a new leaf\u00e2\u0080\u009d due to Shido\u00e2\u0080\u0099s action. She is extremely childish, and is extremely self-loathing of her original petite form. She perceives everything in a negative light, including herself. Unwilling to accept this feeling of worthlessness, she took on a more physically mature-looking form to perceive herself as the perfect image of what she wanted to be. However, she is really just wanting attention, praising, acknowledgment, and recognition. The problem is that the show fails to depict her in a way where we can have at least some sort of sympathy of her, but instead, due to aforementioned plot holes, she comes off as more of a bipolar, bratty, complaining, and nosy child that only wants to cause trouble for everyone else just because she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel confident about the image of her true self. If someone I become associated with does something along the lines of what Natsumi did during her arc, I would kick him or her out of the house almost instantaneously. Even after she was sealed by Shido, her mischievous, annoying personality is still there\u00e2\u0080\u00a6just not as willing to cause unneeded trouble now, because she simply became a bench player from then on for the next arcs like all the other characters.\n\nOrigami is a primary character from way back in season 1 that I was able to put up with for the most part, up until her segment came up here this season. What I regret now is not immediately realizing that Origami had not gotten over her desire for revenge against the Spirits, even though she has allied with them on a number of occasions. Instead, she started having a growing, self-conceited desire to obtain more power, which caused her to join the villainous group of DEM and later on obtain a Sephira Crystal to become a Spirit herself. Her reasonings for her questionable acts are more immature and unwarranted than Shinji Ikari\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reasonings to not \u00e2\u0080\u009cget in the f***ing robot\u00e2\u0080\u009d. It became all too laughable when she finally realized that she became the very monster that she had always hated since the day she swore revenge for her parents in the old timeline. Her feelings of insecurity finally reaches a breaking point when she herself became the killer of her own parents in yet another (you guessed it) \u00e2\u0080\u009cwell-played\u00e2\u0080\u009d case of time paradox. She then just literally loses all her emotions and became very much mentally dead as an Inverted Spirit. By now, all of us should realize that all of these foolery caused by her during her arc would be completely prevented if her deep-rooted naivety, glossed over by her serious looking expressions, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cause to her to turn to the frigging DEM, of all groups. If she opened up her eyes more and tried to look at the bright side of things or even try to think about forgiveness seriously for once, regardless of what happened back then (which is now irrelevant due to the now changed timeline), she would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve obtained something that would qualify as ACTUAL character development. Everything about her just felt absolutely wasted in her segment, in my personal opinion. I feel like if she did need to become a Spirit, such an event should\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been set up with a totally different situation.\nAs for the other characters, I already stated before: they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just mostly benchwarmers, saved for Kurumi. She actually contributed to the Origami Arc\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.by starting the whole time travel thing. Ugh, great. Well, at least she was sort of a saving grace in terms of enjoyment value if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a Kurumi fan.\n\nART/SOUND:\nFrom the very get-go, even with re-release of the first episode, the animation was immediately something I find hard to bear on a psychological level. In contrast to what the previous installment of the series had, the characters just feel very \u00e2\u0080\u009coff\u00e2\u0080\u009d. What I received was just a discombobulation of still frames and cheaply drawn movements that made the characters look like they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re from some goofy low-budget parody show. This bombardment of slideshows consequently downplayed numerous important scenes, including the fights, and it almost hindered the ability to drive home any sort of emotional investment for even the casual viewer. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost as bad as the crapfest from the second season of TG:Re. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I really need to revisit the situation regarding JC Staff, as like I stated earlier, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no good enough excuse to show us such a poorly made high school project.\n\nAs for the soundtracks, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not exactly bad, but pretty meh compared to the previous seasons. While it was nice to hear some of the old soundtracks, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really enough to make us ignore how awkward the majority of the scenes are visually displayed. The voice acting here is pretty mediocre; it really feels like the seiyuus are just rushing their lines as the show zips through different scenes without much of a proper transition between them. I can only fathom how depressed they are as they realize how poor the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality became while they read off from the scripts.\n\nENJOYMENT:\nNeedless to say, watching the show felt like a chore, which made me really depressed as this was part of a series that I really enjoyed, even though it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a particular personal favorite. I did not want to drop this show because my mindset as a completionist kept giving me this false hope that the show will turn around. However, a part of me is resigned to the virtue I follow: \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor every good or great show, try to watch at least a bad one to balance out your experience.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So I stuck with it until the end, but boy it was a pain train to behold. While I did get some sort of kick out of scenes like Natsumi trying to seduce Shido or Kurumi making her reappearance, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get much else outside of the heavy shelling of my PC from the agonizing display of still frames and laughable overplayed voice acting.\n\nOVERALL:\nDate A Live III was a tragic case of a sequel being handled by the wrong people, though it definitely isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the only one for sure. If you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really enjoy the previous seasons for some reason, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll highly advise you to avoid this trash at all costs. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re like me and actually did enjoy the previous installments, though, prepare yourself for lots of cringe and agony as you watch a near perfect example of how to NOT handle a sequel season. Or you can just nope out and completely avoid the torture chamber that I went through.\n\nNeedless to say, this atrocity will inevitably reflect badly on JC Staff, and while I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d hope they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll learn from their mistakes eventually, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be quite a long while until the day we stop shaking our heads in disappointment when we hear the news \u00e2\u0080\u009cJC Staff will take over for production of this show/season\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n"}, {"id": 4300, "score": 30, "body": "# [~~~**This review will contain Spoilers for the show!**~~~]()\n<br>\nThis had some good moments but sadily those weren't enough to save it :v\n\n[**_(SPOILER AHEAD)_ STORY:**]()\n*Happy Sugar Life* is  show focused on \"Satou Matsuzaka\", a young gal, who doesn't know how to love (due to a horrible past).

The premise is proud with itself for framing Magical Girls in the context of military ops and gun porn, and while it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not determined on punishing its protagonists for cheap emotional punch, most (if not all) emotional scenes lose their importance with the show implementing gratuitous and titillating fanservice. Simply removing such things instantly turns this into a decent show that really understands PTSD, it depicts and tackles this issue well. Spec-Ops Asuka does a good job of showing its heroine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s having to continue living after having fought a bloody, vicious war for humanity's survival, coping with the emotional consequences of their actions. Even though they once saved the world but its survivors are often blaming them for the unintentional side-effects post-war. It's a good hook, but the shows biggest issue with fanservice gets in the way of having these themes resonating, and thus the impact is lost.\n\nAt least it tried to distinguish itself from the crowd by the way it chooses to tackle the Dark Magical Girls sub-genre\u00e2\u0080\u0094by wrapping it into a story about soldiers, war, terrorists, and weapons of mass destruction, etc., which is cool but maintaining your suspension of disbelief is incredibly hard when most of the enemies the heroines are fighting are oversized, cute-looking plushies that have the \u00e2\u0080\u009cFluffal Frightfur\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V) aesthetic to them. And in case any of you were wondering, yes, this show has yuri elements for the sake of having yuri elements. And yes, this show has the \u00e2\u0080\u009call men are assholes\u00e2\u0080\u009d narrative for the sake of\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 well, you get the point. The disappointment comes from the fact that you know that this could have been a decent Magical Girl series. The excessive torture porn, fanservice, and vulgarity just feels too weird, bizarre, cringe-worthy and sometimes unintentionally funny. This is one of those anime series where it recommended to view with the volume turn down and with headphones on because you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want anyone overhearing a big fat orgasm that is thrown into most of those scenes.\n\nFurthermore, I think the creators and LINDENFILMS don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand that you can have a dark and gory depiction of Magical Girls without the excessive number of unnecessary elements. The result is that you get a show that is Cinemanarratively Dissonant. Spec-Ops Asuka is a very ugly undertaking in its depiction of the cruelty that happens in times of war. But we also have to sit through the ahegaokin faces, titillating fanservice with the victims put in scandalous positions. Imagine watching a war movie where the goal and purpose is to show the audience the terror and horrors of war, but during the battle scenes, it's portraying visually that war is the most badass thing ever. Another example is playing a video game where the whole goal and narrative revolves around stealth missions where you have to go through the game undetected with minimal casualties. Yet, there are achievements based on how many headshots you can perform to attain a certain skin\u00e2\u0080\u0094the story being told visually doesn't agree with the story being told by the script. Or, in this case of the video game example; the story being told narratively doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t agree with games mechanics.\n\nBy now you may have gotten tired about the constant callbacks to the show's fanservice. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not against fanservice in general, but just pointing out that the type that exists in Spec-Ops Asuka is the kind that devalues stories. Take Kurumi for example. By the text of the script, she is smart, caring, talented, hard-working, driven, heroic and strong-willed. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essential to the plot and the main Heroine in Asuka, she has her own thoughts and opinions, she comes up with plans, and her character arc meshes while with the themes of the show, like PTSD for example. However, the camera treats Kurumi as a hooker in a strip club because of how she is consistently framed. Despite these good traits and qualities, she is framed to be pervy and annoying, and that dissonance between the cinematography and Kurumi's writing devalues her as a character. The theme of \u00e2\u0080\u009cgirl power\u00e2\u0080\u009d takes a hit when Asuka says she wants to be just as strong as a Magical Girl when she was young, only to have her mother discourage her that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too dangerous\u00e2\u0080\u0094the scene is framed in such a way that girls must remain in the kitchen.\n\nSo, as you can already tell, the shows visuals take\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a dive in the scoring department. Although there are plenty of well-choreographed action sequences, some having solid fluidity to them, LINDENFILMS didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really do the Spec-Ops Asuka justice unless you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re into the fanservice. The character models look like they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re from another decade, and even then, not of the good sort. Most times poorly drawn where facial features get inconsistent with size and proportion. The big eyes and pupils are very distracting. The fashion sense for our character has one goal, which should be obvious by now. Designing almost every female character to have huge knockers is part of the shows absurd hilarity (unintentional) and reinforces the idea that this is basically softcore hentai. The score has a few great tracks which are mainly used for the battle scenes, but apart from the dubstep beats, it just exists. For what it's worth, it has a fantastic OP theme, \"KODO\" by nonoc.\n\nIn conclusion, Spec-Ops Asuka doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t only dwell in seriousness, there are moments, even a dedicated episode for the fun slice-of-life side of things, giving another tone for the characters to show other sides of their personality. Between the fun and campy action stuff, the show is constantly vacillating between gun porn, misery porn, torture porn, justice porn, and just porn\u00e2\u0080\u0094sometimes simultaneously. I found myself laughing in moments when the show feels the need to remind its viewers that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Magical Girl show because the guns and weapons have the name \u00e2\u0080\u009cMagical\u00e2\u0080\u009d in it. A disappointing series, where the flaws outweigh the boobs. A rather great recommendation for hardcore ecchi fans that need more spank bank material."}, {"id": 4304, "score": 10, "body": "**spoilers**\nBrotherhood is easily the most widely beloved anime even amongst non-anime fans. I'm almost convinced I didn't watch the same show these people did. While there is a fair bit I do like about Brotherhood, there is so much I passionately hate that far outweighs the good. I could write essays on so much of Brotherhood, but I'm going to choose the topic where my thoughts are most coherent: Father and the Humunculi.\n\nThe Humunculi are as bland as villains get in fiction; fighting simply because father made them. No ambition beyond that of their Father's. No drive to do something beyond what they are told. No questioning what they were birthed into. Just doing what their told with their sole reasoning being that they were told to, except for Greed.\n\nGreed leaves Father because of his, well, greed. Wanting greater things in life that father couldn't, or wouldn't provide. If that's the case; why is he the only one that has done so? Keeping Sloth, Gluttony, and *maybe* Wrath would be feasible, but keeping Lust, Envy and Pride under-wraps would be impossible. One of Greed's reasons for leaving is lusting after women, so the one *named* Lust would do the same. Envy would grow envious of Father's power and work to take it. Pride would be to prideful to work under anyone, even if they created them. \n\nNot only are the Humunculi flawed in their conception, but Father's foundation for creating the Humunculi is faulty to begin with. His reason being \"to get rid of his emotion\", but in doing this; he would only nuder himself in his quest for god.\n\nWithout Envy or Greed he wouldn't seek god's power, without Wrath or Pride he wouldn't have the malice to use his power. Getting rid of Gluttony and Lust are fine, if pointless for a being without a human body. In getting rid of Sloth however; he would no longer feel the need to create Humunculi, his immense power being more that enough to do any job. After all, why would he *not* do the job himself for any other reason than sloth?\n\nIf Father is able to remove his emotions; why remove *just* the 7 deadly sins? Why not Fear? Why not Sadness? Why not disgust? Why not anything that he would be better without?\n\nFather's quest for god is also on unstable foundation, but in a more practical sense then philosophical:\n\nWe can't possibly care if Father sacrifices Amestris. Stakes need to be personal to be relatable, and relatable to be investing, we can't relate to an entire country. Just as if you say something went from 250C to 275C; saying deaths went from 1,000,000 to 1,200,000 it means nothing to us. We have no concept of a 1,000,000 people dying, so we have even less connection to the 50,000,000 (as stated by the FMA FanWiki; https://fma.fandom.com/wiki/Amestris) that live in Amestris dying, only having a connection a baker's dozen of them.\n\nIn a similar vain; the ambition it'self of gaining the power of god, and ostensibly dominating the world is meaningless to us. What does the power of god entail? Is it even that much greater than the power Father already has? He can already deny the use of alchemy, how much more does he need?\nWhy should we care if he dominates the world? The most we know outside of Amestris is the event in Xerxes and *vaguely* the politics of Xing. The most investment we can get out of this is not wanting a demon to conquer our world and trying to extend that to the show.\n"}, {"id": 4305, "score": 25, "body": "*Due to the nature of the series in question this review contains mention of extreme violence, torture, and sexual assault. Reader discretion is advised.*\n\n*This review contains embedded images that are NSFW*\n\n----\n\nI have seen a fair amount of anime in my 25 years of life. I say in all sincerity, that *Magical Girl Spec. Ops. Asuka* while perhaps not the *worst* strictly speaking, is almost certainly the stupidest.\n\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another universe out there where *Magical Girl Spec. Ops. Asuka* is a more well-considered, and consequently much better, show. *Asuka* is ostensibly a magical girl series, but it has much more in common with dark action seinen like *Gleipnir* or *Murcielago* than it does anything genuinely tied to the mahou shoujo genre. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen it argued that *Madoka Magica* casts a shadow over the series, but that is true to only a very limited extent. Instead, like many other seinen, *Asuka* tries to explore the depths of the human psyche while also being a gory action series. This is a very difficult tightrope walk to pull off at the absolute best of times. Most action seinen that succeed at this do so by being very mindful of what they show and how. Many simply don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even try. *Murcielago* for example throws any attempt at societal commentary to the wind. Simply allowing itself to be the splatterhouse fantasy that anyone reading it would be doing so to experience anyway.\n\n*Asuka* is not smart enough to do either of these things. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not entirely fair to say that it fails as a magical girl story because it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really try to be one. Nonetheless, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth picking apart *why* it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try to. \n\nThe show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core problems on this front can be distilled down to a single exchange in the 8th episode. One character is offered by an agent of the terroristic Babel Brigade to become one of their rogue mahou shoujo. She asks if he wants her \u00e2\u0080\u009cto fight, and kill people\u00e2\u0080\u009d To which he, instead of supplying a real answer, replies \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what magical girls do, right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Without the context of the series around it, it would be easy to take this as an *in-universe* question and response. One built on the discussed entities as they exist within the world of the show. However, from the Doylist (out-of-universe) perspective, with the show that contains it, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really hard to not read this as the author\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actual feelings on magical girl stories in general. \n\nThere is only one obvious, not-evidently-hostile nod to any other magical girl series in the show. That being a parody of the informative segments from *Cardcaptor Sakura*. Even this it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible to take as pugnacious if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re feeling uncharitable enough. And do trust me, by the end of the series, you will *not* be feeling charitable. The prevailing feeling is of a magical girl series by way of Mark Millar. *Asuka* wears the skin of the mahou shoujo genre, but feels like it was written by someone who hates it. \n\nimg660(https://i.imgur.com/temYomA.png)\n\nimg660(https://i.imgur.com/c65a5oK.png)\n\nimg660(https://i.imgur.com/tV0L55b.png)\n\nYet, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most frustrating about Asuka is that when it comes up with what seems on the surface like a good idea, it completely squanders it. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take the already-mentioned 8th episode as an example. The story of antagonist Whiplash Chisato is to be very charitable, deeply problematic. But the core idea of a disabled magical girl who overcomes her physical disability to still fight *could be* a compelling one. Even if that character is (as Chisato is) a villain. Sadly, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to find it explored with any depth, thought, or nuance here. Chisato is ultimately just another curvy body stuck in a revealing outfit. Her disability (the loss of a leg) is just an excuse to give her a shiny robot limb. Which *in of itself*, might still be excusable, even interesting, if given a more compelling and respectful framework. But the show has no interest in that, so the character--like so many others--is completely wasted. \n\nHer character arc (such as it is), instead goes as follows. She is nearly beat to death at the hands of an abusive father after he fails to secure her a job in a whorehouse. Her father is killed by a hulking robot-man who, like many characters in the show, seems to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cinspired\u00e2\u0080\u009d in design by another (here: Al from *Fullmetal Alchemist*). He offers to make her a magical girl. She accepts, gaining the aforementioned shiny robot leg in the process. Some indeterminate amount of time later, she is Good At Fighting now. They walk together on the beach, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s implied she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fallen for the robot-man. We get both of their sad backstories. Hers is that she lost her leg and her mother after a car crash caused by a drunk driver. His is that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a child soldier from Somalia who was forced to join up with a group of armed guerillas after they slaughtered most of his town and forced him to murder his parents and rape his sister. He reveals that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kidnapped the people responsible for her mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death. He makes her kill them. She does so, and vomits as she does. Extra fun: several episodes later it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revealed that all of this was orchestrated by the evil organization she joins. Then, in the finale, Kurumi tortures her again.\n\nimg660(https://i.imgur.com/ZM6dLNJ.png)\n_Normally people who think this works call them \"enhanced interrogation techniques\", so I guess I appreciate her honesty if nothing else._\n\nShe ends up getting a \u00e2\u0080\u009chappy ending\u00e2\u0080\u009d that consists of having a collar filled with chemicals shackled to her neck, and is forcibly recruited into the protagonists\u00e2\u0080\u0099 magical girl organization. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also hired as a maid by the maid cafe` that serves as a front for said organization.\n\nDoes that seem right to you? This is emblematic of *Asuka*\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core issue. There is a whole lot of sadness, death, despair, and downright *bizarreness* crammed into its characters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 backstories and the runtime of the show itself. However, and this is crucial, absolutely *none* of it is ever leveraged to any productive end from a storytelling or thematic perspective. This issue repeats itself in ways big and small over the course of the series\u00e2\u0080\u0099 run. For instance, this character second from the left, introduced briefly in a flashback?\n\nimg660(https://i.imgur.com/wwJzANA.png)\n\nExists solely to be killed a few realtime minutes later, in another flashback. She is dissolved into a skeleton by some kind of goop monster.\n\nimg660(https://i.imgur.com/na5R2DN.png)\n\nThe show is, for a solid 80% of its runtime, sheer misery porn, and not much else.\n\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more troubling is the thematic underpinning this all makes apparent. The gist of *Asuka*\u00e2\u0080\u0099s politics--when it can be coherent enough to have them--seems to be that the only kind of justice is a swift death to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cevil\u00e2\u0080\u009d people of the world. And *Asuka* really seems to have a funny idea of \u00e2\u0080\u009cevil\u00e2\u0080\u009d. \n\nThe series tries to frame Asuka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core struggle--the world needs her to defend it, but she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to do that, being sick of fighting--as a classic heroic narrative, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a key failure of understanding here. When at one point grilled by a villain about why she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing this, Asuka responds, as the camera flashes to mental images of two of her friends, that even if magical girls aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miraculous heroes who can save everyone, that there are still some things that are worth fighting for. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a bad moral on its own, fighting for those close to you is a classic shonen trope. \n\nThe issue is that the world that the series presents is so unrelentingly bleak that it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make that desire actually *feel* particularly heroic. Even after the show tries to sell us on the idea of Asuka having embraced becoming a magical girl again, it still feels like she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being forced to do something that she really doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to. Which is itself not even a problem, inherently, but the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s repeated failure to **sell** any of this just makes the whole thing feel miserable and pointless. The show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempt at a happy ending is roughly this:\n\nimg660(https://i.imgur.com/fsb3nxY.png)\n\nThere are a plethora of other writing problems, but many of these almost seem slight by comparison. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a great sign when the fact that the main antagonists disappear for the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entire middle third, and only reappear in the finale to screw onscreen for about 15 seconds, seems like a minor gripe.\n\nYou might argue--not without reason--that *Asuka* isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a magical girl show and shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be judged by the moral standards of one. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true! *Asuka* is an action series and a war drama. Yet, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really succeed at being either of these things either. \n\nAs an action show *Asuka*\u00e2\u0080\u0099s failings are readily apparent on the production side. Whether LIDEN FILMS simply could not devote the staff to the project or there was some other factor, the animation is often dumpy at best. Even when characters are simply standing around doing nothing, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a kind of slapdash-ness to the shots. When they *are* doing something, *Asuka* often chooses to *not actually animate* what would be its most action-packed moments. So while you do get the occasional nice cut of Asuka say, jumping onto a car, or something like that, the animation is on the whole incredibly lacking. Being mostly reduced to a series of slideshows by honestly sort of pathetic attempts to draw \u00e2\u0080\u009cdramatic\u00e2\u0080\u009d splash screens.\n\nThis *finally* begins to rectify itself as the show nears its conclusion (chiefly in the second to last episode, as the third-to-last and before are often downright ugly). Here, the newly revitalized choreography and the occasional cool shot provide some reprieve from the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mountain of writing problems.\n\nimg660(https://i.imgur.com/SklakNT.png)\n\nSuffice it to say though that by this point it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of too little, too late.\n\nAs a war drama, well, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already gone over the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complete failure to build a compelling narrative arc. Large chunks of the series are intercut with incredibly dull scenes of military officials strategizing or bargaining with other governmental types. None of this adds anything to the series, and were it cut, *Asuka* would be marginally more tolerable. Though it says a lot that this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually one of the *major* problems the show has.\n\nAt the end of the day. It is difficult to imagine much of **anyone** getting anything out of *Asuka*. If you want a dark action series you have dozens of better options. Including its contemporary *Dororo*. If it needs to be seinen specifically, both *Goblin Slayer* and *Magical Girl Site* last year, and *No Guns Life* and *Gleipnir* getting adaptations later *this* year, point to a burgeoning trend of seinen manga getting anime. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a dearth of options.\n\nIf you really insist on a dark action series that *has magical girls*, I find it difficult to believe that you could conceivably pick something worse from the crop that exists. Even long-forgotten early aughts webnovel curio *Sailor Nothing* would be a better choice, simply for weirdness\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sake.\n\nThe sad part is, as someone who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reasonably familiar with the seinen action genre, none of these problems are actually **unique** to *Asuka*, though it is certainly clumsier about them than most. With adaptations of *No Guns Life* and the particularly noxious *Gleipnir* on the horizon, I do wonder just how many shows like this we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in for. My hope is that *Asuka* is the low point of the trend. In this genre, the line that separates fun shlock (*Murcielago*, *The Violence Action*) from the tediously, genuinely awful (*Gleipnir*, and of course, this) is a thin one. *Asuka* isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t completely devoid of merit of course--the soundtrack is great, even if completely out of place, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reasonably fun to riff on the more tolerable parts with friends, but you could almost certainly do better, whatever you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for.\n\nimg660(https://i.imgur.com/PaLFggj.png)\n_Fuck off._\n\n----\n\nplanet Jane can be followed here on Anilist, and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/planet_Jane).\n\n_[If you enjoy my writing, you may want to follow my writer tag on general nerd interest website GGA, where I pen an anime column every Tuesday.](https://www.geekgirlauthority.com/author/jane-y-auman/)_"}, {"id": 4312, "score": 9, "body": "\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt at once is the antithesis of creativity and a testament to everything that can go wrong with ambition in art; it is the enemy of creativity itself!

Unfortunately, we live in a society, where something like this can get popular as a punching bag, garner a prequel OVA, a sequel series, and several stage plays despite flopping both critically and commercially. Understandably, by the time this sequel was announced, almost no one cared anymore. A sequel to Hand Shakers is frankly that unfathomable. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like making a sequel to Ride to Hell Retribution or Battlefield Earth. No one asked for this, and yet it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s here. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not only here, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rocking enough product placement to impress Michael Bay. Why? Any rational human being would have shitcanned this heap ages ago, or at the very least worked on other projects before even considering attempting this again. However, director Shingo Suzuki is not a rational human being, and neither am I as I watch Studio GoHands drag its name through the mud a second time. \n\nWasting time by dissecting the nightmarishly awful and consistently contradictory world-building is fruitless. Tackling all the fresh new ways W\u00e2\u0080\u0099z adds nonsensical terminology, conjures up nonsensical contrivances, contradicts its own predecessor, and breaks its own franchise\u00e2\u0080\u0099s established rules even before it re-establishes them itself, is pointless. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a good 5K words no one wants to type or read about when I can just say \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe first condition Hand Shakers introduces for losing is for your team to stop holding hands, and they broke it immediately\u00e2\u0080\u009d. W\u00e2\u0080\u0099z\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grotesque predecessor made all this into a fucking hobby, so of course this show follows suit. How else can we have a team consisting of a melee and a ranged fighter without breaking the one rule of this franchise for the umpteenth time? How else can they allow literally every character to not hold hands and suffer no repercussions, even when it makes no difference to their fighting style? Needless to say, they shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have even bothered telling us what the rules are when not only does the show constantly break them, but the characters themselves don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even know them.\n\nThe dialogue\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as heinous as ever, with \u00e2\u0080\u009cmesh\u00e2\u0080\u009d being spammed to hell and back, and characters actively describing both their own and each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personalities to each other. The monologuing is exactly as insufferable as it is rampant as well. The mere concept of this show, this entire franchise, even if it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get contradicted constantly by these sorry excuses for screenplays, is inherently broken. This is all shit we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard before. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s literally just Hand Shakers, but with a music video theme and vibe, and a cast of over-the-top gimmick caricatures meandering for minutes on end while hanging out with our bland returning cast. The only things new are the new pieces of convoluted, nonsensical lore, terminology, and gaudy religious references about God and language and the Tower of Babel and whatever. They do try to bring in some personal drama for the old cast, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as far as anything goes in terms of actually trying, and the characters are so badly written that I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t begin to care. No amount of poorly and predictably placed backstories will ever change that, especially when said backstories dismantle the already mind-numbing pacing and episode structure. The characters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 motivations and arcs are beyond nonsensical as well. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pointless to even discuss the writing any further since even the original Hand Shakers wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t burned in effigy over that shit, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s despite this anime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s narrative somehow being even worse.\n\nTwo years ago, I claimed that if it wasn't for the obnoxiously bad visuals that were supposed to be seen as \"visionary\" or \"innovative\", almost nobody would be talking about this franchise. To think W\u00e2\u0080\u0099z would prove me right. Hand Shakers was the apex of a saga of GoHands pushing the envelope in how much garish, blinding, inconceivable shit it can add to its signature style before the audience throws up and retaliates. Now that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve jumped back, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing really to discuss, nothing new to get angry about or sell this series as a disasterpiece with. Sure, we can bitch about the abysmal vehicle, weapon, and pedestrian CGI, which is as prevalent as it is disgusting. We can complain about the awful camera and background movements, the frame rate dips, and terrible choreography all we want. Same goes for all of the unfinished choreography and nonexistent animation, terrible color and character designs, blinding filters, needless and ill-conceived camera tricks. None of it is new. Not even the blatant stock assets and reused footage are worth noting beyond the fact that a sequel should fix all of this kind of shit, and that none of this should have made it past the initial pitch back in the franchise\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inception. Even going into detail with how the show actually looks good during the few times the show lets go of most of this tacked-on glitter and make-up in episode 1 is old news at this point. The best I can do is praise some of the nifty shots and editing tricks the first episode pulls early on, which are reminiscent of cheesy music videos which this show attempts to emulate. Other than that, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all dead air and retreaded ground. Even the needlessly abysmal and frequent attempts and 2D and 3D CGI compositing isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a startling talking point anymore. \n\nYou wanna know the real kicker here? The first 30 seconds of this show took my breath away. We hear someone whistling as he walks before an impressive fish-eyed lens shot of skyscrapers, before switching to Doctor Strange style kaleidoscopic imagery of the city. Barring the shitty CGI and garish lighting filter sandwiched between these impressive sequences, it actually painted the picture of a promising anime with a music video aesthetic. Imagine my disappointment when it went back to doing the same shit that made Hand Shakers so reviled. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as if Shingo and his team at GoHands knew what they were doing and chose to trick people expecting something new. If that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sound wack to you, then you might actually enjoy this dumpster fire.\n\nThe OST is almost as uninspired and badly implemented as it was before, except now they added FUNKY FRESH BEATS AND SHIT! It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also as badly edited as the music in a bad student film. But hey, at least they came up with a track or two that works in a vacuum, and they even worked up the courage to put an orchestral battle theme in the midst of all the elevator jingles. Again, barely even half of these tracks are good and some don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even fit, but when I have to stretch this thin for compliments, anything goes. The only thing of note left is how surprisingly reserved this show is with its OST, which is for the better. Then again, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no use even trying to compliment that cuz even when this show corrects a mistake, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a mistake that should have never been thought of in the first place. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a competent sequel just cuz they added some beats to a dry OST to make up for their shitty fucking OP and ED, or because they dialed back on the eye-searing AIDStacular visuals they had no business going this overboard with for like 5 minutes before hopping right back into doing everything as wrong as possible again. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just backpedaling, lazy, lifeless, stupid backpedaling that means nothing to no one. In some ways, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even worse than Hand Shakers because as repugnant as that piece of shit is, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so avant-garde in its awfulness that even when separating it from how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the culmination of a studio taking its style too far, it would at least make for a pi\u00c3\u00b1ata worth bashing, even if that one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still the more insufferable of the two.\n\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s honestly no point in going any further. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been two years, and nothing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been learned or gained. Not even I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned to stay away, and I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even plan to watch this until a friend I moderate for put this on his stream. The worst part is: I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even really be able to get closure on a franchise that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s haunted me for years anymore, as just when we think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dead, it comes back. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even funny anymore. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s honestly depressing. This is the kind of thing that would make even the most rose-tinted anime fan jaded towards this industry. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a cruel joke, with schmucks like me serving as the punchline. W\u00e2\u0080\u0099z is the purest example of a director and studio taking the piss. At what point do we draw the line? When do we decide to stop watching, and begin avoiding and boycotting this thing? When will they decide to move onto a brand-new IP and let the dead horse lie? When is enough going to be enough?

I have never before seen a show that was one half live-action and one half 3D CGI. The problem here however is that there are two kinds of unique ideas: The kind that nobody has tried before because they didn't think of it and the kind that nobody has tried because everybody already knew how godawful of an idea it was. And DHS more than certainly belongs in the **latter** category. \n\nBut let's take it from the top. DHS, in its essence, is a show about four guys and their teacher getting approached by a floating, talking rock and convinced to agree to be teleported into a CGI-version of the classroom they were in previously to solve riddles posed to them by what is *referred* to as sphinxes - but only consists of the head and front legs of said mythical creatures - in order to prevent those sphinxes from getting from the 2D to the 3D world and wiping out humanity. Every time they lose, the sphinxes absorb the soul of one of them, making them lose whatever they held dearest in the *actual* world as well as get one step closer to entering the third dimension. And if anything I just said makes sense to you, then I'm afraid I have bad news for you and your mental state.\n\nHere is how the overwhelming majority of the episodes play out: Most of the first half is a (mostly godawful) live-action skit of the cast doing whatever it is people in their thirties probably think schoolkids these days do when they're in school. During this time they then learn *something* (either randomly throughout the scenes or because the teacher mentioned earlier, well, teaches it to them), after which the talking rock appears and contrives another reason to teleport everybody present. The second half then consists of the currently active sphinx (of  which there are four in total throughout the entire show) giving them their first riddle, which they invariably lose, making one of them get their soul eaten. The sphinx then poses forth a second riddle, which they invariably **win** (often by applying whatever it was they learned in half one), after which we return to the live-action world and get to learn what it was the one person who got soul-vacuumed lost. Repeat that process ad nauseam and you've got yourself a cour!\n\nRidiculous repetition is not the only massive issue Dimension High School suffers from however, no sir! It also serves as a beyond perfect showcase of how very fking different anime and live-action are when it comes to what can and cannot work in a script. That is not to say that DHS's dialogue would've been good in a fully animated setting, god no, but the fact that all of the lines present are being spoken by what you can immediately perceive as a real person makes an already excruciatingly painful script even more unbearable and difficult to listen to. And it would appear that I am not the only person who found the dialogue to be a nightmare, because the actors deliver most of their lines almost as if they were forced to read them or have their puppies be shot. I can not remember a stretch of time longer than maybe 3 minutes going by without me noticing a line of dialogue that was brought across just as poorly as it was written. The most painfully obvious examples of this were the times when ~!Ryuusei had lost what was most precious to him, his dignity, immediately turning him from a stereotypical 'smart no-nonsense' character into a goofy wanker, constantly spouting **\u00e2\u0080\u009d**funny**\u00e2\u0080\u009d** lines 24/7!~\n*Wow, I can't believe I just had to spoiler something in a review of **Dimension High School**.*\n\nAnyway, what else is there to *say* about this anime? It's a terrible idea executed incredibly poorly. There is basically nothing redeeming about this entire thing. The most 'fun' I had throughout these 12 episodes was taking a few screencaps of lines that were unintentionally funny and that was it. There's nothing else to say here. If it hadn't been for Mahou Shoujo Tokushusen Asuka, this right here would've been the worst anime of a dreadful season.\n\nAnd to anybody planning to ask why I not only forced myself to watch this anime in its entirety, but also *review* it, I shall leave you with no doubt my favourite line from the entire anime that perfectly encapsulates why.

It's really over the top and normally I'd find myself complaining about it. But it was kind of interesting in this story. I love the idea of some type of monster coming across the girl and mutating her slowly. With her having to hide it and it slowly becoming worse. Maybe eventually she learns to stay in her human form. \n\nBut in this, She just swallows a Wasp, Gains a Stinger and makes a Harem of loyal girls. The last part doesn't sound bad ( \u00cd\u00a1\u00c2\u00b0 \u00cd\u009c\u00ca\u0096 \u00cd\u00a1\u00c2\u00b0) But it's really fast-paced and the horror and the transformation of the MC isn't great and is kind of boring. Again, I'm kind of sad she only got a Stinger but nothing else. I still want to see her slowly transform into a Monster that is Half Wasp/Human. Her slowly getting followers but it is lacking in any horror or excitement. It really is just a poke and it's done. I would've loved to see some of the victims trying to escape or them struggling as they start becoming loyal to the MC.\n\nIn the end, It quickly turns to shit. The Government for some reason already knows of the Wasp and that really is one of the worst parts. It ruins the horror and the story quickly becomes just a generic story with \"Evil Government Men and they want control of X for more POWER!\" I've seen stories like that and it's always annoying. Then for some reason, I can't understand. It starts getting into things akin to Radial Feminism. It's really quite jarring since the story wasn't good but it was solid, It had a foundation. But this is so weird. It starts saying stuff like how men are actually the inferior and that things like Evolution are wrong because for some reason women working the fields of farms while the men went out to do the hard labor was somehow wrong? I mean, For the time it actually makes sense why women were the ones to stay home. Men were the ones able to handle more physical things than women on average. This is just such a weird thing to add to a story.\n\nI wish we instead got a more horror story about some bullied High-School girl slowly turning into something like Half-Human and Half-Wasp (PLEASE NOT IN THE STYLE OF THE FLY, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU JEFF GOLDBLUM?!?) As she starts to become stronger and starts gaining more of an image of a Queen. I imagine the kind of gets more of a mature body with things like wings and Retractable Attenae and a normal looking jaw at first but is actually mandibles. Then things like a natural instinct to start to gain followers. Also, Have it more in a desolate area like an Island and DON'T have the government besides Police get involved. Maybe near the Climax, The Military comes in because of weird shit going on. I like to picture it as the Military in the Movie \"The Mist\" \n\nReally I am just disappointed.

The description did sound original, within the framework of Mahou Shoujo of course._\nThe Mahou Shoujo genre is increasingly repetitive, that's why even magical girls fighting against terrorists sounded more interesting than it was. However, the more the episodes progressed, the more I questioned myself whether this was really a Mahou Shoujo or a hentai of terrorists.

Although I will comment later on the characters, it is impressive how blands they all are during the development of those twelve episodes. The action scenes are decent, but often exaggerated to show the Magical Five more badass than they really are (I'm talking about you, Rapture). And obviously, we should not forget about the fact that most of them have tits bigger than Nozomi's head (We couldn't do it even if we wanted to, the tits are in the center of the screen most of the time).\n\n__3. Characters: 3.5__\n_Oh, boy. This poor, small quintet is so interesting ... in the bad way, obviously._\nFrom now on, I will need to spoil irremediably.\n~!Let's start with Asuka, which had PSTD at the beginning of the show. Oh, this could develop well, right? Oh, wrong. Because Asuka's PSTD disappears, ironically, with more violence. Surprisingly, she is the most sane of the gang. Then we have Kurumi who is, for me, the worst of the Magical Five. His personality and story seem as if they were taken out of a bad fanfic of Wattpad of 2012, when it was fashionable to be edgy. That, and her attempt to be yandere in 2019, is really embarrassing. On the other hand are Mia and Tamara, who are not so different from each other so I'll put them together to save me time. Both of them belong to the army, more or less, and they like to shoot things and so on. The only thing that distinguishes them is that Tamara has a fetish with \"tender and adorable\" things, and Mia's unique personality is based on her revolvers. And finally, and obviously less important although the show tries to make you think otherwise, Lau Pei-pei. Pei only appears in the last episode, and we only discovered that while the other girls have returned to fight with the Disas and that kind of stuff, she became an Asian Paris Hilton who is also a hit man. Oh, and obviously she's also a bit of a nymphomaniac, like most women in the whole series. The funny thing is that although Pei-pei has not done anything in all these episodes, we still have her in the last scene of the season (or series, rather) with the others, in an attempt to message us something like: \"These are the heroines you've seen during all these episodes! Yes, even Pei-pei.\"!~\n\n__4.

Then one day you realize that things will never change.\n\nEven with its best season, Pokemon XY, I was still reminded constantly of just how little substance there was in the plot. It could be summed down to, \"Bad things happen. Protagonist doesn't give up. The power of hope and love wins.\" Basically, every typical shounen plot, ever. The repetitive formula became even worse when mixed with the slow-paced slice-of-life genre in Sun & Moon, a genre which doesn't work for many people, myself included. Do note that I'm not saying shounen anime in itself is bad; it just so happens to not be the kind of anime I could enjoy or tolerate any longer. \n\nPokemon Sun & Moon sees our never-aging protagonist, Ash Ketchum, landing in yet another new region, Alola. He meets new friends and Pokemon, but this time, he's no longer pursuing his childhood dream of \"being the best that no one ever was,\" and instead chooses to settle for a more peaceful school life full of hijinks and quirky comedic antics. Basically the perfect plot for 7 year olds. So don't be mistaken - Pokemon is essentially a show for kids, now more than ever. In spite of its TWO episodes with more mature themes (which are still family-friendly parables designed to teach children about the meaning of death anyway), it's not really the \"darker and grittier\" kind of show some have exaggerated. It's Pokemon, a shounen show where the power of friendship triumphs over logic. Whereas the previous seasons had the excuse of being entertaining with its more fast-paced battle scenes, those moments are now few and far between, replaced by cutesy moments of Ash and his friends fooling around with whatever Pokemon they wish to market for the day. Basically your average filler episode of Pokemon filled up to 90% of the season.\n\nThe characters are written decently enough, but I didn't watch Pokemon for some deeply complex characters; I watched it for the epic fight scenes that were once prevalent in XY. Decent and functional character writing just isn't good enough to cut it for my entertainment. Most of the characters are written in such a way as to teach about familial bonds and not giving up in the face of failure anyway; basically your average shounen moral lessons for 7 year olds. They are characters designed to educate children about the most generic and basic form of humanity, the kind that have been seen many times over in thousands of other shounen anime.

Things I've watched I would say that they were very easy to follow. I'm a very emotional guy but I love to look for romance when finding new things to watch. But with watching much romance, for me, I get a very bad emotional baggage (which I enjoy because I feel like I grow as a person when struggling with it) where I think about the emotional coaster the anime has gotten me into. The anime Nerawareta Gakuen was very hard to follow for me. Throughout watching the anime, I couldn't relate or get emotionally attached to any of the characters. Nothing in the plot made sense. I understand that explaining the entire plot is boring and I understand that as long as you understand what is freaking going on, there's no need for explaining. My favorite show which does this correctly is House Of Cards and Black Mirror. Both shows not needed to explain the plot because it is easily understood. Leaving the viewers to question plot holes is very much part of the enjoyable experience. An anime example I would like to throw out there is Your Name. Very little explaining of the plot, but very easy to catch on to and very enjoyable plotholes. The anime Nerawareta Gakuen might not be an anime for me altogether. Maybe I just don't like plotholes and open-ended questions that I need to answer on my own when watching anime. But I know that's not the case because there is a short film that I watched that counters this argument, Shelter. Full of questions, a very enjoyable part of the experience.

It is practically inexcusable to have people wait out just over seven years for another season, and then come out with such a disappointing product. Having watched and enjoyed the previous two seasons, I was really looking forward to an announcement for a third one.

Watching the Railgun series is also a helpful option to familiarize yourselves with the majority of the characters.\n\nIt was after the first three episodes that the lack of craftsmanship became very obvious to me, despite me not wanting to initially admit it at the time. One of the biggest issues in the show, while common with most LN adaptations, grew prominent as one watches\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.PACING. Even though I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t read light novel or manga sources myself, it was made clear very early on than the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s content has been condensed and trimmed to accommodate for the listed twenty-six episodes. From what I was told, the season was trying to shove nine volumes worth of content, which contrasts the shared thirteen volumes by the previous two seasons.\n\nBecause of the forced condensation of the story, the six individual arcs within the plot, excluding the final climactic WWIII arc don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t last much more than three episodes. This consequently results in the sudden introduction or reintroduction of characters, and we are expected to care about them without enough, if any, background context to them. The lack of proper introduction of the cast members can leaves viewers quite lost and confused, as they try to figure out the characters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 individual motives within the story.

Because of the significant lack of character background, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also hard to feel for them when some of them die in action.\n\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use a somewhat brief example with the Battle Royale Arc. Being the only arc to actually not feature the main protagonist Kamijou Touma, it was supposed to focus on Accelerator and reintroduce Hamazura Shiage in a major protagonist role, as well as reintroduce the group ITEM, whom we may know previously from watching the Railgun series. This was the most problematic arc for me, personally; for a segment that only lasted three episodes, it was clear that the studio probably wanted to have it over and done with quickly to set up room for the finale. Throughout the adapting of the Battle Royale, new characters and groups are just introduced from left to right without any sort of explanation of what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re here for and why, making their actions feel so forced and idiotic. Many of the fights that take place during this arc and future ones often conclude off-screen for no apparent reason. \n\nNot to mention, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s FAR too much pointless standing around and talking during those bouts; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not actually taking stuff in earnest or sincerity with their actions at all, considering how vaguely their intentions are portrayed. As if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not enough, a good number of these introduced or reintroduced characters are seemingly killed off suddenly without anything building up for them, sometimes biting the dust off-screen; in fact, some of them are simply introduced and then killed within the same damn episode; as a result, we feel absolutely nothing for them. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s any possible as a viewer get emotional over such poorly introduced cast members.\n\nAdditionally, the plot omits helpful exposition or even inner dialogue that would explain what certain characters were thinking or how some were able to perform something particularly hard to explain. All we end up getting are mostly just poorly conducted fights and pointless, bland dialogue from the characters. \n\nThe show also fails to show any of the characters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 inner thoughts, which would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve proven helpful in terms of giving more sense and logic to their actions. Whatever exposition that DOES come out, or what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supposed to be exposition, quite often feel like very half-hearted attempts to sound witty due to the unfortunate lack of prior context. Lastly, the constant, nauseous shifting between POVs, without the proper siegeways or breaks, just makes it even harder to follow and keep track of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on, especially with the kind of pacing this show has resorted to.\n\nThe only particular arc that I considered okay was the Acqua of the Back Arc. For this particular segment, despite being just three episodes as well, the story didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really seem to omit as much important events and details as the others. Kanazaki, one of my more favorite support characters of the show, returns to take a more upfront role as a combat participant against the likes of Acqua, who himself was a particular character of interest. Nonetheless, this arc felt rather pointless for the story, or at very least, not made clear.\n\nART/SOUND:\nThe quality of the animation is notably downgraded from the previous seasons. The 2D animation and designs from this season, while not exactly awful, per say, have considerably more inconsistencies compared to the second season and the Railgun series. The movements don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel as fluid or liberated, the characters can occasionally look \u00e2\u0080\u009coff\u00e2\u0080\u009d in terms of facial expressions and body gestures, the emotional acts feel far more overdramatic than emotionally powerful, and the special effects are just horrific. The CGI was not exactly very pleasing; while it was not anywhere near \u00e2\u0080\u009cHand Shakers level\u00e2\u0080\u009d of awfulness, the notably increased usage of it resulted in poorly choreography of the 1-on-1 fights and the military conflict.\n\nThe soundtracks are actually very nice and at least try to fit with the tense or lighthearted mood, depending on the current point of the story. Maon Kurosaki, whom also did the two ending themes for the second season previously, sings the two opening themes for this one. Both songs are j-pop rock soundtracks, with \u00e2\u0080\u009cGravitation\u00e2\u0080\u009d setting a moderate tempo to fit the inner urban activity and stuff going on behind the scenes, while \u00e2\u0080\u009cRoar\u00e2\u0080\u009d is more complementary to represent the frantic tension of international war and all-out conflict. The sound effects this season just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the same kind of natural feel; for example, while I understand changing the noise of Touma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Imagine Breaker was to make it sound more ominous and mysterious, due to the ambiguous and undisclosed nature of his power, it can feel quite out of place amidst the heavy conflict of him fighting it out with his adversaries. The previous sound, felt more fitting as it gives the clear indication of something being cancelled out and/or broken through, which is exactly the effect of Touma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s power. The voice acting was fine, in all honesty, but the vagueness of the story and plot can have you wondering why, for example, two high-leveled espers in Accelerator and Kakine are just excessively screaming for no particularly good reason or explanation; as a result, it just feels like overcooked displays of emotion. At least the show sort of lets us know when to cover our poor eardrums when a characters wails with absurdity.\n\nCHARACTERS:\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not much else I can really say about the new supporting characters, as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve mentioned the major issue with them in the previous section of this review. The more prominent recognizable main and support cast from the previous seasons are, in all honesty, unchanged for the most part.\n \nTouma is still the usual \u00e2\u0080\u009cact first, talk later\u00e2\u0080\u009d selfless character we should all remember, regardless of whether we hate him or not. With the exception of the Battle Royale Arc, Touma has always taken at least a major role in all the arcs he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s involved in, especially the final arc, the WWIII Arc, where he fought the superiority complex jackass known as Fiamma, who was trying to accomplish the typical, regurgitated objective of world domination.\n\nIndex, as always, with the exception of the final arc, always took to the benches on the sideline and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really have a very major role. While I can understand her origins and her case of amnesia, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never really liked Index as a character due to her rather annoying personality. Despite her high intelligence, she is overly na\u00c3\u00afve and easily irritated, which often leads to the gag where she bites poor Touma on the head, often for no good justifications. She does have a good side to her, though, as she is shown to kind, nice, and polite with other people. Despite the bright side of her, her role as the primary heroine just never felt right, as she barely get involved personally barring when she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taken hostage. In the final arc of this season, she is only relevant as a puppet of destruction until she was eventually freed. Her mostly backseat role, despite being the main heroine, felt like a hindrance as she almost always ends up in the damsel-in-distress situation when she does get involved, and Touma is usually the one that has always had to be her savior.\n\nMisaka Mikoto, another favorite character of mine and one that I personally felt that should\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken both roles as main heroine in both Index and Railgun (but is unfortunately a support cast member in the former), doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up as much as she used to in the previous seasons, though she does appear as a minor participant in the WWIII Arc to try to help her love interest in Touma. Her character from the previous installments is mostly unchanged for the most part. The majority of times Misaka is seen is almost always involving Touma, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the usual lighthearted gag of her getting flustered and/or angry due to her feelings for him, or it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on a serious note where Misaka is trying to tell Touma to not push himself, with the latter saying otherwise. In the end, Touma and Misaka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship stayed pretty much the same, so Misaka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall relevance to the season was not exactly as full-fledged as it could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been.\n\nA particular support character I do want to focus on is Hamazura Shiage. Previously an antagonist in the Skill-Out Arc in the previous season, he is involved as one of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood guys\u00e2\u0080\u009d, especially during the dreadfully adapted Battle Royale Arc. Because of the shift to him playing as a protagonist, character development for Shiage was absolutely necessary to give more meaning to his actions. However, to the aforementioned issues with the said arc, Shiage\u00e2\u0080\u0099s imagery in the adaptation seemed more like an idiot shifting between wishy-washiness and recklessness. He is neither as idealistic and compassionate as Touma, nor as bloodlusted and insane as Accelerator; in this way, he can be considered as a medium between the two. He has an obvious inferiority complex due to being branded as a powerless individual and not having esper skills himself, hence his previous involvement in the Skill-Out Arc. While he does get notable character development within this part of the series, it just seems so rushed and without enough context behind it to be considered properly managed. The show basically displayed his change as if it was propelled solely via the virtue of his growing feelings with a barely memorable support character (at least in the Index story), Takitsubo Rikou\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how a well-written character is supposed to experience progression.\n\nAll the other returning support cast members barely get much highlights unless they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re heavily involved within a particular arc. While the previous seasons, due to their better sense of pacing, gave them more reason to pay attention to and be attached to them, this sequel didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really do them much justice. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just there cause the story sorta \u00e2\u0080\u009cobligated\u00e2\u0080\u009d them to be present. Itsuwa, one of those particular support characters, started out her reintroduction with developing her feelings for Touma, and while she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s considerably much nicer to the latter and arguably a better female partner for him, she never truly got much shine outside the Constantine and Acqua Arcs. \n\nOn one \"dual-colored\" note, while Accelerator himself was a rather enjoyable character due to his nature and did get a significantly more prominent spotlight and better characterization during this season, his role is still mostly overshadowed by the chaos of the events going on around him. \n\nIn short, overall, a bunch of wasted products in the character department.\n\nENJOYMENT:\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be quick to the point. I started out really enjoying it for the first few episodes. The first episode really had me optimistic, especially with one of my favorite gags where Misaka gets upset at Touma, fires her electrical powers, and Touma blocks it with his Imagine Breaker. It was always SO nice to see the two\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interactions and dynamics, as they were more common and meaningful in the previous seasons. Unfortunately, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get much of that all with the third season. Sure, Itsuwa played as a nice substitute, and the return Kanazaki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tsundere behavior due to her OWN feelings for Touma (from way back in season 1) was something to give credit to in terms of enjoyment value, especially for me, personally\u00e2\u0080\u00a6but in the end, those were still simply flauntings of rather unnecessary fanservice made just for the fanboys.\n\nAs for the serious parts of the story itself, it was an absolute pain to watch. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve mentioned those issues already; rushed events, poorly animated fights, jarring CGI, characters being introduced left to right that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to catch up to or consider them as something important. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a mess that I tried my best to stick with and be optimistic about. However, with the handling of the British Royal Family Arc, where the main purpose of the segment and Touma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intended involvement was severely downplayed, it became so clear that the show is literally going nowhere in the right direction. It was literally like watching your birthday or homecoming party getting crashed by a bunch of drunk idiots. Considering that J.C. Staff was also handling the third season of Date A Live at the time, and how horribly it turned out, it became all the more obvious that, regardless of what financial reasons or justifications, the studio just tainted its own brand by not being able to hire a proper team of staff members during the production of this show. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m honestly disheartened because in the past, J.C. Staff produced plenty of other good shows in addition to the previous two seasons of Index as well as the two Railgun seasons. While I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say it was like a hated chore, it still felt laborious to watch.\n\nOVERALL:\nConsidering how we waited for years for the third season, and to receive a spoiled meal like this, Toaru Majutsu no Index III is the one of the more disappointing sequels in the recent years of anime. This season clearly needed more than just 26 episodes, and in the end, it was simply a rushed school project like Date A Live III and both TG:Re seasons were. To be honest, I wished this season was given more time to work with so that events, characters, and themes are played out and executed a lot more properly than what was showcased here. At this point, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m highly considered to hit the light novel books for the first time and start from the very beginning, provided I find time for that. \n\nUnfortunately, for this season, it was simply something unable to follow up on the series\u00e2\u0080\u0099 previous accomplishments. I now pray to God, Christ, Arceus, whomever is up there\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.that the new Accelerator anime and s3 of Railgun don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fall victim to the dreaded plague of JC Staph Infection as well.\n"}, {"id": 4346, "score": 44, "body": "I don't even know why I watched this, you can't keep up with ANYTHING. Random characters keep appearing out of nowhere and you have no idea who are they, angels? gods? people fighting among each other? I really liked the previous seasons I don't know if it was because I was dumb enough to like anything or because it was better, and after watching this I don't even feel like re-watching the old ones anymore. What a wreck.\n\nArt: 7/10\nGotta admit it's okay, J.C never fails to impress. The characters looked memorable and the abilities graphics looked nice, sadly it's nowhere near as good as Railgun combat animations but it's better than previous Index seasons I guess. Despite everything, this is one of J.C's strengths in my opinion.\n\nStory: 3/10\nNothing makes sense. I think you have to watch the visual novel to understand anything but that is no excuse for this poor writing. An anime series needs to stand up on its own otherwise just make it a TV Short or a teaser to that novel. No matter if the story is good or not I think it's poorly executed.\n\nSounds: 7/10\nFine I guess, isn't exactly anything to write home about, and I didn't notice any amazing OST either, might have been cause I generally didn't like the series so don't quote me on that. The ending song was okay though.\n\nCharacters: 3/10\nThere was absolutely no character development at all. If you watch the characters on their first appearance and at the end of the anime they all act and think the same. Except the \"bad guy\" as usual cause godmode Kamijo Toma punched sense into him.\nI wish Misaka showed more action she literally did absolutely nothing, she is supposed to be #3 esper for god's sake. The whole anime doesn't need to revolve around her like Railgun series but come on, the little Misaka had more camera time than the original one.\n\nEnjoyment: 2/10\nWatching this anime is painful. It's so painful that every episode I thought about dropping it.\nI gave this one point cause it made me smile every now and then at the absurdity of everything that was happening, I'm glad I had friends to talk to so we could mock this writing and it brought us something to talk about.\nThe second point was for nostalgia, it brought back some good days around the time I started watching anime, good old days.\n\nOverall this is not worth watching, save your time if you're thinking about picking it up."}, {"id": 4393, "score": 40, "body": "I've always been a big fan of the Crash Bandicoot franchise, that's where the Crash in my name comes from, and so when I found out that there was a short manga based on the franchise I had to read it immediately. I didn't went into it with big expectations, things like this are generally decent at best, but even then this manga managed to disapoint. \nCrash Bandicoot Dansu! loosely follows the plot of the second game, in which Cortex convinces Crash to grab the Power Stones for him and that's basically the whole plot. Each chapter Crash, Aku Aku and Cortex find themselves in an adventure to find the Power Stones, although more often than not the actual Power Stones aren't present. It's a simple episodic plot that can be excused having in mind the source, plus it's full of big and little references to the game it's based on, which is always nice. \nBut no matter the amount of nods, nothing really matters if the characters don't feel like the ones from the games, and I think this is the manga's biggest flaw. \nCrash Bandicoot is a simple character, a silent goof, good natured but not really that intelligent. I wouldn't think it would be hard to translate him to paper, but they still manage to fail miserably. The first problem was probably giving him a voice, but I'd be able to forgive that if Crash wasn't a annoying character here.\nHere he's a selfish, lazy and dumb character who works only for his own self-interest which is basically eating and there's also that thing where's doing all of this because he wants girls to be interested in him, but besides the first chapter it's only talked about a couple other times in the story. \nYou don't feel like Crash is the \"hero\" of the story here, and you will more likely hate him than love him. \nAku Aku and Cortex are, for the most part, acceptable variants of their game coutnerparts though. \nThe second biggest problem with this manga is that, for a gag manga, more than half the jokes just fall flat. And they don't stop, it's like everything is either a joke or a set-up for one. \nAnd finally the other big problem is that it's incomplete. The manga was cancelled, maybe due to it's mediocrity, but that leaves us without a proper conclusion or much development at all. To be fair I wouldn't know if I'd want it to continue much more as bearing through 14 chapters was already tiring, but it does leave you with a bit of a bad taste when you reach that last page.\nAll in all, it's hard to reccomend this manga to even the die hard fans of the franchise. Yes, it's a novel little extra in the series, but not even with that in mind is this all that enjoyable. If you still want to give it a try after knowing all this, please go ahead, but consider yourself warned."}, {"id": 4412, "score": 30, "body": "My opinion changed so drastically after watching this movie for a second time that I felt compelled to write a review.\n\nThis review may contain very mild spoilers for both of the Broly movies.\n\nWhen I first saw this movie, I thought it was so good but then I watched it again when it came out on DVD. There are a lot of problems with this movie and I think that most people will never see them because they are blinded by nostalgia like I was when I first saw it.\n\nNow, I will acknowledge the fact that this is a different movie from the 1994 Broly movie but it is supposed to be the same character that we all know and love. Otherwise, what would be the point in making another movie about him? While Broly is still completely insane and extremely powerful and his father, Parragus is still a scumbag that tries to use his son as a tool for revenge (which actually makes no sense because the revenge he seeks is for for the mistreatment of his son in the first place), he is in fact, not the same character. The Broly of old does not care for his father while the new one seems to care for him a great deal. This wouldn't be an issue if his father wasn't so horrible to him (Paragus squanders the only friendship that Broly ever had). Furthermore, Broly was an absolute monster in the 1994 version. He was merciless and only sought after destruction. For example, when Paragus realized that the planet was meeting its end, he tried to flee on his own. Once Broly caught wind of the fact that his father intends to abandon him, he decided that it was time for Paragus to meet his maker. In the new movie, you never really get to see this side of Broly. Actually, it isn't until Paragus dies that Broly goes completely bonkers and starts letting loose on his surroundings. I could go on for days about this but basically, Broly is different and it is not in a good way.\n\nLet us now talk about something that doesn't necessarily have anything to do with the story. The fight scenes are really cool in this movie. Even the semi-janky 3D parts were pretty good. I love the look of this movie at all times and I think that in a way, it was a means to compensate for the poor reputation of Dragon Ball Super (the series) in terms of its animation. However, good animation can be both a blessing and a curse. I feel that the animation of a movie or series often plays a huge role in why most people decide whether or not they like that movie or series as a whole. For example, \"Your Name\" is a decent movie, but without its beautiful animation, I highly doubt that it would have been such a well-received movie because the story was quite nonsensical. The same goes for this movie.\n\nSpeaking of nonsense, plot holes are very prominent in Dragon Ball Super: Broly. For some reason, people will say \"that's a cheap shot\" when they read this. Perhaps, because the Dragon Ball series isn't known for having the most well-put together plot but as with any series, there is a limit to how many one can \"let slide\" so to speak. In the interest of time, I will only use one example. The shock collar that Paragus uses on Broly is pretty much the same in both movies. The only reason I find it problematic in this movie, is the fact that both Broly and Paragus were stranded on a remote planet without any way of contacting the rest of the multi-verse (as Piccolo would say) in the new movie, whereas in the old movie, they were living on a planet that had its occupants enslaved by Paragus.\n\nOverall, Dragon Ball Super: Broly is not a good movie. While it isn't a bad-looking movie, it is still a very bad movie. This is due mostly in part to the fact that the newer Broly character is a shell of his former self which is what made the 1994 movie so special. \n\nIf you disagree with me after reading all of this review, I encourage you to watch the movie again. If somehow you still disagree with me, I encourage you to write me letting me know why.\nYou found this review helpful."}, {"id": 4420, "score": 40, "body": "A Sister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s All You Need is the greatest sister fucking fantasy since Sister Act. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an anime that is so similar to Eromanga Sensei it could probably be sued. The only real difference between this and Eromanga is that the characters here are older, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no sister to fuck, and the lewd humor and sex pervert stuff is directed at appropriately aged girls (who look like they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seven). But for all the differences, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of similarities. Light novel writing, sister sex perversions, and absolutely nothing happening for twelve episodes. Yay! I love watching things that have no reason for existing.\n\nItsuki is a light novel writer who fantasizes about having a little sister he can molest. He writes books to fulfill this fantasy. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the protagonist of a show. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m supposed to empathize with him and want to see him succeed. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m supposed to connect with him. Fun fact: I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. As a person with a little sister I can safely say I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never had fantasies toward her. Well, maybe before she lost half her teeth and turned into a mummy. Meth always thwarts sister complexes.\n\nItsuki has to face deadlines and other stuff that author\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face. His editor is crazy.\n\nHe has a girl who is his friend who is a sex pervert. And another girl who is his friend despite the fact he called her a slut in their initial encounter.\nAnd some guy who pretends to be gay to get lady fans.\n\nAnd Itsuki also has a little brother who is feminine and wears panties. Which makes me wonder if Itsuki isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually in love with his little brother but has a sister complex to try and tamp down his gay incestuous fantasies.\n\nSo um...what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good about this anime? I guess it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s occasionally kind of funny in a shocking \u00e2\u0080\u009cdid she just say/do that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d kind of way. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not how you eat an egg!\n\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bad about the anime? Everything else really. A lot of the humor falls flat because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not a ten year old who laughs heartily when a girl says she has to be naked in order to write. And even ten year old's would question the logic behind airing out your crotch to write better. Trust me, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve tried writing novels naked before and every time they kick me out of the Starbucks before I can type \u00e2\u0080\u009cChapter One\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nAnd the humor off-sets the seriousness of certain scenes making for a jumble of tones. When one character has his light novel adapted into an anime, all the friends sit around to watch the premiere while he keeps track of fan discussion on Twitter. When the anime is poorly received and the episode is garbage, I felt a pang of hurt for this guy I barely knew. And I wondered why A Sister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s All You Need isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a slice of life detailing the struggles and trials of a light novel writer in an emotionally complex way. Because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obvious the author can manage that, he does it pretty well in a couple scenes. You know, the scenes that stuck with me and made me wish this weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so pandering.\n\nBut even disregarding the humor the games really screw up the pacing. There are episodes of this anime where our heroes sit around playing tabletop games. We get the rules and we watch people do something so boring the last time you did it was to appease your grandparents who didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what a video game was. So the anime is a sex comedy...and a slice of life drama about writing...and a slice of life about tabletop games?\n\nDid the author think that because he can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come up with anything to say he better throw in some tabletop gaming to blow a chunk of the page count? This anime and Eromanga have helped paint the light novel industry as a dumpster fire of a literary genre. Nothing screams quality like squeezing bad authors with generic ideas till they shit something moderately readable that wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pass for bad fan fiction in most literary circles.\n\nI Wish I Had a Little Sister to Pork is nowhere near as bad as the name makes it sound but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also way more shallow than it tries to be. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a huge splatter of diarrhea rather than a solid turd; an outpouring of too many tones and genres that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t compliment each other and make for a pointless twelve episodes.

It is an anime so terrible only the lowest common denominator of human being can enjoy it. \n\nAn anime so terrible it essentially rips off the plot of the author\u00e2\u0080\u0099s previous series because he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too lazy to come up with something not involving fucking his sister. \n\nAn anime so terrible it contains every trope in anime existence to the point where you wonder if the author has ever had an original idea in his life. \n\nAn anime so terrible you wonder if it was only made because the author is so mentally handicapped that the producers and studio got a tax write-off for adapting his work.\n\nWhy are there loud bootsteps in the stairway outside my apartment? Shut the fuck up! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m trying to bitch about anime!\n\nHave you ever looked at your sister and thought, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh man, I hope I get to that before dad does\u00e2\u0080\u009d? Because I did. And ever since my family has never spoken to me again. Apparently the same thing happened to the author of Eromanga Sensei. It must be hard writing a love letter like this to your sister only for her to disown you and never want to speak to you again. I mean, is it so wrong to want to have sex with a relative? Isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that Alabama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s state motto?\n\nThe main character of Eromanga Sensei is a light novel author at fifteen. He thinks it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to produce books and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s super confident in his novels. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an affront to any person who has ever wanted to be or is an author. If you look at your manuscript and feel so full of yourself about it, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing something wrong. Even published authors are entirely self-conscious about their works and will tell you that they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t proud of even something others consider a masterpiece. You know why? Because artists aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Chads. This guy is the most annoying human being ever and the fact he can produce a novel in a week goes to show that light novels, if this is in fact autobiographical on the part of the author, are the cancer that is killing anime.\n\nOh, his sister lives in her room, probably never showers, and won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go outside. She just sits in there drawing lewd pictures because she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s twelve and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a questionable hobby for a twelve year old. He doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know the artist for his pervert books is his sister but he finds out. And thus has the catalyst for the worst anime of 2017 and possibly ever set off a chain of the most generic events imaginable.\n\nCAN YOU FUCKS QUIT GOOSESTEPPING OUT THERE? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099M TRYING TO TALK ABOUT SISTER FUCKING!\n\nSoon we meet a girl named Elf. She has blond hair and elf ears for whatever reason. If she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fourteen I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say I love her but just between you and me I love her. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an author as well. Eromanga Sensei has forever painted light novel authors as moronic teenagers. I hope that was the intent.\n\nAnyway, Elf is a chuni and rich as hell and she just happens to buy the Victorian mansion that just happens to be next door to the main characters house where he just happens to find her playing piano naked because she just happened to leave the window open and she just happens to find inspiration when she plays the piano naked because this all makes sense and is totally not an excuse for a sick-o who would be arrested or put in a mental institution anywhere else in the world to masturbate to his fantasy elf girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s naked fourteen year old body.\n\nOh, and now she loves the main character! But she better watch out cuz sis is gonna be really jealous even though she shows no outward indication of loving her brother, is constantly treating him like shit, and they never spend enough time together to have any sort of meaningful character development to even warrant the two being in love.\n\nLove triangles are so passe, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s have a love square! Here comes Kimono Girl McIveReadAllYourWorksAndBaselesslyLoveYou. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s read all of his works and baselessly loves him. You see, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually pretty true to how real life works. I was reading Nobokov the other day and wanted so badly to fly to his grave and molest his corpse. Because reading a novel is enough to make you want to fuck an author.\n\nOh, is that gaggle of underage lovemeat not enough for you? How about some girl who randomly shows up at the main dudes door and tells him about how much she loves dicks? Yes, this is the only anime to ever have a character introduction that includes a discussion of dicks.\n\nAnd then there is the lady who works at the bookstore. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the show for three minutes but she asks the main guy to marry her.\n\nBut Izumi, whose name is so forgettable I forgot it until just now, is dedicated to his sister. The sister he spends hardly any time with. The sister who he watches fireworks with through a window.\n\nAnd meanwhile he spends a majority of the series hanging out with Elf. Elf, the rich girl. Elf, the one with an actual character. Elf, the girl who cares. Elf, the girl with development. Elf, the only halfway entertaining character in this fucking show.\n\nWhat does the goddam author have against chuni girls that he has Kuroneko in Oreimo and Elf in this, makes them the best characters, then goes \u00e2\u0080\u009cHar, har, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099d want to date girls who are interesting when you can date the boring sister?\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nJesus fucking Christ is there a parade going on in the hallway? SHUT THE FUCK UP AND LET ME DISCUSS THE SEXUALIZATION OF UNDERAGE GIRLS FOR A MOMENT!\n\nEromanga Sensei is chock full of generic moments that are ripped from every light novel in existence. It constantly reminds you that other light novels exist as if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s begging you to turn it off and read/watch something else. Spice and Wolf shows up to remind you that well thought out and emotional romances exist in anime. Toradora shows up to remind you that well thought out and emotional romances exist in anime. Sword Art Online shows up as if to laugh at you for thinking that was the most bland and dirivitive light novel ever made. Even Oreimo characters show up to remind you that this guy made a show about fucking your sister that was at least mildly entertaining and only slightly less infuriating.\n\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the tournament episode. The late season beach episode. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a festival. They play Twister. The sister and Izumi turn out to be childhood friends through some contrived, ridiculous logic. All of this is bad, all of it is indicative of the creative drought of this author and the general lack of care for quality of the studio in choosing to adapt this show.\n\nBut the sexualization of the underage characters is where this show is at its lowest.\n\nAnime as a medium is typically centered on underage girls. Gelbooru, as a website, is where you go when you want to give in to your basest dirtiest urges about these girls because most anime have the good sense to not sexualize underage girls but many anime fans don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t (*cough* Kanna *cough*).\n\nEromanga Sensei is so resplendent in near pornographic imagery and tasteless crotch, butt, thigh, and tit shots that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m surprised it was allowed to air on television. Every girl is turned into a sex joke at some point, Eromanga herself is a huge pervert, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an actual point where a girl is blindfolded and molested. Making problems even worse is the fact that the Blu-ray release of this series shows that the television version is actually censored. Yes, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right, if you thought this anime about naked teenaged girls was too tame, there is a version where you straight up see their cooches.\n\nIf this intrigues you in any way then please climb to the top of the nearest skyscraper and jump off.\n\nWho the hell knocks on the door at two-thirty in the morning? Goddammit\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\nThe anime ends at episode eleven but as with most anime that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know when to quit, this one goes an extra episode and gives us the most disgusting and hard-to-watch yet. The series literally ends with a scene where a girl has stripped naked her little kindergarten-aged brother in order to draw his dick so Eromanga has a reference on how to draw male anatomy. This is how we end an anime that aired on television. An anime that sold well. An anime that people have rated highly.\n\nIf you or a loved one experienced an erection during Eromanga Sensei, please seek mental help immediately.\n\nHoly shit! My fucking door, why\u00e2\u0080\u0099d you bust it down? Guns? Put those things down I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just reviewing Eromanga Sensei! Get away from me! Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look through my DVD collection!\n\nOh crap, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like this anime! Why are you pigs going to arrest me?\n\nI better write the conclusion before they cuff me\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\nEromanga Sensei is the most disturbing thing to happen to anime since the last most disturbing thing to happen to anime. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s everything wrong with the medium wrapped into one dirivitive, unfunny, boring, and pointless package. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an anime that shits on writing, it shits on anime, and shits on human decency. It asks you to step into the shoes of a main character so pathetic he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather date his characterless and useless sister than a character he spends more time with and helps develop. It assails you with more pedophilic imagery than fucking Salo: The 140 Days. Eromanga only exists to make you hate the light novel industry, hate anime, and hate the fact that a medium you dedicate your time and passion toward is chock full of enough weirdos who enjoy trash like this that Eromanga will get a second season before (Insert title of anime that will never get a second season).\n\nNot so tight! Why are you reading me my Miranda Rights? I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do anything! I hated this anime. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trash. Hey, get off my laptop. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t click that folder!\n\nNO THOSE AREN\u00e2\u0080\u0099T MY PICTURE OF ELF-CHAN.\n\nI AM NOT INTO THAT. SOMEONE ELSE PUT THEM THERE.\n\nI AM NOT A LOLICON!\n\nYou see, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s naked because playing the piano while nude gives her ideas for novels officer.

The girl is a fairy, and a young one: Just a few thousand years and no care in the world for consistent stories. Of course, if only you'd known then what you know now... Here you are now in her hands, pursuing a quest of alchemy, transmuting things as they go through your esophagus. Yes, seven years of your life have gone and you didn't read that book (or did you?), but you have now become the very medium of your magic (or was it alchemy?). \"Why am doing this again?\", you mutter in awe.\n\nA careless phrase.

Studio [AXsiZ](https://anilist.co/studio/6108/AXsiZ)? They often co-animate with studio Gokumi, and this time they decided to go solo. Huh.\n\nThe story is from Mikage Kasuga, who also did [Oda Nobuna no Yabou](https://anilist.co/anime/11933/Oda-Nobuna-no-Yabou). And there I knew something ticked. The plot says it all: \"the Sengoku period, [but] where all the major Samurai lords are cute girls\". Well, it's all the same shit with Ulysses, you just replace samurais with knights.

Do you have one of the above fetishes? Do you disagree with the epitome of Prison School and rather profess your love of the boob? I SAID DO YOU PROFESS YOUR LOVE OF THE OPPAI BROTHERS AND SISTERS?\n\nI know you do. And so does this show.\n\n_Ulysses: Jeanne d'Arc to Renkin no Kishi_ is a show that takes its roots in the eponym light novel by Mikage Kasuga, who has already a past of ~~improving~~ tweaking history to its ~~liking~~ fetishes - but I already covered that point earlier. The story takes place in medieval France and centers on Montmorency (full name Gilles de Rais), a character that really existed. The man was actually even stranger in reality than on screen: versed in the occult and known help of Jeanne d'Arc, he ended up convicted of murdering hundreds of children. As a mad storyteller, you cannot choose a richer character inspiration. And Mikage Kasuga _is_ a mad storyteller. So he tells the \"adventure\" of both of them as they ~~kiss~~ fight to liberate France of the english invading forces. They will meet countless foes and ~~gurls~~ knigths. A real ~~sex ed~~ history course, I told you.\n\nBut all of this would be fine (yes, even the history transformation in a fetish fest) if the show had any direction. Do they liberate France by the end of the show? No. Do they crown the princess? Yes, but it's not shown, they just say crude jokes instead. Do they liberate Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans? Ah yes, finally, but it's only a half-assed closure that involved a FUCKING RAILGUN FROM SPACE to regain control of the city. So if there is a direction, it's definitely not historical.\n\nRomance? Not a direction either. They definitely rely on the lolicon side of things (which incidentaly was also the\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 thing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 of the [original Montmorency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_de_Rais#Child_murders). So if there's a direction, it's on the loli side of things.\n\nimg600(https://i.imgur.com/FHdjixT.png)\nimg600(https://i.imgur.com/6NiCzVx.jpg)\n\nAction? Oh god not with that animation. I'll let you judge.\n\nimg600(https://i.imgur.com/Nj9h2sz.gif)\n\nDrawing quality? Swords bigger than the wielder are common things, but if you don't know how to draw faces/abs or running scenes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\nimg600(https://i.imgur.com/DANoxI9.jpg)\nimg600(https://i.imgur.com/BxGJBYl.jpg)\n\nMedieval fashion? Rather, they grew tired of drawing clothes at some point.\n\nimg600(https://i.imgur.com/ki7P0Gj.jpg)\nimg600(https://i.imgur.com/YbrAHIT.jpg)\n\nEcchi then? That's the bait, but (sadly) not the theme.\n\nimg600(https://i.imgur.com/3JEKl0b.jpg)\n\nSuspense? Puh-lease. Throwing WTF every episode is not creating suspense, just surprise. Yes, that counts the Darlifra-like alien trump card in late-season, and the (beautifully drawn) tentacles:\n\nimg600(https://i.imgur.com/7xtNU9o.jpg)\n\nOn that note, the show spends a large part around the Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans bridge (which is justified by history - but not really supported by the storytelling) and doesn't show much inspiration in battles to take it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 until the end, that is. BECAUSE YES, THE ONLY SCENARIO RESOLUTION THAT THEY COULD FIND WAS TO DESTROY IT WITH AN ORBITAL LASER IN MEDIEVAL TIMES\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I don't have words for this. I would have expected anything but alien ships to blow that fucking Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans bridge. Well done, Ulysse, well done. I don't care that they flipped the whole scenario late-game, but it just has no coherence with the atmospheree setup by previous episodes, and doesn't contribute to build characters either, so it is just bullshit to fill three episodes at that point. So yes, no spoiler. There's nothing to spoil anyway.\n\nimg600(https://i.imgur.com/lb7rY89.jpg)\n\"Ship in the Sky\"? \"Respond to my *voice*\"?

Yes but don't expect to have a proper conversation with actual french people, or you may end up cuffled and marked as a sex offender. Yes, each episode ends with a \"lesson\" translated from what a character said in the episode. And no, it's not \"surpisingly useful\", just\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 meh. The translation on-screen is actually wrong too, but who cares at that point.\n\nimg600(https://i.imgur.com/MvAMiPP.jpg)\n\nCharacter development and breathtaking battles? Almost all antagonists are but caricatures of themselves:\n\nimg600(https://i.imgur.com/mj1oFKH.jpg)\n\nThe only character transformation that is fitting is the battle-Jeanne, with her upset mood and strength:\n\nimg600(https://i.imgur.com/MuPa75B.jpg)\nimg600(https://i.imgur.com/weYBRxf.jpg)\nimg600(https://i.imgur.com/gehZJV1.png)\n\n# Questions\n\nI HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS, even after watching it twice. I have found (unsatisfying) answers on fandom wikis (hugh) for some of them, but I'm not writing this review to provide answers (much in a gamebook, you have to answer them for yourself):\n\n- why tentacles?\n- why ulysses? _nothing_ else relates to the Odyssey.\n- wtfh is ulysses noire?\n- where are the scenes shown in the OP?\n- why different ED when a single, boring one would have sufficed?\n- why english have daemon-hunters?\n- why fairies?\n- why excalibur and why is it in France?\n- why is everything explained by a war of gods?\n- why have I watched this till the end?\n- why am I writing a review about it?\n- why is a knight named B\u00c3\u00a2tard (meaning \"bastard\") and why is he crossdressing?\n- why is a knight named La Tremouille (meaning \"very soppy\")?\n- why is 'pure' Jeanne vs 'evil' Jeanne used a plot twist when it's been seen since the beginning of the show?\n- why is Jeanne put at the stake with no context?\n- why is Richemont fighting for both sides?\n- why is everything beginning with all characters at the same school?\n- how is Montmorency spending seven years without food, water or even realising it?\n- why is there a fairy following Montmorency?\n- why is Jeanne d'Arc living with the fairies at first?\n- why a spaceship? (and why dead aliens inside? AND WHY FLOATING FEATHERS??)\n- why has the budget for this trash fire not been given to produce a S2 of Oda Nobuna no Yabou instead?\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe following yonkoma manga is actually a better story than Ulysses.\n\nimg600(https://i.imgur.com/OOVK6KI.jpg)\n(actually a collage of paintings representing battles of the Hundred Years' War. Clockwise, from top left: La Rochelle with ~~space~~ships, Agincourt, Patay, Orleans).\n\nIn Ulysses, nothing happens. Nothing evolves. It's just your common fetishes put in the mixer with some legends and language puns. I wouldn't recommend it unless you want the weird thrill of watching something jokingly absurd (which I do enjoy\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 sometimes). Morbid curiosity and severe masochism count too. Or wait maybe it's the proper way to teach children histor--\n\nBACK TO YOUR STORY\n\nTwo paths open ahead of you. One, thorny, involves watching Ulysses and redeeming your occular virginity (if any such thing exists on Anilist). The other, harder, consists in erasing the stain left in your mind by the extracts of Ulysses contained in this review, and cleaning with acid the now corrupt inodes of the computer displaying these images.\n\nWhat will you choose?\n"}, {"id": 4466, "score": 30, "body": "After the realease of Gen Urobuchi's Puella Magi Madoka Magica back in 2011, there wasn't a big number of new animes that attempted to deconstruct popular anime genres targetted mainly towards kids, like Madoka did with magical girls, despite Madoka's success. \nOne of the exceptions was Mari Okada's Selector Infected WIXOSS, that tried to do the same with card game animes. The first problem is, despite the show attempting to gave the Madoka treatment to card anime game, it seems like Okada or anybody else in the production staff haven't watch a single epiosde of a card game anime in their entire life. While Madoka uses some of the most common elemnts and tropes you can afind an any magical girl anime, specially Pretty Cure. To make matters worse, we barely see any of the games in the anime, most of the events related to the games happen off-screen. So don't expect epic battles.\nOkada's territory is teenage melodrama, that's the reason her most popular anime is Ano Hana. And to be fair, there's tons of it here too, but most of the characters feel underdeveloped and unsympathetic, so the watcher has a hard time trying to get invested in what's happening. Soe characters will simply make you want to not root for their desires to came true, despite it was probably Okada's intention to be otherwise, like Yuzuki wanting to bang his own twin brot...sorry, i mean made a gender reversal OreImo. Others will make you feel like their problems are not as hard as they want you to present them so you don't have another solution that risk everything in a magic cards game, like in the case of Hitoe \"I don't have any friends except the ones from my old town who still wrote me letters, and i made two pretty easy in a span of a few episodes\" Uemura.\nAnd don't forget our MC, who is supposed to be, like Madoka, a girl who doesn't know which wish to ask to make it become true, but she enters in the game anyway despite she learns how dangerous it is because, why not. At least when you become a magical girl you save people's lives.\nLike i wrote above, there's an incest subplot in this anime, and it makes this show pretty uncomfortable to watch. On of the main character has been in love with her twin brother since she was just a little kid, and has enter the game hoping that if she wins it her wish will be granted. And it's pretty obvious that Okada wants us to root for her, downright to incluiding a secondary female character who's the twin brother's classmate and later girlfriend, than acts all jealous of the relationship her boyfrined has with his sister, and when she calls it out she acts all bitchy, she won't gonna take her side. Well, Okada, let me tell, making a douchey character something that's true, doesn't make the thing less true, it only shows you're desperate to make us agree with the characters you want us to agree, because you can think of any other way to fo it, because there's no way some sane will do it.\nDefinitely a skip."}, {"id": 4479, "score": 42, "body": "# [~~~**Can one even spoil Slice of Life?**~~~]()\n<br>\nUmaru-Chan has a nice idea, make an Anime that portrays your local gamer quite well...sadly the Main Character is unbearable.\n\n[**STORY:**]()\nThere is not much to say about Umaru-Chan's story, that's quite understandable for a SOL Anime and this does not mean that the show can be bad.

This character is one of the most annoying ones I saw, she shows no remorse to the mental state of the people around her, she wants something so she gets that something with the power of tears. Her portrayal of a \"Gamer\", as I said numerous times, is quite decent (to a degree), her wasting her time away in games and buying a bunch of collectibles is quite true. The part that starts falling apart is when she goes on her fits of crying and rage when she doesn't get her Gamer Fuel (Cola and Crisps). This aspect of the character is really off putting and just makes you look at ther and say \"What a spoiled brat\".\n\nPretty much everyone else in the show is a decent character though. Each and every one of them have their unique quirks. \nThe brother is what you would call \"Normie\", he doesn't know much about Vidya Geamz and doesn't care that much, he also is the one responsible for Umaru-Chan and her luxurious life style.\n\nSylphynford is quite energetic, she is the rival to Umaru-Chan gamer life. She acts like a nice lady but is quite dumb to say the least. If I'm to be honest with you if she was the Main Character I would probably enjoy the show much more. This is something I can get behind, an Energetic and less annoying version of Umaru.\n\nNana Ebina, best girl of the show, the main reason I haven't dropped it.\nShe is quite shy, she also lives in the same apartment block as Umaru. She is the nicest human in the whole show. She tries her best ot make everyone have fun but kinda struggles due to he intense shy behaviour. She doesn't know anything at all the Life of A Gamer but despite that she still manages to be one of the best.\n\nKirie Motoba, **VERY** shy. She has a gaze that people would call \"Deadly\". People avoid her but she is quite a nice person.\nIn the show she swears to protect Umaru-Chan's Chibi transformation. She will go to great lengths to satisfy the needs of the monster lurking in the house that is *Umaru-Chan*. Quite a decent character if you ask me though her over attached personality kind of makes her not the best.\n~~~img420(https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/102856003020751083/160480CE361D39ABB35876A0FA583FC0F7A8A8D0/)~~~\n<br>\n\n\n[**ART/ANIMATION:**]()\nUmaru-Chan has quite the average animation, its the usual smooth and yet sometimes choppy due to budget kind of thing we see from a lot of SOL shows. Though the art style does looks quite neat.\nThe art style is nice and vibrant which makes us feel more energetic like the gamers we are.\n~~~img420(https://media1.tenor.com/images/a0b8d2041336fa12e63ea8c0db7a2234/tenor.gif?itemid=9219493)~~~\n<br>\n\n\n[**MUSIC:**]()\nThe OP is....quite catchy actually. It has Umaru's high pitched voice yeah but the beat and lyrics sound actually really good. I've been listening to it a few times.\nThe ED on the other hand...well it sounds...decent I suppose. Nothing that unique and quite forgetable. Its much slower compared to the OP and has normal vocals from Umaru and the rest of the cast but still, just not as catchy as the fast paced OP.\n~~~img420(https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/991/368/908.gif)~~~\n<br>\n\n\n[**OVERALL OPINION:**]()\nHimouto! Umaru-Chan is a show centered around the Otaku culture and more on the \"Gamer\" aspect. Its portrayal is decent to a degree, at least in my opinion. Her addiction to playing games and collecting items is very true to me. But the part that really throws me off is the incredibly annyoing main. She cries and cries and rages a second can't pass without her crying or raging. If they toned down that aspect then I believe this show would've been a 6.8/10."}, {"id": 4486, "score": 30, "body": "~~~__Just Because is confusing. _Confusingly_ bad.__~~~\nAnd I mean it. The story's bland, the characters are bland and so are the visuals. I just expected a romance/slice-of-life show with 12 episodes to entertain me for a short while but what I got was, like, the slowest and most painful experience of my entire life. \nI shall explain in greater detail.\n\nI'll try to avoid any spoilers but basically it's about a guy (_whose name I forgot as he's so forgettable_) who returns to his home town to finish high school while reconnecting with his old friends again. \nThe thing is, we've seen this plotline at least 9000 times now, and it doesn't help that the story has an incredibly slow pace. \nThe plot is just so unimaginably lethargic and we get all the typical clich\u00c3\u00a9s that someone would expect from a romance-drama. It doesn't add anything new to the genre nor is it unpredictable. The ending was so expectable I felt like they had a preset of all shows of this genre and mashed them all together.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, then the characters will deliver the final blow. \nOur MC is Mr. Bland Forgettable. I don't even remember what his background was, he doesn't show any emotions through the whole ordeal and could easily be replaced by someone else.\nHis friend, with whom he regularly plays baseball (is this of any purpose? It certainly does not seem like it.), is just as unmemorable  and cardboard-cutout-like. He is interested in Girl B who plays the trumpet. That's honestly the only thing I can say about her.\nThe romantic interest (Girl A) is not really interested in Mr. Forgettable until the plot says otherwise. They have little to no chemistry at all and generally seem very distant. But at least they fit as a couple as they both never show their emotions, never do something to bring them any closer and are basically dead inside.\nThey all have something in common, though. They all lack interesting or unusual traits or any redeeming features.\nThe only character that would stand out is the leader of the photo club, who is energetic and somewhat likable but even she can't save the ship from sinking into _deep, ice-cold water_.\n\nThe visuals were okay, but honestly, nothing outstanding or memorable. I personally thought the characters were kind of unpleasant to look at, which I can't explain, but that might be just me.\nThe soundtrack just follows up. The opening is okay, but the ending is really nothing special. \nThe scenes where Girl B plays her trumpet were trying to convey feels and emotions (I think?) but it didn't hit anything. It is kind of awkward sitting there and seeing a girl play a trumpet to cardboard-friend and that's it.\n\nMy final verdict: Just Because suffers from the slowest storyline ever, _period_. The characters are unimaginative and add to the miserery that is Just Because. It really was a pure waste of time.\nThe premise actually got me interested but the actual thing was so disappointing with so many obvious flaws. Everything is outstandingly sub-par and the only thing that was moderately watchable was the drama in the second half of the show.\n\nEven if Just Because was designed to be soothing and calming, you just can't snail-pace the damn plot even though it only has 12 episodes.\nThus, if you were to watch a slice-of-life/romance anime of any kind, please, and I mean it, please do not watch this and avoid it at all costs until you are willing to experience real suffering."}, {"id": 4490, "score": 45, "body": "# __S\u00c5\u0082owa wst\u00c4\u0099pu__\nZabra\u00c5\u0082em si\u00c4\u0099 do tego tytu\u00c5\u0082u nie ze wzgl\u00c4\u0099du na g\u00c5\u0082\u00c3\u00b3wn\u00c4\u0085 tematyk\u00c4\u0099 tego anime (no mo\u00c5\u00bce troch\u00c4\u0099), ale przede wszystkim ze wzgl\u00c4\u0099du na popularno\u00c5\u009b\u00c4\u0087 mangi oraz adaptacji anime.

Alright. _Alright._~~~\n\nThere's some manga where like... sure, it looks bad. Like okay yeah sure, this series probably isn't gonna be very good. But I remember for this series, I felt it down to my very bones the moment I saw the first page of this series.\n\n~~~img500(https://i.imgur.com/WRcfMnc.png)~~~\n\n~~Once again I proffer yet another _Apologize to Friedrich Nietzsche_ in one of these reviews.~~\n\nI didn't exactly have a full premonition of what was to come. But an ominous sense of dread took hold of me. \n\nThis manga is not a good series. This manga is not a so bad it's good series. This manga is not smut. This manga is not a funny death game series to laugh at. This manga is the crystallized form of a person's inner negativity and ugliness towards the world, technology, younger people, school, and there is absolutely no purpose behind any of it other than just for the sake of negativity.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/BZkk1SJ.png)\n\nWhich perhaps on its own, I could be fine with dismissing. You wanted to do an overly negative series, you wanted to do a series that was only depressing, fine. _Fine!_ But that's not what's happening here. After all the awfulness and just... horrible shit in this manga, on top of this stupid ass muddled death game angle, they actually tried to hastily vomit a positive spin they could attach to this and even after that...\n\n___This series genuinely makes me feel sick to my stomach.___ \n\nimg(https://i.imgur.com/qPd2Ks1.png)\n\nI feel nothing but hatred for all those involved. There is absolutely no silver lining anywhere beyond the fact that after I post this review, I will never think of this series ever again throughout the rest of my life.\n\nBut for the time being, I'll fight negativity with more negativity. So if you choose to continue reading this review beyond this point, I would advise you to brace yourself in more ways than one. \n\nThere's going to be a lot of unpleasantness. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/Ap8cWOJ.png)\n\n___\n\n#Introduction and Death Games#\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/c64pz3b.png)\n\nIkenie Touhyou is a manga drawn by [Edogawa Edogawa](https://anilist.co/staff/123443/Edogawa-Edogawa) and the story is by [Ryuuya Kasai](https://anilist.co/staff/123442/Ryuuya-Kasai). I'm unsure if the manga is actually the original, as it may very well be like Ousama Game and be a cell phone novel that for some reason was adapted into a manga. And then at some point in the manga's publication, it also received a light novel...\n\n~~~img200(https://i.imgur.com/Q3TlSq8.jpg)~~~\n\nAnd I just can't help but notice that the characters on that light novel cover look infinitely preferable to the way the characters look drawn by Edogawa Edogawa. But then I immediately think of the bee mascot and everything that happens in this manga and think maybe the ugly characters fit better.\n\nimg1000(https://i.imgur.com/S4r3mw2.png)\n\n~~Also while the characters may look 200% more appealing, you would also have to read this series in _novel_ form.~~\n\nSo, Ikenie Touhyou is a death game series. I am by no means an expert on these as including this, I've unfortunately been exposed to a grand total of two. But there's something immediate you can take away from just seeing the words \"DEATH GAME.\"\n\nThere's going to be a game and the consequences for losing the game are going to be death, right? A bunch of death game series are unfortunately shoved into the horror genre, but Ikenie Touhyou fortunately isn't one of those. Still, just because it's not considered horror doesn't mean there's not gonna be any death, right?\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/1AC4NBE.png)\n\nI think there's maybe like two. The one above is of course completely unrelated to Sacrificial Vote. ~~If she had just remembered to look both ways before crossing the street, she would have been fine.~~ Not counting the suicides that caused both rounds of Sacrificial Vote in the first place.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/WqXYtWn.png)\n\nNo, rather than actual deaths which I would be way more worried about, the death Ikenie-kun usually deals in is \"social\" death. When somebody is voted for or when Ikenie just fucking feels like it, he'll reveal the voted for person's darkest secret to everybody else in the class. And... really, that's it. Something awful is revealed about you. There's no guarantee that you have to freak the fuck out about it or have a psychological breakdown, as one character eventually reveals in the latter half of the manga.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/6TTzREA.png)\n\nSo the few amount of actual deaths feel pretty shoehorned in or just completely unnecessary. And the social deaths just make you feel disgusted. Not at the social deaths themselves, but the fact that you're _actually reading this manga._ Like okay sure, this student who's being Mr. Positive and trying to lead the class through Sacrificial Vote immediately gets a social death and of course it's his mother celebrating his birthday and then proceeding to insert a ___CENSORED___ into his ___CENSORED___ and it's like...\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/lwKflqm.png)\n\nLike immediately he's gone. And that's like how 90% of the social deaths are handled. Something fucking horrible about this character is shown and then bam, immediately removed from the manga. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/U8j3VM5.png)\n\nI mean, am I understating the horror behind the idea of something that horrible you've kept secret just suddenly being revealed online to basically everyone you know? Sure.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/0cVRN9N.png)\n\nBut couldn't the students have _just been killed instead?_ Like. Rather than Sacrificial Vote, ___DEATH VOTE.___ You get voted for and bam, the bee becomes real and flies out of your phone and immediately pierces your brain with a giant bee stinger.\n\n~~Ikenie-kun isn't even a fucking bee at all. That's just how he exists in my brain because of I guess just his striped shirt but I'm just gonna keep referring to him as a bee because what the hell else would I call this fucked up creature???~~\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/c7i7sAy.png)\n\nIt'd still be stupid as all hell ~~and admittedly less interesting~~, but at least I wouldn't have to feel like I need to take a goddamned shower after reading it and/or I could laugh at it rather than feel seething hatred.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/QgwxFye.png)\n\nAnyways, that's enough about the social deaths for right now. What about the \"game\" aspect? Well, you would think like voting is pretty cut and dried. Except no, if it was just a ballot every single time, the manga would be pretty boring right? After all, there can't be any tension whatsoever if like the moment everybody votes the result is 100% decided.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/HEfHnLn.png)\n\nThis whole voting app bullshit thing was supposed to be revenge for the dead teacher but oh I don't know, if you tap on my side project clicker game site a preposterous amount of times, then I'll just cast the results of the vote aside. Because fuck it. \n\nAlternatively, you can just get stabbed and that'll get you a free pass for the round.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/kfbAxpC.png)\n\nOh hey, did you change to a new phone to try and escape the app? Well fuck you, you get a social death ___RIGHT NOW.___\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/SnlPRr4.png)\n\n\"oh look at the time, it's time to give out the resul--GOTCHA! EVEN THOUGH IT WAS THE MOST PREDICTABLE THING IN THE WORLD, I'M GONNA DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT _THIS_ TIME! CAUSE ___FUCK IT!___\"\n\n~~And also every single time the manga tries to make it seem like \"OH THIS PERSON IS TOTALLY GONNA BE VOTED FOR\", it's always someone else. It can't ever be surprising if you just KEEP DOING IT.~~\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/yKBDpZm.png)\n\nYou know, it's funny. There's actually two different Ikenie-kun's and the one in the latter half of the manga seems to share his predecessor's cavalier attitude about shaking things up. And I mean sure there's actually a plot reason for it, but like... just starting Sacrificial Vote up again, and then immediately punishing the one person who decided to vote...\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/41zMqDV.png)\n\nLike the whole thing is supposed to be the voting. It's the \"game\" aspect of this fucking death game manga, and it's just completely fucked. When you try and set shit like this up and then decide to not have stable rules, it just becomes a bunch of complete and utter nonsense.\n\nNeo-Ikenie literally misses doing the Sacrificial Vote results one day and fucking apologizes to everyone just so he can fucking go _\"HA, PRANKED YA! OF COURSE I'M GONNA GIVE THE RESULTS BUT I'M GONNA DO IT TOMORROW! GOTTA DRAG THIS SHIT OUT AS LONG AS POSSIBLE YOU FUCKS.\"_\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/H3UrL7G.png)\n\n...Why am I still fucking talking about this stuff? This is not what is important about this manga. What is important is that\n\n___\n\n#LIFE IS SHIT.#\n\n~~~img500(https://i.imgur.com/HwEEaWr.png)~~~\n\nThat, is the crowning message that this series wants to get across to you. ___There is no fucking light at the end of the tunnel.___ \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/DHHuUXM.png)\n\nEvery fucking single person around you in your classroom or at your job has some fucking horrible dark secret no matter how fucking large of a smile they have on their face. Like really, every single goddamned student in these classes are just having sex with teachers, driving people to suicide, they're extorting each other for sex, killing cats for fun, being defecated upon, and so forth.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/dBm4uOA.png)\n\nAnd those kids and their ___goddamned smartphones___ and that fucking ___internet nonsense.___ They're recording everything with those fucking phones. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/IDHdoVW.png)\n\nEvery single detail of your private life and every single secret? It's in the data of a smartphone just waiting to be uploaded to the internet and then all your friends and family members will swoop down on that shit and throw you to the ___goddamned wolves.___\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/wT9HUje.png)\n\nNo loyalty! No human decency! The cherry on top of the shit sundae of this manga is that once you finished reading the series to the point where it should have logically concluded, it _restarts_.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/JvEfRHE.png)\n\nBut not only does it restart, everything is just opposite. Rather than a teacher being driven insane and to suicide by her students, a student is driven to suicide and the teachers not only don't give a shit but they try and cover her suicide up. Like no matter how different the social deaths are and shit it's literally the exact same bullshit.\n\nThe conclusion to the first half would have been a fine conclusion to the manga as a whole. Everybody of these shitfucks that are still around gets their secrets put on the internet, and main girl forces the culprit behind Ikenie-kun to not commit suicide and instead live the rest of her life in prison.\n\nInstead, main girl becomes a teacher and life's good and oh no there's Ikenie-kun again. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/fxzbetR.jpg)\n\nWhat's her solution this time as Sacrificial Vote 2.0 just completely fucking falls off the rails and like a fucking civil war between students and teachers erupts?\n\nMain girl eventually says \"okay fuck it. The only conclusion I can think of is I guess me quitting? Like the entire fucking class was in on this shit this time, so fuck it. I'M OUT.\"\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/8tE2eAo.png)\n\n~~Don't you get it??? She was the Sacrificial Vote all alooooooooooooooooooooong. She sacrificed her job and everything became good again yay what a satisfying ending~~\n\nAnd you know what? She was right. So much so that's exactly how I'm ending this review. ___Fuck this shitty ass goddamned garbage series.___ Like I essentially said at the start of this review, if it was just the desire to draw high schoolers being horrible to each other and having sex with teachers and extorting and blackmailing each other... or just the desire to make a generally horrifically pessimistic and downer series, fine. I mean, it'd still be a terrible series, but _FINE._\n\nBut you're gonna fucking try at the very last second to put a happy ending spin on this nonsense?\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/sn4BvMM.png) \n\n___Fuck offfffffffffffffffffffffffff.___ \n\nAnd the fucking post-credits stinger scene with a giant Ikenie-kun 3.0 showing up on the side of a skyscraper about to start a nationwide round of Sacrificial Vote was fucking the absolute most pathetic thing in this entire goddamned series.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/ElYWwe9.png)\n\nLike _what the fuck was that?_ Was there actually a third part where the entire nation takes part planned but it got axed??? Like Ikenie-kun isn't an actual deity or being. It's just a program that was created by one singular person. Then the second one was made by the second class? So who made the third one? Why did they want to take revenge on all of Japan? What???\n\n...\n\n...Okay no yeah fuck this, a __1 out of 100.__ I don't recommend it. Even for ~~fellow~~ masochists, no. Don't do this. Don't do this to yourself. It's not worth it...\n\n~~~img500(https://i.imgur.com/PmuAM86.png)~~~"}]}
