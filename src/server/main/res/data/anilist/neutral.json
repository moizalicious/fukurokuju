{"reviews": [{"id": 252, "score": 60, "body": "Now, I'd like to start by saying how fantastic it is that there's any new Urusei Yatsura production at all so long after the series has ended and been followed by two or three successors (depending on whether or not you count Maison Ikkoku). The opening animation involving the casts of Urusei Yatsura, Ranma \u00c2\u00bd, and InuYasha is an absolute fangasm for anyone who enjoyed all three series, especially considering how disappointingly rare anime crossovers in general tend to be.\r\n\r\nThat said, this special struggled a little bit in living up to its original series. The general antics of the show were still there, but the whole thing has been modernized to some degree. As far as the production values go, again, it's fantastic to see what the series might have looked like had it been made today rather than 20 years ago, but it fell short in a few other areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n __Writing__... now, the story has never been a strong point of Urusei Yatsura. It's just not a show that you watch for gripping drama or to find out what's gonna happen to such-and-such's divorced sister this week. It's a fun, wacky, very episodic ride that you tune into to just have a good time for 20 minutes or so, with a couple of very brief story arcs sprinkled about. The Obstacle Course Swim Meet did not break that pattern. It had a nice little story pulled right from the manga with plenty of wacky antics that wrapped up in a cool 25 minutes, like most episodes. In that sense, it lived up to the series just fine.\r\n\r\n __Art:__ If you were to watch the original series, and if you were to then watch this episode, the difference in the production values in terms of the artwork would be plain to see. They were made two decades apart, so it should be no surprise that they really revamped this series for the 21st century... and I don't mean that negatively. It's really fun to see the characters drawn in a modern way--to see what might have been, if only for one brief episode. The most recent animation for the series prior to this was from 1991, so the jump is quite large and fascinating to witness.\r\n\r\n __Sound:__ Being one of the series that, despite its immense popularity in Japan (and even on a global scale), never really found its market Stateside, Urusei Yatsura never received a dedicated English dub. One brief attempt was made for the series, and the movies were covered with the same (rather shoddy) cast, but no final cut was made--so, as of right now, no English version of this special exists and I rather doubt there are any plans for one. It is extremely impressive, however, that the studio was able to reunite the entire (to my ears) original Japanese cast of the show from so long ago for this production, and it's great to hear those voices again with a truly astounding level of consistency, given the leap. The music also manages to live up to the original series's soundtrack while still being reworked for the modern era.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat really hurts this special relative to the classic series, OVA's, and movies from years prior, however, is the directing. The style of humor is fairly consistent much of the time, but others... it becomes clear that some crude influences have been allowed into the script. A few tacky fart jokes and other such humor have wormed their way in, as well as one or two \"random face\" gags... both of which were rarely, if ever, implemented in the original series. The humor was never some persnickety high-brow display of \"cultural etiquette,\" or anything, but it had some standards, and the bar was definitely lowered for this piece of animation.\r\n\r\nThat aside, as I've said, it was a real treat to see the series re-imagined after all this time, and anyone who's seen and enjoyed Urusei Yatsura should absolutely not miss out on the experience. If you haven't seen the series, however, I wouldn't advise that you make this your introduction to it.\r\n\r\n(Unrelated: Keep an eye out for cameos in the episode! Akane and Kagome both make appearances, as do Godai and Kyoko from  [Maison Ikkoku](http://anilist.co/anime/1453).)"}, {"id": 254, "score": 50, "body": "The first Eizou Hakusho OVA series is essentially a clip show highlighting a few of the fights from Yu Yu Hakusho's Dark Tournament arc running about an hour in total. There is a very small amount of new footage involving Koto trying in futility to get some commentary from the Urameshi team before the tournament finals, but aside from that, these episodes have little to offer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n __Writing:__ The Koto segment is an amusing one, granted, but that said, it only lasts about 60 seconds. After that point, the OVA runs into lengthy cuts from the original series encompassing a few of the fights from the tournament in a semi-abridged format. Thus, there's not a whole lot to say about the story element here, because... well, there just isn't one. As stated previously, it's a clip show.\r\n\r\n __Art:__ The art, of course, doesn't vary at all from the quality present in the original show because... well, it is the original show, in clip format. The new animation with Koto (which I'm forced to continually return to as a reference point, it being the only new piece of new animation presented) held up to the same standards of artwork and animation as the series, so the whole OVA holds up consistently, at the very least.\r\n\r\n __Sound__, though... this is what really hits home. If you were one of the early birds way back in the day and were introduced to the series in its original Japanese language, you shouldn't have any complaints here. If you are like myself and many of the show's fans who fell in love with the inventive and enthusiastic English dub of the show which garnered much popularity on Toonami, prepare to be disappointed. While FUNimation was gracious enough to dub everything else on their Eizou Hakusho release, including the first movie, several bonus features, afterstories, and even some surprisingly fun Japanese anti-piracy clips, they did not dub this series. I can only assume this is due to the fact that Eizou Hakusho II would have been impossible to dub, they were presenting both OVA's together, and wanted to strive for consistency. Still, there was nothing that would have prevented a dub of these two episodes from being possible, so I am a little disappointed at the lack of one. As far as music and Japanese tracks go, however, the OVA's held up with the original because... clip show.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFUNimation's Eizou Hakusho DVD release is a real treat for fans of the show and I absolutely cannot recommend it enough, as there's some real gold on there, including character afterstories, new versions of the English songs, and plenty of content the sort of which we almost never get to see released outside of Japan. Judging this OVA and it alone, however, it simply doesn't have much to offer.\r\n\r\nDiehard fans of the show like myself might find the 60-second introduction fun, but even those whose experience lies in the Japanese version are likely to be nodding off during the rest of the episodes. It's an abridged rehash, pure and simple, so only go for this one if you feel like getting a feel for a few of the fights from the Japanese version of the show again without watching the episodes themselves."}, {"id": 255, "score": 60, "body": "The first two Eizou Hakusho OVA episodes were a clip show series recapping and summarizing some of the key fights in the Dark Tournament arc of Yu Yu Hakusho. These four OVA episodes are... a bit more interesting. Each of these episodes is themed around one of the four main characters: Yusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, and Hiei; and each episode is composed of a series of music videos sung by the characters themselves, sometimes in groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n __Writing:__ That said, there's not really much to say story-wise here. There's not a whole of continuity you can pull from a series of music videos... it's more about developing characters which were already fairly well-developed in the original series a little bit further. And these episodes do accomplish that. If you haven't seen the series, you won't likely be able to figure out what it's about from these episodes alone, but you might get a gist of the characters and their unique personalities.\r\n\r\n __Art:__ In terms of artwork, these OVA's do go a little farther than the main series did. Mind, the general style of the artwork of the animation is the same as that in the original series, which has become a little bit dated... but most music videos are stylized by nature, and these are no exception. The artists had plenty of fun playing with camera angles and dynamic effects to match the songs better, and the end result is pretty nice. There are even a few videos where the art style changes almost completely, such as Kuwabara's opening song (which is about the sweetest thing ever), and that does enhance the feel of the shorts.\r\n\r\n __Sound:__ Now, this is the most important thing about the OVA's... I mentioned it in my first Eizou Hakusho review, and just from hearing what the series is about, you may have guessed that there is no dub here. As fun as it would be to hear Justin Cook and Chris Sabat attempt a duet, that's aiming a little high, and I can understand why it wasn't worth the cost, so this series is Japanese-only. Even so, it's fun to hear the Japanese voice actors all singing in character, and there's no shortage of songs--at least four for each character, and many of them cross over (Yusuke and Kuwabara have a duet, Kurama and Hiei have multiple, and there's at least one song involving the entire cast), so any diehard fans of the Japanese dub are liable to orgasm while the rest of us still have a pretty good time jivin' to the shorts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile drama CD's and seiyuu singing in-character isn't that uncommon on the islands, we don't often see that kind of material released in the West, so it's a treat to have it readily available... and to have fully-animated videos for each number is pretty awesome, too. You won't find a whole lot of series which have gone so far to please their fanbase as Yu Yu Hakusho has demonstrated, and for that, I applaud this OVA series.\r\n\r\nDefinitely a must-see for anyone who enjoys the Japanese version and still a fun, worthwhile watch for those who are more familiar with the English."}, {"id": 258, "score": 50, "body": "You've seen it. I've seen it. Grandma Mildred has probably seen an episode or two. It's Dragon Ball Z, of course!\r\n\r\n(The Z, by the way, stands for nothing whatsoever--it's just there because it looks cool.)\r\n\r\nDragon Ball Z is a series that everyone knows and most members of this site look back on fondly as the cornerstone of their childhood (or teenagerhood, or mid-20's-hood). This makes it a difficult series to offer an objective critical analysis for--but as some of you may know, I don't own a pair of nostalgia goggles, so this review isn't going to be sugarcoating anything. If you still have any kind of positive relationship with your inner child, leave now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n __Writing:__ Let's face it. Dragon Ball Z isn't about the story. As long as there was some new bad guy for Goku to fight, all was well with the world. And while they weren't nearly as bad as they were in the original Dragon Ball, the series still has more plot holes than you can shake a Power Pole at. Like many marketable shows both then and now, more focus is placed on the characters than the events they're involved in--and boy oh boy, Dragon Ball Z has plenty of characters. From Appule to Zarbon, just about every archetype imaginable is covered, and while characters aren't devoid of depth, most of them are simple enough for viewers to find something to identify with in all of them. Oh, and let's not forget filler. I don't really mind it the first few times I watch a series, but the sheer volume of it in the first season makes it difficult to start re-watching this show from the beginning.\r\n\r\n __Art:__ As old as this series is by now, the artwork is, of course, a little dated. But that's not really an issue for me. Graphics, animation... DBZ is pretty average for its time all across the board. As would be expected, the artwork is more refined than the original Dragon Ball, but not as much so as GT.\r\n\r\n __Sound:__ Dragon Ball Z may well have more English dubs than any other anime in existence. The current one, however, and the one most are likely familiar with, is the FUNimation dub, which, while not the most faithful adaptation in the world, was a lot moreso than others from the period and still effectively maintained the spirit of the show. Free fun fact: Dragon Ball Z was the show which launched FUNimation as a licensing company. As for the Japanese dub... well, Goku sounds like a Japanese schoolgirl, and that was enough to turn me away from it. But it is, of course, more faithful, so the choice is yours.\r\n\r\nDragon Ball Z is a series which I really feel never hit its mark musically. There are actually two complete scores for the series--the original Japanese score, which included tracks from the original Dragon Ball and used the same style of music and orchestration therefrom, and the heavy, \"action-y\" score by Bruce Faulconer for the early English adaptations of the show. The former is suited to the more laid-back scenes of the show, but I feel often falls short when the action inevitably begins, whereas the Faulconer score has the opposite problem: It just sounds silly hearing those heavy action sounds while someone frolics through a meadow. What really struck home were the soundtracks to many of the DBZ fighting games (the Budokai series, specifically), which had a unique combination of both these styles which I would have loved to hear in the show itself--but, oh well. One can dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBottom line, is Dragon Ball Z a good series? ...not really. Is it still fun and enjoyable? Sure. Hell, I must have seen the whole thing at least five times by now. Despite the glaring plotholes, mostly-static characters, and relatively linear plotline, it manages to maintain interest throughout, and while action for the sake of it isn't worth much, it pulls it off reasonably well. If you're one of the handful of people who has not seen this series, I would recommend it solely because an anime fan who has no experience with Dragon Ball Z is practically unheard of."}, {"id": 265, "score": 50, "body": "Naruto is a series with millions of fans the world over and a truly unforgettable cast of characters. But so is Jersey Shore.\r\n\r\nThis series is one of many which are popular mostly due to their wide variety of characters and \"cool fight scenes,\" but unfortunately, Naruto has very little to offer on the quality writing front. Please note that, at the time of my writing this, I have not yet seen a single episode of the sequel series, Shippuden--and for the best, because this is a review solely of the original 220-episode anime, just as Shippuden's review will be one on its merits and its alone. No room for bias here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n __Writing:__ I will credit Naruto--at the very least, it was free of the many glaring plotholes present in Dragon Ball, another series popular for similar reasons. And the military/political aspects of the show, while certainly not Code Geass or (further yet) Ghost in the Shell deep, are relatively sound and significant to the plot. Where the series really falls flat on its face is in its lack of consistency. A well-planned, well-written series sets laws for itself and then follows them, thus creating a believable world for the viewer--by contrast, the physics of the world of Naruto, much like Superman's powers, depend mostly on what's convenient for the situation, and are usually given a half-hearted explanation some time later. This \"do something cool and then scramble for some kind of explanation\" style of writing is sorely detrimental to the experience of the show and makes it blatantly clear where the creator's priorities lie: It's all about flashy fight scenes, and the plot's just there to fill the gaps between them. Michael Bay fans rejoice.\r\n\r\n __Art:__ The artwork and animation are fairly typical for the era. There's no great amount of detail in the lines or fill, and the animation, while not choppy, is no more fluid than other similarly-produced anime series. All in all it's another par for the course, visually.\r\n\r\n __Sound:__ I've seen the show both dubbed and subbed, and the quality is pretty interchangeable. Naruto's voice is just as grating and obnoxious in both cases, and the rest of the cast is neither greatly- nor poorly-performed. Despite many long outdated beliefs, the dub is also uncut. The soundtrack is actually one of the series's stronger points, though--the mix of rock with traditional Japanese instrumentation works well as the calling card musical style of this series, and is both recognizable and reasonably well-composed. I must give credit for that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUltimately, Naruto falls into the same trap that so many other series--shonen especially--fall victim to: A very distinct prioritization of action over story content. If you're just looking for some cool fight scenes between characters with cool powers, shows like Bleach and Naruto will more than satisfy the need. If you're looking for a more intricate plot in an immersive setting with dynamic characters, you probably won't find much fulfillment in Naruto."}, {"id": 329, "score": 50, "body": "Overall - 5\r\n\r\nThe only word that comes to mind is - disappointing. This anime was one of the most awaited shows to come on, but it was a bummer and a waste of time. I got a recommendation for this show from almost all of my friends. The only reason I gave it a 5 is because of the animation and audio, otherwise a 3 would have worked. Heavyweight corporations made this, but for all that, it lacks the only thing which actually matters - the story. Not that there aren't good shows who lack a story, but this one tries so hard to create one and yet it fails, its very predictable and downright annoying at times. The main character could have used some height, and female lead -being the idol of the school- could have picked a better person to like. No, seriously, that guy looks like he just cleared grade school. In the end, the show is crap. Seriously, it doesn't even deserve the 24 episodes, the show is too damn stretched and the only thing people tend to do is talk about useless things, talk about some more useless things and then some.\r\n\r\nAnimation - 9.5/10\r\n\r\nThe animation is very well done to be frank. The Kuroyukihime (?) (also, what sort of retard puts 'hime (princess)' in his daughter's name?) is done with amazing detail and the fights are done with great fluidity. The male could have had been higher though, but then again, that's the plot's problem, not the animation's.\r\n\r\nAudio - 9/10\r\n\r\nThe OP and ED are done brilliantly and the voices in the anime are fine.\r\n\r\nPlot - 2/10\r\n\r\nThe plot is, for the lack of better words, absolute shit. Its as predictable as sunrise. No, seriously. The show seems to shout - \"Stuck in some terrible shit with balls against the walls? Why just glow like a bloody fairy and use the awesomemegamonsterkilling cannon you get from it.\" or \"hey you know how if you say 'i care' or some other emo bullshit you can get your hand on the aforementioned cannon and win?\" The shows's plot is a bloody wreck, and to top it off, it dumps all the unanswered questions onto the head of the second season. Not cool, people.\r\n\r\nRealism - 3/10\r\n\r\nWhy will a school idol go out with a terrible weaboo such as the protagonist? Why, she was using him for his skill at games, that's understandable, but why go out? He is everything you shouldn't be, short, fat, shy, good at games, lacking any social skills whatsoever, being a loner, to name a few.

The similarity is so uncanny, in fact, that I find myself questioning the fact that she didn't. But, as far as official sources are concerned, she was not involved. So, there you go.\r\n\r\nF3 stands out in the world of hentai as being one of the very few comedy hentai series... and if you like old, wacky relationship shows like Urusei Yatsura and Ranma \u00c2\u00bd, it will likely leave you satisfied. Being a 3-episode hentai series, of course, it doesn't hold up to the same standards as such serial anime as those, but the production staff did a pretty good job with it given what they were working with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n __Writing:__ The series is, for the most part, pretty episodic. The setting is established with the main (female) character's problem of being unable to climax, which, while not the most creative thing in the world, I will say is original in that I have yet to see any other hentai series follow the same formula. The first episode focuses on this problem as she and her friends try various wacky quick-fixes by means of hypnosis, fortune-telling, and mad science; the other two episodes just kind of roll into their own storylines, having little to do with the first. But, the style remains consistent, and there is a definite continuity present, so while there's not really a story in the sense of there being development or closure, each episode tells its own story and is interesting enough to watch.\r\n\r\n __Art:__ The visuals aren't bad for a hentai. The production values won't blow you away, but everything is drawn reasonably well, and there's consistency in the artwork. Eyes don't float above hair (easy tell for an anime with low production values), and no one has breasts blown up to the point of being bigger than her head. One thing of note is that this series isn't too extreme, and in fact avoids showing genitalia at all on many occasions, so if you're looking for something more explicit, best not to put your eggs in this basket.\r\n\r\n __Sound:__ The dub is one of the better ones among hentai series, but that's not saying much at all--it's still pretty bad. I had no problems with the Japanese dub, myself, but the main character's voice may be a little whiny for some, so be warned. The music is nothing to buy a CD soundtrack for, either, but it fits the series well enough, and does a reasonably good job making the viewer's experience a pleasant one--overall, very average in the sound department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReally, what I can say about this series above all else is that it's unique. There are very few hentai comedy series out there (assuming you don't count shows like Ranma \u00c2\u00bd and Girls Bravo as hentai, which I think most of us don't), and none that capture the \"wacky hijinx\" spirit of cheesy 80's anime comedies as well as F3 does.

Keep in mind that it's still a member of the Night Shift Nurses family, so exercise caution. This third installment (or fourth, if you count Kranke) differs from its predecessor in that no characters from prior entries make reappearances--this epoch takes place at a different time and place, with its own characters and world. What sets this apart from the other entries in the franchise, to me, is that this series has a much better sense of humor than the other, more deadpan-serious ones have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n __Writing:__ Night Shift Nurses 2 was unrealistic in that the characters didn't act or react in the way that real people would, something which 3 thankfully avoids... however, 3 is still unrealistic in its own right. How's that? Well, it gets into X-Men mutation/gene manipulation territory. This definitely hurts the show when compared to the very well-written and relatively believable first entry in the series, but doesn't kill it completely. The series does have some continuity and a reasonable plot (revolving around an uncharacteristically attractive homeless man who signs on to become a human guinea pig in exchange for a lump sum), and they stick with it well enough. The only real pity is that it lacks any real resolution, and just kind of fizzles out in the end.\r\n\r\n __Art__ and  __Sound__ haven't improved or suffered since the previous installment. Neither could be called fantastic, but they suit the series well enough. Pretty standard production values across the board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, the strongest point and saving grace for this series is its sense of humor. That's what really makes it stand out in the Night Shift Nurses series, which isn't known for being... comically inclined. 3 actually has a nice, rather sophisticated sense of humor, though, the likes of which you might see in Satoshi Kon's works like Paranoia Agent or Tokyo Godfathers. It even has a few funny instances that weren't even attempts at humor--for example, the ONLY really hardcore scene in this series is when a character pops in a video of the first Night Shift Nurses series. Meta.\r\n\r\nNight Shift Nurses 3 maintains the relatively high production values (at least compared to other hentai) that the franchise as a whole has set, which is good for anyone who doesn't care about story, setting, or any other qualitative aspects in a hentai. For those of us who do, though, 3 still isn't such a bad choice.

BTOOOM! is just another one of those (poorly named) animes  that are cashing in on the \"stuck in a game\"  genre that has been increasing in popularity almost exponentially. BTOOOM! happens to follow the life of people who get abducted and thrown in a real world game that is very similar to the viral online game appropriately named BTOOOM! and now they have to blow each other to kingdom come to survive. A  _very_ original premise, and almost as original a story. That was sarcasm, by the way. \r\n\r\nThat said, I overused the word BTOOOM! in the above paragraph just to drive home the point that it really is terribly named.\r\n\r\nNow, to give it a proper grading. I will rate it based on five aspects, all of 20 grades each, to reach a total out of 100. \r\n\r\nArtwork and Animation - 17/20\r\nThe artwork is good, its a rather dull dark world, and the artwork is able pull it off without looking stupid. The emotions are also rather well done and the artwork is generally convincing. The animation is also fair enough. There is the occasional out of place movement, but nothing too damaging.\r\nSound and music - 14/20\r\nNot much to discuss here, the sounds are fairly consistent, but they are unable to keep up the \"tropical jungle\" theme for too long. Other than that, music is fairly okay. Even though I never got into it, a lot of people might.\r\n\r\nPlot - 8/20\r\nThe plot of BTOOOM! is by far the biggest chink in its armor. even with a semi-decent plot BTOOOM! could have been grouped with the \"average\" crowd, but it just had to get blown off the ridge. The plot is unoriginal, uninspired and it isn't very clever. \r\n\r\nThe lack of originality is rampant throughout the anime, its your everyday generic survival story, even Hollywood has more original ideas. Its the same old 20-something NEET who is very good at games and gets drawn into a game. \r\nThe inspiration is clearly lacking on every front, it is FULL of plot holes and the action sequences are very illogical. The protagonist, who is clearly a shut-in betafag, is somehow able to throw bombs very accurately and run and dodge like a dude running from child support. He is also somehow resistant to the usually fatal bomb-exploded-in-face. And all this based on what? His skill at games? Why, that's bullshit right there.\r\n\r\nBTOOOM! is also not very clever the few times it plans on coming up with a plot device (for example, lack of food). Anyone who has ever touched a game that is played by more than one player knows how to create killzones, how to fuck with people's radars and throw up false clues. Even the retarded COD fanboy knows that if the game shouts \"THE BOMB HAS BEEN PLANTED\" on everyone's screen, every other guy in the lobby is gonna descend on the point like bats out of hell, no exception. But for some reason, the protagonist (who happens to be world #10 and best in japan) is shocked when he sees a killzone created by the only source of food.\r\n\r\nThere are obviously other plot holes, like Sakamoto's uncanny ability to teleport behind his enemies, or Himiko's ability to always have something appropriate in her pocket or Taira's lack of understanding of medicine (what's the thing you do after almost getting your leg bitten off by an animal? Why - you don't wrap it and you just \"walk it off\" by walking in a potentially disease filled river because \"you don't have time\")\r\n\r\nCharacters - 17/20\r\nThe characters are the redeeming quality of BTOOOM! they are probably the only thing done right. The characters are surprisingly deep and they have emotional conflicts. I actually went so far as to feel bad for Himiko and Sakamoro's mom (Sakamoto is an asshole by the way). Even so, a lot of characters with potential are un-developed/undeveloped. The effects of being on the island are  pronounced, with almost everyone becoming a sociapath, and creepy encounters leaving quite the mark on people. The development of characters isn't all that good, the essence of the people never really changes even at the end, but its still something.\r\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/20\r\nBTOOOM! is enjoyable if you are into the genre, but try to watch something else if you aren't. its action is somewhat decent and it sometimes does land a actually decent plot device, sadly these are ruined by a very easily predictable plot, the enjoyment is definitely there, just a bit hard to find.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, my review has been overly critical of the series, but it isn't as bad as I made it sound, it does have some genuinely good scenes. Sadly, it wasted the potential to turn them into something good. \r\n\r\nAdding up, we get 18+10+8+13+14 = 66/100"}, {"id": 413, "score": 60, "body": "Dragon Ball GT combines the wacky adventure aspects that drew people to classic Dragon Ball with the crazy fight scenes characteristic to Dragon Ball Z, making it my personal favorite entry in the series.

Everything is much more sharply defined, more visual effects are employed, and everything looks like it came from the digital era as opposed to the previous two series' rather 90's animation style. When I had heard that they were re-drawing the frames of animation for Kai, I was so sure they were going to bring this shiny new art style to Z. Imagine my disappointment.\r\n\r\n __Sound:__ As with Z, there are two soundtracks to this series--the original Japanese, which employs the same goofy Dragon Ball style of music across all three series, and the American soundtrack, which most Toonami viewers are probably familiar with. The latter does tend to suit the action scenes better whereas the former is better suited to the intermediary scenes. Easily the most infamous piece of audio from GT is the English opening sequence, which I do hate with a passion, but has thankfully been replaced on commercial releases. The original opening and closing are pretty darn catchy, and the voice-over work holds up to the same standards as Dragon Ball Z did. Not spectacular in either language, but certainly not bad. And it finally suits Goku to sound like a 10-year-old in Japanese.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll in all, I thoroughly enjoyed GT, at least relative to the other entries in the series. Most are inclined to disagree. It can be hard to determine whether an existing fan of the franchise will enjoy this series or not without watching it, so dive in with an open mind and see what happens."}, {"id": 464, "score": 66, "body": "Oda Nobunaga was genuinely the only harem anime in the past four years that I honestly enjoyed. Now, perhaps enjoyed isn't quite right, maybe amused will be closer. It was amusing the see the brain dead plot and fetish-fulfilling characters actually achieve something. My amusement was a direct product of Oda Nobunaga no Yabou being set in feudal japan (in the warring states period/ Senguku era). If you have no idea who Nobunaga was or what the Senguku era is, you will probably not like Oda Nobunaga no Yabou for the sole reason that you won't be able to connect with it or even understand what's going on. Still, if you want a summary of what happened IRL, its like this - Nobunaga was this really chill guy in the Oda clan, and since he was born during the Warring states period, every clan was at war with one clan or the other clan(duh) and the Ashikaga Shogunate was weakened. He got up and did a lot of cool shit, took down the shogun and almost unified Japan under a single banner. He was forced to commit suicide before that happened though. Anyways, the peace he created lasted almost 300 years until the Meiji restoration in 1868 when the Emperor and the Shogun jumped at each other over foreign interests (mostly the U.S.). \n\n img(http://i.imgur.com/OfP9ad5.jpg)\n\nOda Nobunaga tries to do all the above (in a lot more detail and being much more specific though) while remaining a harem/ecchi/comedy. But if you want my advice, walk away if you know nothing about Japanese history or don't even know the map of Japan by heart or are just plain old uninterested in either. Well, unless you are willing to watch Oda Nobunaga only for the fanservice, in which case, I wish you best of luck.\n\n Artwork and Animation (8/10) - \nAfter all, what is an ecchi anime without artwork? The story isn't gonna do shit, atleast the artwork is a surefire thing. \n\n __ Character Models __ - The characters models are fair enough.There is nothing  _ wrong _  with them but nothing out of the ordinary either. Eyes are a bit dull, but eh, you get used to it.\n\n img(http://i.imgur.com/V56AwjY.jpg)\n\n __ Environment __ - Quite good, especially the background soldiers and stuff. Its almost breathtaking to see the huge armies carrying their banners clashing, or the massive ships sailing off into the sunset (even though that is historically incorrect). Despite that, the detail drop across the environment is pretty steep, so you won't see sprawling cities, ever. Well, no loss, most of the series happens on mountains/forests or inside a hut and those don't suffer the same problems.\n\n img(http://i.imgur.com/S0QALjL.jpg)\n\n __Animation__ - Probably one of the strongest -and the most unused- part of the entire series. Right into the first episode, you will be awed by the fluid animation during the battles. But it was still disappointing. In the sense that it could have been used much, much more frequently. Considering how we are talking about the warring states, battles oughta be fairly common, right? Wrong. Despite its solid artwork and animation, it just isn't used in that sense. There were, what? five short battles in total? It was almost like the artwork was itching for a fight and the script told it to fuck off.\n\n __ Fan service __ - Well, no nudity for you. There still some mediocre amount of fan service in the form of Nobuna always showing her breasts and Katsui's breastplate jumping around. The ED had a pretty ecchi video too.\n\n Sound and Music (6/10)-\nGonna keep this section short. \n\n __Voice acting__ - The VAs were meh and I didn't particularly care for them. Most of the \"heavy\" conversation doesn't quite stimulate the viewer to the point it was expected, but its not something disappointing either.\n\n __Environment__ - By environment, I refer to stuff like town chatter, or the sound of a brook. While the chatter of other people was faint at best, the other sections (like the chirping of birds or footsteps) were pretty good. The war drums  were also quite nice.\n\n __Music__ - Eh. Like, really eh. Despite having a great OP  _video_ the music accompanying it was quite shit. Same for the ED (except the ED had a shit video too). The BGMs were more....promising. Most of the times, the BGMs came up only when the tide of the battle changed  (for better or for worse), and I really loved that. It gave a cinematic feeling to the entire thing.\n\n Storyline (25/30)-\nThere are two sides to war. One is strategy and the other is tactics. Strategy is about planning, diplomacy, economics, maintenance, supply and stuff like that. Tactics is more of a in-your-face affair. Its about (but not limited to) how to defeat the guy in front of you using outmaneuvers. Think of it like strategy, except on a much shorter time scale and with a much more specific objective. Oda Nobunaga is about strategy. It does have some tactics (read: battle) but its kinda secondary.\n\n img(http://i.imgur.com/v6wEmfc.jpg)\n\n __Premise__ - The premise relies around Yoshiharu who is a student and suddenly ends up in the Sengoku era for reasons unknown (and never revealed). He happens to be a big fan of the game \"Nobunaga's Ambition\" and therefore knows the ins and outs of the history of the era. At the same time, all the daimyos (read: feudal lords) just happen to be cute girls.\nNow will he able to take the place of Kinoshita Tokichiro and unify Japan under Nobunaga?\n\n\n __Execution__ - Considering how pointless the premise sounds, my expectations were fairly low. Still, the story goes around Nobuna (Nobunaga's female version) trying to conquer japan on her own as the fortune teller MC guides her hand. He meets other important people (who are mostly girls too, for some reason) who played a great role in Nobunaga's conquests and downfall IRL. As I mentioned earlier, the focus is on strategy, so Nobuna is basically treading on a fine line where she can be overwhelmed by other clans if she makes one wrong move. Most clans don't support the rise of the Oda clan and will stop at nothing to kill Nobuna. This allows for great pressure on the diplomatic side of things, allowing for a more enjoyable outlook on the entire matter. The series all but explains to you the predicaments of being a daimyo during the Sengoku period. It still isn't KSnH levels of bullshitting and is sometimes fairly funny, which I guess is a good thing. I would go so far as to call its buildup to episode 8 great but it kinda started dropping off after that. I mean, there were boring emo parts here and there, but overall it was fairly fast paced. I just kinda wished that the battles were more...active. \n\nTo quote Sun Tzu (albeit out of context)- 'Strategy without tactics is the slowest path to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat\"\nI know I'm taking it completely out of context here, but Oda Nobunaga also took the slowest path to victory. With a few great battles, it could have been a much, much better series. See, the problem is that the tactics totally got killed. The fights are literally just one man armies killing each other's cannon fodder. Most of the focus was on the support crew. I would have preferred it if it showed how the common man fights, because there is nothing more beautiful about battle than a guy fighting to the last breath -torn banner and all- in the service of his lord. Like, seriously. This was one part that was seriously downplayed since the OP support and Main cast go berserk on Soldier C's ass and then he dies without so much as a second look. Archers fire at the valiant defenders who hold against the barrage with their battlements falling apart and without a shield, and we get to look at MC talk bullshit for five minutes straight. I mean, give those brave people some screen time, you fuckfaces.\n\nAlso, real battles are much more coordinated than blobs of soldiers hitting each other at random intervals.\n\n img(http://i.imgur.com/xUx1YCr.jpg)\n\nI also hated how most of the cast went into battle without armor. Nagahide literally fights with only a Nagitana and katsuie doesn't wear a helmet and leads the charges at the same time. Even a complete retard knows that the general is the most important man (or woman) on the battlefield, and a dead or dismounted general is usually a routed army, Katsui somehow doesn't comprehend that stray arrows exist. Toshiie Maeda  also doesn't wear any armor despite using a yari (which leaves too many opening between thrusts). Other than that, the fights are too simple minded and don't quite comprehend logistics. Perhaps you will realize why during the Imagawa arc.\n\n img(http://i.imgur.com/V8UvAg6.jpg)\n\nOther than that, the main diplomacy can't really be argued against, since it happened irl. I did find that some diplomacy was oversimplified to fit the (already narrow) viewer base, which was a bit sad.\n\nAs a side note, the romance is, for the most part, about nobuna being a tsundere and saying emo stuff while crying. Not cool.\n\n Characters (12/30)\n\n img(http://i.imgur.com/8KIS944.jpg)\nAs I mentioned earlier, the characters are made for the purpose of fetish fulfillment. Toshiie is your strong calm loli, Goemon is your loli with the voice impediment Nene is the cute imouto type loli, Katsui is the dependable strong girl and Nagahide is the \"clever\" woman and Mitsuhide is the token tsundere who hates losing. Yeah, pretty damn cliche.\n\nAnd of course, there are the villains, who don't really have any clear motives to speak of, but want Nobuna stopped anyways. They all assemble in a dark room and be REALLY condescending while saying non-descript things like \"so it has begun\". Because that's what villains do.\n\nOther than that, the characters have no development or goals to speak of with no backstory (even for the MC) and none of them are anywhere near what they were in real life. Despite that, I still kinda liked the people that did not turn into cute girls, the Viper was pretty cool, and so was hanzou. \n\n Enjoyment (15/20)\nDespite me finding Oda nobunaga interesting, most people will perhaps not share the sentiment. Mostly because of a difference of interest. Still, its decent enough and even teaches you a little on the fly, so it really isn't all that bad. Despite my rating making it end up in the 60's its decent enough to be a 70~ anime. Tch, if only its characters were good enough. While I won't recommend it to anyone but desperate history fans, its really not all that bad even if you go in blind. Besides, Japanese history is fun, and learning while watching anime can't possibly be all that bad.\nOr can it?\n\n img(http://i.imgur.com/tvjpMGZ.jpg)"}, {"id": 488, "score": 68, "body": "Red Data Girl (RDG) is a rather disappointing series from PA works (in comparison to its other works anyways). Still, to me it was a breath of fresh air from all the generic tried-and-tested series of shows that air for the most part of anime today. It has a rather unique storyline while still having a more \"vanilla\" feel to it.. Of course, in terms of anime, pantsu will probably be considered vanilla, but I mean that it doesn't pander. To pretty much anything. No fanservice, no cliche character archetypes, no asspulls, no fetish fullfillment and so on.\n\nReview contains minor spoilers. probably more minor than whatever the description said anyways.\n img(http://i.imgur.com/66E2eLx.jpg)\n\nThat said, while RDG is very careful not to make any faults, it doesn't really have a lot going for it in the story department. While the story is rather well crafted, it just doesn't have any content in it, its almost....empty. But I'll get to that in a while. \n\nI do feel I should mention why the series is named Red Data Girl. The name comes from the Red List published by IUCN which lists all the endangered animals. Apparently Izumiko is a rather rare girl. Yeah, that's it.\n\n Artwork (9/10) \n\nPA works seldom disappoints in this field, and it sure as hell is true for RDG. The artwork is nothing short of beautiful with great amount of detail to the characters and extremely well crafted faces. The environment is nothing to laugh at either, its expansive, lush and heavily detailed even at long distances. To the point that I thought that it was ridiculous. Every single cliff that will never show up again has its own unique texture, no quality drop over distance whatsoever and even the crowd has well drawn-out and heavily detailed non-clone characters. The special effects are also over-the-top levels of good and magic and stuff resonate with energy. What more, it even handles any boost to the saturation with ease. I got upto 200% and even then the colors didn't get messed up.\n\n img(http://i.imgur.com/k2cWsa1.jpg)\n\nI don't think I can honestly ask for any more, It puts most other anime artworks to shame. Almost perfect.\n\nOnly shortcoming I can think of is Masumi's face at times is unable to relay happiness and it ends up giving him a weird look. Even then, its an isolated example. Rest of the series is nothing short of stellar in this field.\n img(http://i.imgur.com/tfevm4t.jpg)\n\n Music (8/10)\n\nWell, PA works did the sound, so you know the drill. No point in a large music section.\n\nAs of the music, for the most part, the music is quiet. It fits perfectly with the entire theme. The OP is pretty good with a great AMV to accompany it, but the ED in itself is kinda average. But the outstanding BGMs that accompany it are quite something.\n\nyoutube(DBYkLY0lyl8)\n\n Story (15/30)\nThe story of Red Data Girl revolves around Izumiko being a vessel of a (the?) goddess. The rest is in the description above. While the story in itself seems nothing special, it is made to be one. Everything is shrouded in mystery. While it may seem comprehensible at first, it quickly drifts to KsNH levels of complex. Nothing at all is explained. It throws a bunch of words around and you just gotta ride with them. This is made even worse by the characters being realistic. Usually, in an anime, X asks Y a remotely personal question and Y responds with all his history and then explains every word he uses. This usually looks stupid and unnatural, so RDG gets rid of it. Leading to no explanation at all for the interactions between characters. Hell, you even gotta guess who the person being talked to is, and what their relationship with the talkie is. While that may seem overly stupid on RDG's part, its actually quite the tactic to hold people's attention. It allows for a rather good buildup and it strokes the curiosity of the viewer - to push him until that next episode where he finally understands what happened, with things becoming cleared and clearer until....they stop doing that. \n\n img(http://i.imgur.com/zRDgNQ1.jpg)\n\nThat may seem like a very good plan, but it has one fatal flaw - it requires that the doubts it creates gets cleared up. That, sadly, never really happens. It just makes things even more complex. This in turn causes one of the most major problems for RDG - an unsatisfying ending. A really, really terrible ending. One that clears up exactly nothing. Half the things mentioned in the first three episodes are never heard from again, and those that are heard from, are just mumbled here and there. The end is extremely rushed too, like as if they fit in 26 eps worth of stuff into 12.\n\nRDG's plot is reliant on an arc based structure with an overhanging plot. Now, that is usually not a problem, but RDG deviates too much from its original concept. It really stops being about the goddess and more about what Mayura does and some sort of a competition which achieves....something. None of these even have a little to do with the original plot, so it seemed like a weird direction to take the entire series in. Some of it is rather interesting, but other than the occasional \"visits\" by the goddess, there was honestly nothing else to it. See, that is why I said that the entire story was empty earlier on. To me atleast, the original concept was new and good. I liked Mayura a little, but after a while, she just came off as greedy and bitchy. Why the Souda twins were given so much importance was beyond me, they served little to no purpose to the main storyline.\n\nAnd to be honest, melodramatic fights between the family or rivals in school is just a lot more dull than a goddess descending and making shit happen. Her appearances are usually pretty awesome too. Sadly, these appearances are few and far between. But when she does appear, its brilliant.\n\n img(http://i.imgur.com/GYzhCtD.jpg)\n\nOn the other hand, one great thing about it is the immersion in the story. Now, I'm not sure whether it was caused by the downright brilliant artwork or the soothing BGMs or the traditional Japanese atmosphere, but whatever the case may be, it sure as hell got me immersed to the point where I marathon'd it.\n\nSo, to summarize, RDG doesn't make the classic faults, becomes really unique and falls flat on its face.\n\n  Characters - (23/30) \n\n img(http://i.imgur.com/lQlJySr.jpg)\n\nIt starts off being totally focused on Izumiko, but as soon as the first three eps are over, it switches over to focus on Mayura. After that, the first arc is totally disconnected from everything as the triplets take the spotlight and almost become the main characters. The entire story starts moving around them. This keeps up until episode 9. It talks about their life, their families, their goals and even their pets. On the other hand, none of these are ever made clear for the so called \"main characters\", who are resigned to the background despite being protagonists.\n\nStill, atleast the the characters don't follow any certain archetypes to speak of, so I was really surprised when Miyuki turned out to be an incompetent failure. Considering how good he looks and how this is a shoujo anime, I expected him to charm the ladies around him with his broken japanese english and then hit bulls-eye with his bow. In reality he gets beaten up by a bunch of students and his arrows miss their marks. Well, that was new.\n\nThe development for some of the characters was actually fairly decent, and this was pretty clear in case of Izumiko since she actively tries to change herself and succeeds. Miyuki doesn't have such a development, but its still there, its mostly passive, but its still there. Other than that, the support crew gets varying development depending on the person. The triplets get lots, but other than those, no one else really even comes close. The villain and his \"army\" is never really explained and nor are his motives or reasons. Same applies for a lot of other characters (Murakami, Honoka, etc) which makes the entire series a bit flat because the motives of characters are never really clear. \n\n img(http://i.imgur.com/OFaSP68.jpg)\n\nDespite all that, the characters were pretty likable and the main cast had some great development to go with it. The far-support could have been better though.\n\n Enjoyment (14/20)\n\nFor me, if I can finish a series, it was enjoyable. To that end, RDG did a great job in holding my interest, and even though I was conscious of its faults at the time, I chose to overlook them to enjoy what I had. To be honest, I even had some respect for it for trying to break free of the usual route.Despite that, I just can't help but shake my head at the plot though. There was nothing in it, and I was still interested. I can't really say that it had \"decent romance\" or \"decent adventure\" or even \"decent fantasy\", but at the same time, I enjoyed it nonetheless. Perhaps its a series for me that I enjoyed solely because I might as well do that over calling it shit and picking at its faults. No matter the objectivity, I can quite confidently say I had fun with it. In hindsight though, its a pretty ugly sight.\n\n img(http://i.imgur.com/PXxGhBD.jpg)"}, {"id": 492, "score": 51, "body": "Akuma no riddle is an anime I really don't understand. It was marketed (and hyped) as a dark-action Yuri anime, but what it delivered was disney-esque action with a touch of friendship is magic. The story is based in a certain Myoujou Academy, where the black class is actually just a bunch of assassins trying to take out their hit (Haru). However though, one of the assassins (Tokakau) decides that she likes Haru and will protect her against all these terrors.\n\n img(http://i.imgur.com/tbGNYqq.jpg)\n\n Story (13/30)\n\nNow, while the premise is rather interesting -being a death game and all- it imposes specific rules to this game. The winner of the game supposedly gets one of their wishes granted, but they must first give Haru an advance notice before they try to take her out. Since only one wish is fulfilled, it discourages the assassins from working together and forces them to give away their element of surprise. \n\nand from then on out, AnR fell to the ground.\n\nSince the assassins were attacking in installments, it rapidly became obvious that Tokaku is gonna take them all out - after all, that is the only way for the plot to progress. This is often referred to as a \"Monster of the Week setup\". If you are unfamiliar with the terminology, a monster of the week setup has a strong monster appearing and posing a threat to the main character on a weekly (in this case, episodic) basis. Kind of like how pokemon did it. This forces the storyline down a very predictable path, with tokaku clearing assassins one after the other. If that wasn't bad enough, the assassins make such half-assed attempts at Haru's life that it is almost pitiable - and they do hype their master plans in advance.\n\n ~!This is probably best explained by Haruki's tactic. Before she attacked, she asked Nio if her wish will still be granted if she died and took Haru with her. This suggested something like blowing up half the school in an attempt to kill Haru so that her wish will finally be fulfilled. What really happened was that she made the theater lights fall on Haru- so SCARY. Even then, her master plan was executed perfectly, Tokaku was taken off-guard and the lights hit her the best they could. But what was the result of this perfectly executed plan? Tokaku just shrugged it off and stood up, and Haruki was knocked unconscious. What a lethal plan, retard.!~\n\nAfter all is said and done, the story ends being pretty wishy washy and forcing happiness through plot armor alone. Oh, X didn't die from whatever would kill her cause company Y had inserted Z in her body!\nSomething like that. \n\nThat said, not all is wrong with its story. I found that the buildup and atmosphere was really well created and the immersion was pretty nice. The character development -while being episodic- was still fairly good. Think of it like a football match, one team gets a great buildup, breaks through the opposing side with runs and spot on passing, trick the goalkeeper, and then they fail to score. Repeatedly.\n\n Characters (14/30)\n\n img(http://i.imgur.com/ZPGnS8m.jpg)\n\nFor the most part, the characters were pretty diverse and didn't follow cardboard cut out archetypes. While there were till characters that were fitting certain cliches (rich girl, crazy girl, cute girl with the bear) they mostly outgrew those during their epsiode. \n\nAnd that right there is the fault.\nTheir episode.\n\nCharacters develop only during their turn as the monster of the week, outside of which they just talk about the current monster and comment on non-descript things (like, \"So, its time for THAT, huh?\"). So even though their development is good in their own episodes, it still seems like \"oh, its time to throw some story out for girl #1321\"\n\nSo to describe the development, the word I'd use is probably \"forced\". Despite providing a lot of story and spending a lot of time on the characters, it just isn't able to execute them properly.\n\nThat said, some ends really were great. The Romeo and Juliet one comes to mind. That was perfect. Although, the overall end of the series ruined that too. Anyways, the character I probably liked the best was probably Nio, she was pretty likable from the get go and her twin personalities were the deal clincher. I kinda liked banba too, but the story doesn't really give her the respect or the screen time she deserves.\n\nHowever, considering the large cast of characters and only being given 12 episodes to fit the development in, I think AnR did a decent job.\n\n Artwork (7/10)\nAt the start, the palette was nothing special. It was somewhat gritty and realistic, but it was unable to cover for the plot's failures. Despite that, I liked the artwork at specific times. To be more precise, the art really only strays from \"average\" when it tries to be darker, and when it does get darker, it looks great. There aren't a lot of faults to speak of, but there aren't a lot of extraordinary thing either when its being all bright and sunny. \n\nCharacter models were fine and a bit heavily detailed, but once again, only showed greatness during darker parts.\n\n img(http://i.imgur.com/fX9aiHd.jpg)\n img(http://i.imgur.com/H5WSLYk.jpg)\n\nThe environment was surprisingly detailed, and while I would count that as a plus point, most of the time the environment isn't interactable. \"wait\" you say \"this isn't a game, what the fuck is an interactable environment in this context?\" By interactable, I refer to it being dynamic. Or perhaps showing when something should effect it. It just wasn't there.\n\n ~!Take a look at ep10, to be more specific, the part where Hanabusa (?) throws the chandelier at Tokaku. It hits her face first and drives her into the wall, after which Tokaku tries getting up and you can see that the wall is undamaged and the weapons are precisely where they were before being hit by a chandelier going like 40KMPH.\n\n ~!\n img(http://i.imgur.com/gkJZbyv.jpg)\n img(http://i.imgur.com/93KwFWk.jpg)!~\n\nand right before that scene, Tokaku reaches for a pistol after leaving her cover and exposing herself to fire despite the fact that she had multiple weapons behind her!\n ~!\n img(http://i.imgur.com/oJw0uwe.jpg)\n img(http://i.imgur.com/VjZHYBe.jpg)\n img(http://i.imgur.com/1O2kfDu.jpg)\n!~!~\n\nThat said, I still adored the art style and it looked really good at certain points. I'd say that the overall artwork is good.\n\n Sound (7/10)\nThis was a fairly surprising development. Considering the wide cast of characters, I assumed that the VAs would probably be terrible considering they are only supposed to play anything approaching a normal character for one episode, but I felt that the VAs did a fine job with what they had.\n\n img(http://i.imgur.com/p5liAXQ.jpg)\n\nThe music section is quite...varied. I liked the OP to a certain extent, but the real meat of the music section is the ED. There are character EDs and all of them are unique to the episode and are voiced by the monster of the episode, not to mention - all of them are quite nice.\n\nThat is honestly all there is to talk about in the music section. The rest was pretty standard.\n\n Enjoyment (10/20)\nFor the most part AnR was...disappointing. Once again, I refer to the earlier football analogy. It was annoying how often the series missed its mark. It was like it wasn't even aiming for the goal, but at the audience of cheering fans who just want everything to work out. In that same sense, AnR's finishes were more aimed at the niche audience of 10 year olds who believe that everything in the world is bright and sunny with friendship being the power against all evil. Which is quite different than what it originally wanted to be - a dark gritty tale of lesbian assassins in a fight to the death. I mean, who the hell would NOT watch that? The complete disregard to its marketed genre and its incompetency at providing satisfying endings is probably the most paramount reason for AnR not being quite as enjoyable. But then again, there is some solace to be found in the fact that AnR really does have some good buildup and it isn't  _boring_ at any point. The pacing is fair enough and it manages to shoehorn everything into 12 episodes.\n\nWith that said, I would't really recommend watching Akuma no Riddle to anyone that wants what it seems like. If you want a somewhat darker but happy ending sort of anime, then I guess this is it. Implying of course that such a market even exists, though I'm pretty sure it doesn't.\n\n img(http://i.imgur.com/nnrinRV.jpg)"}, {"id": 507, "score": 54, "body": "No game No life is a rather overrated anime. \n\nNGNL is about Sora and Shiro - two legendary gamers. They go by the name \"Blank\" (represented by a blank space) and unbeatable in any game. The genre doesn't matter, the rules don't matter. As long as the game isn't impossible, blank never loses. Then some mysterious emails happen and they land into a world where everything is decided by games. EVERYTHING.\n\nand Blank never loses.\n\n img(http://i.imgur.com/S4epjLA.jpg)\n\n  Story (15/30) and Characters (11/30) \n\nIt is based around NEETs and gaming, so you can probably guess where all the high ratings are coming from. However, I don't really see it in comparison to others of its supposed genre, say, BTOOM! or SAO. I consider it more of a fantasy series than one based around the \"drawn into a game\" one. This is because of its lack of any \"survival\" whatsoever and the fact that the characters don't really care for their own world any more. The only similarity is perhaps the overpowered main character(s).\n\nThat said, NGNL isn't exactly unique in its premise. It has been done plenty of times before, examples being Ixion Saga or Dog Days or even Zero no Tsukaima or the countless others of its type, all of which relied on calling people from a different world into a different world for the sake of ensuring the underdog's survival.\n\nStill, the execution was quite new. But, that does not mean it was good. The biggest reason for this is that blank never loses. The overpowered main duo just pretty much walk through everything. But before they win, the plot decides to throw a lot of thrills in and overall spice it up. Now that would be a good thing if not for the fact that the thrills are cheap. Almost below the belt. In every single game blank looks like they are going to lose, but end up winning through a needle's edge, but if you look at it clearly, there was really no reason for it to be so, since blank pulls something out of their ass to win the game (which they supposedly set up before the game even started). The story then downplays its earlier shocked characters by saying \"They ACTED like they were losing, you know, to trick their opponents! To trick them I said!\"  ~!Like in the shiritori game, it wasn't needed for the game to be played for as long as they did, even if the first thing Sora had played was Coloumb's force, they would have won, since there is literally no way to counteract it as it stood in the series.!~\n\nWhich is quite opposite what the characters actually do. Sora LOVES boasting about how he beat the other person by explaining why and when they lost to him and is just good old cocky. For such a person to act defeated....it just doesn't sit right.\n\n img(http://i.imgur.com/35PUdch.jpg)\n\n\nThe main characters pretty much just walk in the world, read the rules and start taking out one person after the other. Which is conveniently addressed by \"they are geniuses\". They beat top dogs in a world where gaming is literally everything and they don't even break a sweat. After all, the game is over before it begins. Sora also has the uncanny ability to cold read others. Now, while good cold readers can usually figure out a good bunch, they still can't psycho-analyze others from half a mile away without ever looking at them. Sora can do all of that -because, once again, he is a genius- and then even know what knowledge they get fed and what decisions the person makes without so much as batting an eye. Which is, once again, quite convenient - especially considering that Sora has mental breakdowns when he goes near another person, so he clearly lacks any practice on the subject. \n\nThis brings us to the \"faults\" in the characters as seen from the story's perspective. The major fault in Sora and Shiro is that they can't socialize or even be apart without totally collapsing. Which might sound limiting, but its effects are seen nowhere in the entire (non-comedic side of the) storyline. After all, Sora can give speeches to make armies defect, make the entire city cheer for them and walk into a bar and chat up some girl into a game just fine despite having done any of the above before. The story once again excuses this by calling them geniuses.\n\n img(http://i.imgur.com/YjevTRl.jpg)\n\nA major component of the entire series are the games being played. The question here isn't whether blank wins (since they never lose) but about HOW they win. Not counting all the \"thrills\" I mentioned earlier, there isn't anything terribly wrong with the games. The first game (rock paper scissors) was interesting, chess was just fine and most other games were more or less fun.Exceptions being, the shiritori game and the FPS. They just abused the artistic license to get away with absolute bullshit. Now, I usually don't question physics in any anime. Girl wants to hit a nosebled guy across the earth with an umbrella? Be my guest. But if the story decides that it suddenly wants to take use ACTUAL high school physics, I expect it to carry it out properly without looking like a dumbass. I really don't like bringing up science as a standpoint against a series, but if the series is going to use actual science as a plot point and pretty much the decider of a game of wits, it can't use BROKEN science as a winning condition.\n\n ~!In the FPS, Once again, the story saw fit to play the genius card by making Shiro (for a change) into an absolute godly gamer. She can make her shots bounce off off a gazzilion walls and hit a target miles away from her. This is after all, because she is good at FPS games. Wait, back up, back up. I'm good at Call of Duty. Can I -in real life- snipe a guy across the dessert while falling from a water tanker? I doubt it. Just because I'm good at a game doesn't mean I can achieve jack shit in real life. The story mentions time and again that even though the players aren't physically transported into the game, the software doesn't modify the players and they pretty much remain as they were in the real world (like how Sora starts panting after running a while). Shiro still plays the game like she was in an assisted simulator. Other than that, Shiro is also able to track where NPCs will walk (and bets the entire game on this) despite never having looked at the code and not even knowing all the interactions that the NPCs are capable of. Once again, this is conveniently explained by \"She is a genius\". !~\n\n img(http://i.imgur.com/VTTpHH1.jpg)\n\nAfter that comes the comedy. I can't really say the comedy is actually even funny, its more like a \"stupid people doing stupid things\" sort of a comedy. Where the only comedic relief is that someone is doing something totally crazy, or when other characters are humiliated. Stephanie Dola usually ends up being the butt of both the comedy and the ecchi side of things. Sora deems it fit to utterly humiliate her so that the audience can have a laugh. He (and his elite sister) see it fit to strip her of all her clothes, walk her around town, treat her like a literal dog (chain and all), then make her dress in a revealing dog costume after which they tie her to a pole and leave her there for the entire town to see. This is what passes for comedy and the plot completely agrees with it. After such an act towards one of their friends, I just couldn't bring myself to like Blank. I never liked them anyways, but after this I hated them. There is a limit that you can just brush off with a \"this is comedy\". That said, NGNL did make some clever jokes every now and then which made me chuckle. At the same time, there were references and overused memes (arrow to the knee) that made me want to punch the screen.\n img(http://i.imgur.com/wtvQLsZ.jpg)\n\nEcchi is probably one section where it delivers what it says. Of course, it would be better without it, but that's besides the point. Even without the BDs, NGNL has a fair amount of fanservice which bypasses the censors by downright not drawing nether region and nipples. So it can still give a lot of fap material without actually being a mass of floating pixels. Then again, the ecchi dominates large parts of the show (in ep06, ten minutes or half the episode is just blatant fanservice) and it ruins the series a bit, but since it said ecchi on the tin, can't really argue against it.\n\n img(http://i.imgur.com/OaB4P12.jpg)\n\nOn the other hand, the world and its creation were rather interesting. After having read so much fiction and LOTR rip-offs, NGNL created a fairly nice world and its lore was quite interesting. While my interests were more towards the Flugels, I really liked pretty much everything except humanity's history, which was just personal preference. It was pretty interesting overall. I did find the lack of revolts or actual problems of the realm rather quite disturbing, but the story does provide some (no matter how half assed) reasoning to it. \n\nWith all that said, I don't think that the plot was anything above average. Not because it was generic, but because every froward move it made was usually accompanied by a step backwards. Despite being interesting, it wasn't able to be anything beyond that. I think NGNL is one series that is best viewed mindlessly and after just \"going with the flow\". Dedicated watching is just gonna wreck it. But even with the benefit of doubt on having a S2, not closing the first season even half-properly was just terrible.\n\nThe main characters on the other hand were despicable, but I still graded it higher because at least Steph was pitiable and Jibril was kind of fun.\n\n Artwork and Animation (6/10) \n\nThe artwork was rather unique with its bright vibrant colors and freely drawn landscapes. That said, it wasn't anything spectacular. It was just....fine. There wasn't anything that made me go \"whoa check THAT out!\" and the background was  a bit sparsely detailed but it made up for that with character shading. It doesn't really handle saturation boosts too well, so it was a bit annoying having to revert my monitor to normal setting every week just to watch this.\n\n img(http://i.imgur.com/EV2zZiC.jpg)\n\nThe animation was more or less fluid and the conversion to slapstickiness is just fine and ecchi is abundant.\n\nI think the art is fine, there isn't really anything more to say, if you like the freaky colors, then good for you, if you don't, then too bad.\n\n Sound and Music (8/10)\n\nThe VA cast was pretty solid. But considering how little the emotions are worth in the main series, I think this was a bit of an unratable area for me. I mean, I suppose they did a good job, but I don't really know.\n\nThat said, I do know that the BGMs were intense and enjoyable. The sound of the surrounding world was raised to give a more 'epic' view, and I think that part was just fine. \n\n img(http://i.imgur.com/OZ0ir1P.jpg)\n\nThe music is and always has been a matter of taste, and while I thought that the OP1 was good, its long version is pretty average. This could either be because the OP01 has a great AMV to support it, or it could be because the long version is good old meh. The TV version was more than fine and I listened to it every time. The ED01 was also quite good, but nothing I wanted to download the long version of and listen to.\n\nThat said, despite being overall fair, I don't think it was good enough to join the league of 17/20 sound series like say Durarara or Kyoukai Senjou No Horizon.\n\n Enjoyment (14/20)\n\nTo be perfectly fair, NGNL was quite fun to watch. Not because it was a good piece of writing or even had half decent storytelling, but because it was interesting. And then there were the games that kept you wondering. After all, cheap thrills are still thrills. That said, NGNL isn't anything more than that, its just....fun. If you can switch your brain off and just watch it as you would some cheap knockoff cartoon, then it certainly can be quite good. Sadly, I can't, and feel it necessary to analyze the story. But even with that, NGNL was pretty enjoyable from start to end, but only if I lose myself in it.\n\n img(http://i.imgur.com/EQgmKCa.jpg)"}, {"id": 531, "score": 60, "body": "Ranma \u00c2\u00bd is the father of tsundere and the grandfather of wacky romantic comedy hijinks. Not exactly the best track record, is it? Alas, as a critic, I'm too honest to say that Ranma is a good show. But, odd as it may seem, it is a very enjoyable one nonetheless. Sound confusing? I don't completely understand it either, but I'll do my damnedest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n __Story:__ Most of us are probably familiar with the general premise of the show. Boy gets cursed such that every time he gets splashed with cold water he turns into a girl, and then proceeds to move into the home of his arranged fianc\u00c3\u00a9e. Hilarity ensues. Beyond that, there's not a whole lot to say about the \"story\" of this show, as it's very episodic. For the most part, you can expect everything to be the same at the end of an episode as it was at the start... or, if not, it's a two-episode story arc, and you can expect things to go back to normal after the next episode. More characters (ie, comedy fodder) are introduced throughout the series, but it sticks to its episodic formula up until the very end, and there's no real development to be observed. Spoiler: Ranma and Akane will be just as awkward and tsundere towards each other by the end of the very last episode as they were at the start of the first. Such is the fundamental flaw of much of Takahashi's long-running bodies of work. But, familiar characters and easy-to-follow storylines are king in the world of comedy cartoons, so Ranma is just another victim of the genre, I'm afraid.\r\n\r\n __Art:__ It's an old show, so it's got pretty old art and animation. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as both remain consistent throughout the show's run and don't detract from one's enjoyment of the show. At least, I don't think they should. Fans of old-school animation the likes of Dragon Ball and Sailor Moon rejoice, because here you'll find it in spades, along with...\r\n\r\n __Sound:__ ...that classic 80's/90's cheap-but-nostalgic soundtrack sound. The music from this series is really nothing special\u00e2\u0080\u0094no soaring melodies or epic chords. But prepare for the earworm of those wacky Chinese hijinks riffs to be in your head for a long, long time, because there's no one who's seen this series who wouldn't recognize the music immediately. The Japanese dub is par for the course, and even features Kappei Yamaguchi (Lelouch, Usopp, and many others) singing a duet in about the sweetest damn closing sequence of all time in a set of OVA's. The English dub... varies a bit. The many seasons of Ranma span the transition between the dark ages (Ocean DBZ, Sailor Moon) and the period where dubbing started to be taken seriously (thanks, FUNimation). Thus, the first season or two is a little bit on the shoddy side\u00e2\u0080\u0094albeit still listenable\u00e2\u0080\u0094and improves pretty dramatically as the series progresses, actors become more comfortable with their roles, and some are replaced outright for the better. Despite the inconsistencies, it's still a perfectly enjoyable dub, and my preferred viewing experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo what exactly is Ranma's saving grace, then? I've described incredibly cheesy plotlines, dated artwork, and a laughably corny music score. But when you put it all together, what you get is this almost-grindhouse-goofy piece of animation that just makes you chuckle at how delightfully cheesy it is. And as a comedy, that means it's done its job, right? Ranma \u00c2\u00bd may not be the thought-provoking pinnacle of writing that Satoshi Kon may have spawned... in fact, it's just the opposite. It's the kind of show that lets you just kind of turn your brain off for 20 minutes and enjoy the ride. Shows that make you think are important, but this can be fun at times, too. If you're the classic anime viewer who likes to reminisce about the good old days of 80's/90's anime, and you haven't seen Ranma, I recommend giving it a watch. It's a fun, goofy ride from start to finish."}, {"id": 558, "score": 50, "body": "Every now and then, you come across something so average that it's almost impressive. \"Wow,\" you tell yourself. \"How did this manage to be so okay at everything without managing to cross into good?\" Black Bullet is one of these rare gems of mediocrity: the foundation is solid and everything built upon it holds up, but it's not quite well-crafted enough to truly be considered stable.\r\n\r\nBlack Bullet is the story of Rentaro Satomi, a young man working for the Japanese government as a \"promotor\" to fight against monsters created by the Gastrea Virus. Aiding him is the ten-year-old \"initiator\" Enju Aihara. Initiators are known as the \"cursed children\" due to their superhuman abilities. Also, they're all underage girls. Don't ask why they have to be underage girls. They just do. Shut up and let them do their blatant pandering to lolicons. Rentaro and Enju begin by combating Gastrea, but later a masked man called Kagetane Hiruko and an impending collapse of a monolith defending Tokyo both threaten to destroy the city.\r\n\r\nIf you think this sounds like an interesting concept, you'd probably be right. Conceptually, this is a very strong series. The animal-themed initiators make for an interesting magic system and the plot is solid enough. However, the show overall feels a bit lackluster, probably due to the low amount of character development. There are plenty of scenes that should be tear-jerking or emotionally powerful. The cursed children in particular get a raw deal and if the series had managed to follow through on what it was trying to do, it would have been filled with heartbreaking moments showcasing just how thoroughly these young girls' lives had been destroyed just because they were different. Unfortunately, when terrible things happened they usually happened to characters with little to no character development or plot importance, and it's hard to take the whole cursed children tragedy seriously when they're used more for cutesy fanservicey scenes than for a serious, mature story. Yes, there were plenty of times times that I said \"that sure is terrible,\" but I said it when I should have been moved to tears.\r\n\r\nUltimately, Black Bullet just doesn't do enough. It's like someone drank a can of Darker than Blackweiser and said \"you know, this is really good but it's a little too strong for me\" and then went on to make Black Bullight and while it does still kind of taste like Blackweiser it's watered down and has this sort of skunky loli taste to it but it's still enough to get you buzzed and once you've had a few you don't really notice the loli taste that much anyway. And frankly, if I wanted to see that, I'd just rewatch Darker than Black: Gemini of the Meteor  _oh snaaaap_ but no seriously that's basically what Black Bullet is.\r\n\r\nIf you're really into action anime, particularly ones with sci-fi or urban fantasy elements, you'll probably like Black Bullet. But it falls short of better shows in its genre and it doesn't bring much to the table. It's definitely not a bad show. It has solid writing, a great magic system, a few interesting characters among the sea of uninteresting ones, and a bit of humor along the way. It's just brought down by a few unfortunate pitfalls and an overall unwillingness to capitalize upon its full potential. If you like this type of show, go ahead and watch it. But if it's not your usual thing, give it a pass. It's not that it's a waste of your time. It's that there are shows your time is better spent on.

The series attempts to convey a stylistic array of provocative commentary on the human condition whilst maintaining a heavy emphasis on pathos, and, to an extent, succeeds. The final result is a mix-mash of both individual stories and overall quality, dark and disturbing, yet definitely not without its flaws. \n\nGiven the structure of the series, it's best if I give my individual thoughts for each of the six arcs, as there are major discrepancies in terms of production quality and overall effect. \n\n # _No Longer Human_ - Osamu Dazai\n***\nThe first and longest of the six arcs,  _No Longer Human_ is the flagship story of the series and focuses on the demise of teenager Yozo Oba as he enters a cycle of depression, substance abuse, sex and insanity. The arc excels at establishing a tenuous relationship between the main character and the audience, where his emotions  and angst are communicated with disturbing vividness, prompting a sort of apprehensive sympathy. Similarly, it does a brilliant job at presenting the world as an ubiquitously twisted and troubled one, where the general feelings of disgust in our main character are easily understood and to an extent, even justified whilst setting the atmosphere for the rest of the series. \n\n\n~~~img320(https://66.media.tumblr.com/14152a3254ac64950f006ae791987c5f/tumblr_od8y4aPO0k1ukft4wo1_500.gif)~~~\nMy biggest qualm with this segment lies in the development of Yozo's character. We never really gain an in-depth insight into the reasoning behind his demise. Sure we grasp the basics, but we never fully understand the intricacies behind his psyche at the different stages of his life. Whilst the feelings of sorrow, guilt, humiliation and fear are easily comprehended, the cause of these feelings isn't, and thus all we're left to follow is a disturbed man lacking in any substance. The pacing of the story is also questionable, where awkward flashbacks and time skips leads to the arc becoming slow and repetitive. Visuals are characterized by a dull color palate which works well in establishing the mood, same can be said with the soundtrack (a trend maintained throughout the series).  _No Longer Human_ succeeds in drawing our attention, but it doesn't perform so well in conveying anything besides the general themes and emotions. \n\n#  _In the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom_ - Ango Sakaguchi\n***\n\nProbably one of the most perplexing of the stories, this arc focuses on a countryside bandit who falls in love with a city woman he captures and marries. On the visual level, there is an immediate shift from the sombreness of  _No Longer Human_ to the bright and vivid style of  _In the Forest_, with even a few quirky jokes here and there. Make no mistake, however, as the sinister and violent undertones are just as prominent here as they are in the first arc. Personally, the juxtaposition between visuals and atmosphere wasn't as much unsettling as it was distracting, but you may think differently. \n\n~~~img320(https://38.media.tumblr.com/03839a27fe5cd7d157c1b68bfa054828/tumblr_n9mzwxGeq41td6zwdo1_500.gif)~~~\n\nIt was rather interesting to observe the progress of our two main characters, ultimately culminating to a somewhat challenging conclusion that really makes you think about what this arc was trying to communicate. If anything, there is a heavy emphasis on self-awareness and self-understanding, where the consequences of not being able to grasp the truths of one's own character and nor being able to penetrate the outer-fronts of others may be incredibly dire.\n\n#  _Kokoro_ - Natsume Soseki\n***\n\nOne of the more fleshed out stories, this arc follows two friends, a physically imposing monk and a more refined man as they compete for the affections of the same woman. What this really excels in is structure, where two episode are dedicated to the story, one from each man's perspective. As such, an immensely deep insight is gained into the two different characters, where stereotypes collapse and motivations and actions are explained, leading to interesting commentary on the jealousy, prejudice and mutual misunderstanding common to both men. It ultimately is rather tragic, and a sort of poetic beauty is established. This is easily one of the better arcs.\n\n#  _Run, Melos!_ - Osamu Dazai\n***\n\nMy personal favorite of the series,  _Run, Melos!_ once again has a unique structural presentation where it follows a playwright writing a version of the classical Greek tragedy \"Run, Melos\". This leads nicely into a mise-en-abyme scenario, where we have a play within the events that are actually occurring, which is utilized to great effect. Our young playwright struggles, however, as he does not agree with the themes of the play due to a past experience where he was seemingly betrayed by his best friend. The end result in a beautifully orchestrated story which addresses the question 'is it more painful to wait or to keep someone else waiting?' Our characters are incredibly dynamic, as both childhood friends are constantly transitioning between embodying either Melos or Selinuntius respectively, which in turn raises some interesting questions regarding the fickleness of trust and conveys various emotions of guilt and despair. It gets a bit melodramatic at times, although considering its roots as a Greek tragedy, it's forgivable. The production quality was notably of a higher standard, and this arc is easily the most uplifting.\n\n~~~img320(https://0.viki.io/v/207558/bdf22fe19d5ccb4787f222eb286240a2f8c2c983.png?x=b&s=590x330&q=h&e=t&f=t&cb=1)~~~\n\n#  _The Spider's Thread_ and  _Hell Screen_ - Ryunosuke Akutagawa \n***\n\n _The Spider's Thread_ follows a violent outlaw and his journey into hell whilst  _Hell Screen_ addresses a painter who feels obligated to paint the atrocities of the world around him; both take place in the same setting. An intense and vivid visual style is utilized, which leads to some truly spectacular and confronting scenes. There two arcs are undoubtedly the most simplistic, each only a single episode long- and it shows. The main characters in both stories are horrendously underdeveloped and are molded to fit a single, archetype/caricature in order to convey the principal themes. Speaking of which, the principal themes aren't particular complex either, and the commentary presented is more or less a simple statement of a particular aspect of human nature (with a heavy focus on self-egotism) as opposed to an actual exploration of said aspect.  The end result are two stories that, although successful in effectively emphasizing these various aspects of the human condition, (there's some interesting stuff on artistic integrity thrown into the mix as well), are lacking in any real depth of character or analysis. \n\n~~~img320(https://annoyingdragon.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/the-hell-screen.jpg?w=440&h=240&crop=1)~~~\n\nWhilst the stories of  _Aoi Bungaku_ do an excellent job at conveying emotion and atmosphere, some do a far better job than others at presenting genuinely thought-provoking material. This inequality can be attributed to a number of things, whether it be actual construction or how dynamic the characters are. Ultimately, it is this discrepancy in depth that prevents the series from being truly amazing.

Some time ago an artist by the name of Mohiro Kitoh sat down and decided to write a story about children sodomizing and butchering each other. This wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t unusual for him, after all; he even distinctly draws his characters as scrawny, frail, dilapidated pseudo-corpses, then suddenly mutilates them in the most horrific ways. He is like George R.R. Martin, only far less nudity and number of years per character. He then, in the most Machiavellian sense, sells this maddening battleship of a series to a kids\u00e2\u0080\u0099 television network, who promptly pick it up deceived by cute kids flying on goofy looking puppet thingies. Brilliant, right?\n\nIn some of my reading I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found that this has to do with creativity through misanthropy\u00e2\u0080\u0094Kitoh\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  _Narutaru_ intentionally appeals to children, when in fact he knows that it is not for them.  His sense of artistry inundates the series with all of the tragic flaws imaginable distributed equally among the main characters. Were it not for the pathetic budget, the extreme content, and the deceptively cute dragonets which probably scarred the minds of several million Japanese children AND most likely bereaved that said kids\u00e2\u0080\u0099 station of money through punitive lawsuits,  _Narutaru_ could easily have been developed as one of the most controversial anime in history.\n\n(DISCLAIMER: I do not know if anyone actually seriously got hurt by this series\u00e2\u0080\u00a6ahem, except those who were in the actual series\u00e2\u0080\u00a6but I can assure that this could have at least been an alternate reality for us in the real world had the show been more popular.)\n\n __A fascinating story! Too bad it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thirteen jumbled episodes of W and T and F.__ (55/100)\nVisiting her grandparents by the sea, Tamai Shiina encounters a strange, star-shaped creature lurking in the depths by a torii on the coastline. After a series of events and sky surfing, she decides to name it \u00e2\u0080\u009cHoshimaru.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She returns to the shabby apartment and her normal lifestyle, struggling to find strength and success at the Banda Academy Junior High. Strange things, however, have begun to occur around her, as the world of dragons and humans begin to intertwine and blood begins to spill.\n\nI think Kitoh\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vision in the manga is probably significantly clearer, as the nonsense I just threw together to describe the plot is probably the best I could come up with despite having watched the series twice.  The fact is,  _Narutaru_ did not have the budget it needed to be a success. From what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve explored, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an entire season of information about Dragons worth learning, as is the possibility of another season just outlining events to come after the gritty conclusion of episode 13. The series leaves a great deal of plot holes and mysteries unanswered, so much so that the point doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really even seem to come across. I could easily just summarize the point of this series as \u00e2\u0080\u009clife sucks and then you die BY getting ripped in half through your vagina\u00e2\u0080\u009d and probably get a nod of approval from the production team. Albeit smugly due to the limited time span they were offered to jam pack disturbing material.\n\n __Characters do make up for this considerably.__ (82/100)\nPerhaps the best thing about  _Narutaru_ is its virtually original cast. Shiina seems to be your typical teenage nitwit, when in fact the great deal of dark thoughts she has leave us shuddering in our hearts for her. Akira, too, cannot be compared with any typical supporting character. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neither strong nor weak, and while she has a tendency to panic and seclude herself, she also demonstrates a serious affinity for violence as the series carries on (and in the manga directly points out the horrifying cause for her suicidal personality.)\n\nTakeo, Norio, and Hiroko all surprised me. I could not place a finger on any of them. It is easy to blab that Hiroko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sudden change in episode 12 is a deus ex machina to fit the budgeted time limit, but the shock factor keeps us guessing right when the series seems to get boring. Hiroko, in fact, might be the closest of all of them to a trending character, though we cannot help but highly sympathetic to her after a certain bullying scene bares  _Narutaru_ of all of its childlike perceptions.\n\nI would go so far as to say that despite the short period of time, the characters developed more quickly and more consistently than even other, decade later produced dark series of this nature like  _Madoka_ or  _WIXOSS/_. Each character reaches a boiling point and takes a serious risk to change their life; some of them end up dismembered, some of them end up prevailing and dismembering someone else. Either way, the upfront and blatant disregard for innocence forces us to empathize with each of them, and even more so when we see the creepier side to revenge.\n\n __Low budget animation, with unappreciable figures.__ (55/100)\nI will take this time to make another dig at Kitoh\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choice of drawing.  Shiina is a stick, drawn quite frail and lanky to put off any degree of sexual arousal. I do realize that there is more to life than sex, but the lack of meat on her bones as well as the rest of the cast eliminates any desire to seek fanservice and limiting the audience only to the mentally depraved.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a6oh. Me. \n\nAnyways, while it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really matter much that the characters are specifically made this way, maybe Kitoh wants this sort of reaction. Witnessing them get crushed or ripped and half by their orifices raises the degree of carnage when demonstrated on feebler structures, so I guess I can understand where that might come from. Still, though, what kind of bad trip did Kitoh have when he designed the dragons? Sure they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re cute, but then just look at little closer. Then look a little closer than that. THEN CLOSER THAN THAT. The dragons probably contribute the most disturbing visuals in this series. Stuff gets impaled, dismembered, raped, and bludgeoned by these things with those beady eyes!\n\n img320(http://i.imgur.com/si12klD.jpg)\n_Did I mention that this will haunt you after you watch this series?_\n\nI should add as a good point:  __much of the actual violence is unseen.__ Meaning? Whenever any violence occurs, the gruesome stuff is usually done very subtly or without an actual presentation. This is typical of action in shoujo anime; while great in  _Pretear_ or _Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne_, it is mortifying in  _Narutaru,_ as the subtlety doubles the creepiness.\n\nAside from that, there was some degree of laziness in the action parts of the series. It was gritty to begin with, but repeated frames and patterned backgrounds only indicate that there was little desire to make the series more approachable on the action end. This is a critical mistake, as  _Narutaru_ does feature some sort of competition among the kids. It would have benefited greatly with a degree more focus on the actual character movements.\n\n __Freaky ass music.__ (90/100)\nIf the beginning of episode one and the ghoulish wailing wind didn't make you look over your shoulder, then  _Narutaru_ won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be much of a freakout festival for you. Even the song during the eye catch makes one feel like they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re being cursed by viewing the series. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an all-out frightening experience aurally and suits the mood perfectly despite the immature material.\n\nThe opening and ending themes are nice little catchy songs. The OP is another proof of deception, utilizing a harmonica to jam and a cute dance walk by all of the leads. Then you actually study and see what they are doing during the OP and witness yet again\u00e2\u0080\u00a6ANOTHER WTF moment (in particular, watch and try to guess what Hoshimaru secretly eats when Shiina isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t looking during the opening, and then all the other freaky stuff will start to come out of the background.)\n\nAlso, the voice acting is superb. Akira and Hiroko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seiyuu really had to put out a high degree of emotional fear through their voices, and they succeeded. Akira\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scream gave me a pretty serious chill, as did Hiroko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plea for help. I feel the best elements of this series came aurally and would be a great reference for future dark shoujo series of the same nature.\n\n __Friends of depravity, here is your alcoholic drink.

Not even the most mentally fit\u00e2\u0080\u0094 _Narutaru_ is an experience that requires a strong palate and prepared mind for disturbing ideas. I recommend it only to fans of Kitoh\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work, or those who really got the weirdness of  _Madoka_ long before the actual dark elements settled into the story."}, {"id": 697, "score": 65, "body": "I consider myself a pretentious artsy bullshit type. I like things like The Tatami Galaxy, Psycho-Pass, and Mushi-shi, where there's a heavy intellectual and/or artistic level to them. So I went into my first Kunihiko Ikuhara show with fairly strong expectations, since it sounded and looked like I would get both of those from this show.\n\nThe first few episodes absolutely hooked me. I loved the idea of an anime actually exploring the idea of sexuality rather than using it as a punchline or fanservice. I loved figuring out what all the symbols and motifs meant. I loved finding the little bits of repetition and seeing how the usage was the same or different each time. It was like watching a puzzle, and it was fascinating.\n\nUnfortunately, when the pieces of that puzzle started falling into place and the bigger picture came into view, I found myself saying \"_this_ is what I devoted all that time and energy on?\"\n\nYurikuma Arashi (translatable to \"Lesbian Bear Storm,\" but probably more accurately \"Lily Bear Storm\") tells the story of girls, bears, girls who are also bears, and girls and bears who are lesbians. It's a tale of love, exclusion, jealousy, revenge...well, basically, it's a tale about the emotions and relationships of a bunch of high school girls. There's all sorts of imagery and motifs of lily flowers and bears and birds and freedom and judgment that tie into the themes of the series. Those are the important parts of the show. What's that, you say? I've forgotten to actually talk about the plot? No, no, I covered the important parts of the show. Those parts, unfortunately, just don't include a plot.\n\nThis is Yurikuma Arashi's greatest failing. In all the visual imagery and repeated phrases and thematic focus, it neglects to tell an actual story. It's as if Ikuhara started with the theme, in this case, \"romantic relationships between girls and how they're perceived by society,\" and then came up with symbols he wanted to include and points he wanted to make and built the story around that. Each episode is so concerned with artistic flashbacks and compelling repetition that the narrative becomes a scattered mess that moves far too slowly. It devotes so much time into making sure the show has substance that it fails to connect on an emotional level. There is no payoff. No moment that makes you go \"oh, so _that's_ what the bears represent!\" The symbols are something that you'll be trying to figure out the entire time because as soon as you think you know what something represents, you say \"well, it could also mean this other thing, too.\" The consequence is that, even the biggest draw of the show feels like it stalls out with no purpose.\n\nPerhaps the most apt idiom to describe Yurikuma Arashi is that it misses the forest for the trees. It gets so bogged down with all the little details that it fails to be cohesive, haphazardly jumping around so that scenes go where the symbolism demands rather than the narrative. It's a real shame, because the show would have had a ton of potential had it managed to pull its head out of its ass. Maybe if it were half as long, it would have had tighter pacing and been more cohesive. As it stands, it's artistic, and it's even artistic with purpose--but it's not artistic with direction. It is art for the sake of art, and that unfortunately doesn't make it inherently good. Three stars."}, {"id": 703, "score": 60, "body": "Punch Line is a modestly ecchi themed anime, that fortunately does not stick to it very strongly for the majority of the show. The introduction is understandably giddy and, luckily, tries not to take itself too seriously. Panties, nosebleeds, apocalypse, the trailer definitely does those justice, but don't let it fool you. The focus of the show switches to a more suitable theme very quickly, saving the viewers--mine for sure--interest. The somewhat serious nature of the show, with comedy relief, gives a decent mix of dark undertones and dumb up-skirt. If you're looking for an ecchi harem comedy, this isn't the place to stop. The themes are much more serious and subtle, with only a sprinkling of the panty shots in the early episodes.\n\nThe soundtrack was pretty well crafted, but is honestly not memorable at all. It is very quiet and non-invasive, instead adding to the atmosphere of any given scene. I cannot recall a single tune or melody after finishing the show, and failed to come up with anything substantial skimming throught the episodes or checking videos online. The opening theme, however, is quite memorable. It starts out being a rather irritating poppy tune resembling the supposed underwear centric show, but grows to be more cheeky and a very excellent contrast to the actual mood of the shows middle and ending arcs.\n\nThe secondary characters in Punch Line eventually become lovable, though extremely ditzy and irritating early on. An extensive amount of time is spent on the viewers chances to learn about everyone and their personalities--slice of life--and none of the characters are snubbed of their deserved time on screen. The main character, and their past, is especially interesting. I wont comment on Chiranosuke... not a fan.\n\nI would recommend this as a filler anime if you're contemplating on the next 50+ episode anime you'd like to watch. Though it was an enjoyable experience, Punch Line is not a must watch nor is it outstanding by any means. Give it a try if you're having trouble picking something worth your while."}, {"id": 725, "score": 50, "body": "Have you ever had that situation where you love the beginning of an anime but the rest of the series doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t turn out to well? You get disappointed and just want to forget all the things that were bad. That is how it was with Photokano for me. Photokano is a 13 episode romance school TV series produced by Madhouse. It aired from April 5, 2013 to Jun 28, 2013. \n\nThis series is about Maeda Kazuya, a normal high school boy that receives a digital camera from his father. He starts to get interested in photographing which opens a lot of doors for him.  During the series he comes across people he would never had talked to if it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for his new found hobby.\n\nThe structure of this series is pretty simple. It starts off with four episodes of introduction where you get to meet all the characters. Then the series becomes arc based. This is when it becomes problematic. Every arc is focused on one of the girls that Maeda meets. During these arcs Maeda helps the girls with their problems and also starts a relationship with them. The problem here is that the arcs are very short. Most of them only last for one episode. This makes them very rushed. This structure also makes it feel like the story doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t progress so much.The photo theme is very interesting and was the reason for me checking this series out. They did handle it pretty well although they could added a bit more of it. Again the bad structure prevents from doing this.\n\nThe main characters Maeda Kazuya isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that special of a character but he is likeable. He doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have so much development or a backstory, but this works because the focus is more on the main girls. The girls are many. So many that I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take the time to talk about each one of them. The good thing about them is that even if they are so many they still have interesting and unique backstories. But then we do also have a problem with the amount of girls. As I said before the arcs is only one episode and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because every girls is going to have one. The lack of time makes them really rushed and the main character barley gets to start a relationship before he has to move on to the next girl. I think the series would have been better if it had a smaller cast of girls.\n\nThe series also have few supporting characters. These characters don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get so much screen time because of the focus on the main girls. This is pretty disappointing because some of where really good and funny. My favorite character of the series is Kudou Hiromichi, the leader of the photo club Maeda joins. He does only appear a few times during the series and most of his appearance comes from the previews which he narrates.\n\nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have so much to say about art and animation. It holds a good standard. My favorite part was how they did the photographing. It looked nice and beautiful. One of my favorite things about this series is the great feeling you get. You feel calm and relaxed. The biggest reason for this is the background music. It is always used at the right time and set such a good tone in the scene. The voice acting was good. There weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any performances I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like. My favorite performance in this series came from Midorikawa Hikaru who played the character I talked about earlier Kudou Hiromichi.\n\nPhotokano is a series that sets high expectations that it can't live up to. It follows the classic dating sim structure which is not a bad structure, but it has to be handled well. Photokano has a great intro but has a really bad structure. In this case it's the structure that decides if this series is very good or just good. This series would have worked out a lot better if it just where longer or had a smaller cast. Even with the bad structure the series has some interesting characters and it gives a really good feeling which is the first thing that comes to my mind when I think back on Photokano."}, {"id": 727, "score": 55, "body": "Ansatsu Kyoushitsu, AKA Assassination Classroom, has the sort of fun and silly premise that anime tends to become known for. It features on a classroom full of academically backwards students who are trying to kill their teacher--who is also a yellow smiley face with the body of a tentacle monster--before he destroys the earth at the end of the year. He can do it, too. He's already proved that by blowing a hole in the moon.\n\nAssassination Classroom certainly has some fun moments, mostly related to Koro-sensei's personality and how his body functions. But these moments tend to get repetitive fairly quickly, and the flaws of the series threaten to outweigh them. The rest of the cast is fairly lackluster. This is likely a side effect of its Too-Many-Characters Syndrome. There is an entire classroom worth of students, all of them introduced in the OP, but only one or two are memorable. I can think of four off the top of my head: Nagisa, Karma, Ritsu, and that one dude who has something close to a character arc but not a good enough one that I can actually remember his name. The rest are just a blur of faces and names that have pretty much no real relevance.\n\nWhat's more, the story doesn't often go anywhere. It is, as most shounen, deliberately drawn out so that the franchise can be milked for all it's worth. The result is that the plot largely becomes filler. Over the course of twenty-two episodes, we spend a bit of time learning how Koro-sensei functions and what his strengths and weaknesses are. The rest of the show is filled with Koro-sensei doing teacher things and the class combating other villains. These diversions would almost be welcome were they not a distraction from the real story. Sure, it's good that we're getting character development for these professors and students, but there are more pressing concerns. Namely, \"why would such a cheerful creature threaten to destroy the Earth?\" and \"why does this creature want to teach a high school class?\" I can ignore that the moon getting a big hole blown through it doesn't mess with gravity or tides. I can ignore that Koro-sensei can fly at mach 20 and is basically a giant emoji. But I can't ignore that the entire premise of the series is built on unanswered questions. The longer it continues, the more it seems like it's simply an excuse to create this specific situation. But instead of addressing these questions, we get a vague comment about Koro-sensei being a man-made biological weapon, then shrug off any other answers in favor of adding new villains so that we don't have to kill of Koro-sensei until sales start declining.\n\nAssassination Classroom is a funny joke that drags on for about 15 episodes too long. Sure, the concept is fun, but a concept can't carry a show. There are too many characters for them to get fleshed out and the plot refuses to progress. What we're left with is a series with glaring questions that only become more frustrating the longer they go unanswered. And the worst part is that the show gives no indication that they're considering addressing them anywhere in the near future.

Supposedly, 73 year old Tomino had more creative control over G-Reco than any other of his previous Gundam series, and perhaps as a result reception regarding it has been fairly divided.\n\n~~~webm(https://a.pomf.cat/tgmmeo.webm)~~~\n___\n__Story 6/10__\nWhile intended to be watched as a standalone series, technically G-Reco is tied to previous Gundam series in that it is set some thousands of years after the original Gundam takes place. Within that unspecified allotment of time, humanity has regressed from constant warring and is therefore trying to prevent this from happening again through the use of a fairly complex power distribution and religious taboo system involving at least three different celestial bodies. Not that the audience will know this going in, as G-Reco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most interesting strength, as well as its most glaring flaw, is the way in which it presents its story.\nThe story itself is fine; boy meets Gundam, war ensues because reasons and he comes out the other side with a new perspective of the world. Obviously, the \u00e2\u0080\u0098war ensues\u00e2\u0080\u0099 part is a lot more complex than that and overall I found the power struggle between the four different factions to be pretty interesting, focusing more on skirmishes over a tangible energy source rather than the ideologically driven wars of previous Gundam series.\n\nThe problem comes from the execution. It is crystal clear that whoever designed the world G-Reco takes place in put a decent chunk of thought into it. The whole world operates through a religious system known as SU-Cordism, which revolves around an orbital elevator known as the Space Umbilical Cord, the one means through which people on Earth receive power in the form of Photon Batteries, delivered by the Crescent Ship from the people of the Venus Globe, who are protected by the Ten Police, and so on and so forth. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099re even explanations for how to use a mobile suit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s toilet and an entire race of humans who were once in the past used as a food source for other humans. While this may sound like a plot point waiting to happen, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually brought up maybe once or twice and very briefly at that. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so much detail poured into the creation of this world that there simply isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough time to show it all, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not even entirely sure if the cannibalism is explicitly mentioned in the series itself or only in pre-release articles.\n\n~~~img600(http://imgur.com/yRKXd0l.jpg)~~~\n\nI personally think G-Reco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach to storytelling is admirable, especially for anime, in that it pretty much just drops the viewer into this world and lets them figure it out as it progresses instead of through frequent expository dumps. However, when there are a million different silly Gundam names and terms being thrown about all at once with little explanation it becomes a little hard to follow for someone not equipped with a comprehensive G-Reco glossary. Adding to the confusion is the breakneck pacing, likely caused by the series\u00e2\u0080\u0099 relatively short length at 26 episodes, with events and dialogues going by so quick that if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fully comprehend each plot point as it happens you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re gonna be lost five minutes later. All of this adds up to a \u00e2\u0080\u0098blink and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll miss it\u00e2\u0080\u0099 watching experience that is frankly rather exhausting, as far as sitting on your ass and watching something goes. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not impossible to follow by any means, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure it could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been handled more elegantly.\n\n__Audio Visual 8/10__\nG-Reco is quite outstanding visually. The settings, characters and mobile suits are all bright and colourful and it really gives the show an energetic feel to it. Character designs by Kenichi Yoshida (_Eureka Seven, King Gainer_) are all unique and plenty are surprisingly memorable, considering two or three pop up and get added to the ridiculously large cast almost every episode.\n\n~~~img800(http://imgur.com/Tf82e8I.jpg)~~~\n\nAnother aspect that has a ridiculously large amount of designs are the mobile suits. G-Reco provides a venerable plethora of mobile suit designs, with plenty of grunt suits showing up for one or two episodes before being destroyed and never seen again. The sheer amount of suits packed into the 26 episodes is shocking in a good way, as they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t require characterisation or personality and generally don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t affect the plot that much, just serve as more mechanical eye candy. In terms of the designs themselves, I liked them a lot. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re refreshing, being generally rounder and softer than a lot of Gundam series and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a broad range of styles, a lot of which harken back to earlier series and a lot of which are completely new and unique. Hell, one of them is just a giant pyramid flying through space, which is pretty rad actually.\n\n~~~img600(http://imgur.com/ggOJbtj.jpg)~~~\n\nG-Reco also features some really impressive visual effects, most notably the glittery effect they apply to beams and thrusters, which makes anything involving beams, sparks, explosions or boosters a spectacle. It also makes good use of a render that digitally 'roughens' the linework, imitating 70s and 80s cel animation which I thought was a good way to evoke the series' lineage without bending over too far backwards to appeal to older fans. The combination of the visual effects, fantastic 2D mechanical animation (an unfortunate rarity in 2014), high quality choreography and some very explosive and punchy sound effects make the battles very satisfying and enjoyable to watch.\n___\n__Overall__\nG-Reco has almost everything it needs to be a good show, except for one apparently critical aspect: time. Unfortunately, what could've been a fun adventure through a unique and intricate post-apocalyptic solar system becomes just a mad dash from plot point to plot point, with the 'unique and intricate post-apocalyptic solar system' feeling almost like an afterthought. While some will claim that the director intended it to be confusing as a means to force the audience to pay attention in an act of social criticism, others will insist that the director is simply senile and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing anymore.\n\nSince it's airing, Tomino himself has claimed that he simply didn't feel like he could handle a 50 episode series at his age, which is a shame since that is exactly what this series needed.\n\n~~~img600(http://i.imgur.com/OVPyCsY.jpg)~~~"}, {"id": 829, "score": 55, "body": "Shingeki no Kyoujin, AKA Attack on Titan, is an absolutely fantastic anime. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the tale of a small faction of humanity fighting a hopeless battle against an overwhelming force that can and will kill each and every last one of them. And yet, despite being on the bottom of the food chain, faced with a natural predator that will drive them to extinction, they fight back. They rebel against nature itself, despite the fact that the battle seems hopeless. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSeid ihr das Essen? Nein, wir sind der Jaeger!\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you the food? No, we are the hunters!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I thought the show was grim, it was painful, it was depressing, and I loved every second of it.\n\nAnd then we got into the ninth episode.\n\nAttack on Titan is eight of the best episodes of anime I have ever watched, followed by the deepest betrayal I have ever experienced. Because after those first eight episodes, the show decides that it wants to completely ignore all the themes it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s built up and go a completely different direction with it. Suddenly, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the story of a desperate struggle of humanity to survive. Now it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part action, part mystery, and part political intrigue. This wouldn't necessarily be bad, but the mystery and political intrigue are, unfortunately, painfully mediocre and bring the show to a screeching halt.\n\nLet's talk about the good first. The technical aspects of the show are all incredible. The direction is fantastic, the music is fantastic, and while the art style isn't one that personally jives with me (the thick outlines throw me off a bit), it's distinct and I can see how many people would love it. Sure, it's a bit on the brown side, but it fits the tone and brown is in with the show's target demographic anyway. The setup, world, and overall aesthetic are all strong, and between all of these things, the show becomes instantly captivating. It's grimdark and edgy, but it's grimdark and edgy in a way that doesn't feel like it's insulting the viewers' intelligence. The violence and desperation are all a result of the world and the premise, and both of those are strong enough to work. It's dark to the point of being hard to watch at times, but in a way that kept me coming back, at least at the start. It got me invested in what happened to the characters and whether or not they could overcome these insurmountable odds. I actually cared about and became invested in them--again, at least at the start.\n\nOkay, now that I've gotten the praise out of the way, let me launch into why this show is a massive disappointment.\n\nOne of the largest issues with the show is the pacing. The first eight episodes move at a very quick pace as the world and premise are set up, the characters are introduced, and mysteries begin getting introduced. After that, a huge bombshell gets dropped on the audience, opening the door to many more mysteries. However, instead of addressing the how or why, the show instead spends five episodes establishing that yes, this did indeed happen, freaking out over the lack of information regarding it, and moving a boulder. This would be frustrating even if it weren't delaying the answer to questions we desperately want, because it takes up roughly 1/5 of the story and it builds up to a halfway-point climax that ultimately isn't particularly enthralling.\n\nThis issue with preserving mystery at the cost of killing momentum is something that happens continually throughout the series. Plot points are raised and consequently abandoned in favor of pursuing plot points we don't care about. We've just seen something that turns everything that has been established upside down! Do we really need to have a court session? When Eren joins the survey corps, why do we need scenes of them cleaning up their base? When it's established that there's probably something of very great importance in Eren's basement, shouldn't there be at least _some_ form of payoff for that instead of launching into the Female Titan arc? These issues only grow more pronounced in the manga, where several arcs are started, then cut short because following through on them would result in mysteries being answered, and apparently the author believes that as soon as someone gets answers they're going to stop reading.\n\nIn addition, Attack on Titan quickly introduces more characters than it knows how to handle. In the first episodes we begin to get a handle on who Erin, Mikasa, and Armin are, but only Mikasa gets any sort of backstory and after those initial episodes, she's mostly just relegated to a background character as well. Erin is full of passion, but in a way that makes him two-dimensional, and I expected Armin's story arc to actually go somewhere. I honestly thought that the story would be about them beginning to step out of his shadow, but again, that damn ninth episode happened and ruined any hope of that happening. The rest of the recruits are similarly bland. Jean gets something resembling a character arc and a few other characters suddenly become really important (most of them only in the manga), but others serve little to no purpose. Viewers know who Sasha is because she ate a potato in a funny scene. But that's literally all there is to remember about her character. She likes food. That's all she does. Her only purpose in the story is to _like food_. And Connie? Who even knows what purpose Connie serves.\n\nAfter the first eight episodes, the show starts to become a drag, with the plot beginning to go in multiple directions. The pacing slows down, but the slower pace isn't the main issue. It's that, instead of slower-paced forward motion, it becomes slower-paced sideways motion. What was once exciting suddenly becomes tedious to get through. Things begin to pick up again towards the end, with the climax of the Female Titan arc, when the titan's identity is revealed and there's a big battle that answers a few questions but raises more. Unfortunately, those questions aren't going to be answered anytime soon. I've read the manga, and at this point, I know that these mysteries are just going to be left unanswered until there's no way the answers we eventually get will be anything less than an anticlimax. I'd rate the manga a bit lower for that reason, but I guess in this first season there's still the hope that a second season will bring something resembling resolution to the series, so I'll account for that in the score. If all you're looking for is action or good production values, you'll probably enjoy it, and if you NEED to know about the biggest, most hyped shows around it's a must-watch. But if you're looking for something satisfying and conclusive with good characters, skip it. Three stars."}, {"id": 887, "score": 50, "body": "My view on this series basically boils down to this: many rehashed elements, not much substance. If you want to watch this just for the mecha aspect, it's pretty enjoyable due to the very high production values. If you're looking for a good story and solid characters to go along with that action, well, you might be disappointed. Unicorn builds upon previous Gundam series set in the Universal Century (UC) Timeline, so you shouldn't watch this until you've watched the UC Timeline's core content (0079, Zeta, CCA). And because Unicorn came out after those other Gundam series, I'll use some comparisons to highlight the places I feel Unicorn went wrong. There shouldn't be any spoilers for any series in the main review, just comments on the general direction of things. However, there is a spoiler section at the end that covers some things specific to Unicorn that I felt I needed to address. Despite the issues I have with this series, I would still recommend Gundam fans to watch it, especially since my opinion seems to be of the minority. Anyway, on with the rest of the review...\n\nStory:\nThe story of Unicorn starts off using a formula that has become very common for Gundam series. Basically, some event kicks off around the MC's home area, causing them to get pulled into a conflict. In 0079, Amuro was caught in a fight or flight situation within his home territory, and the same was true for Kira from Gundam Seed. Zeta Gundam was different in that Kamille put himself and others in harm's way due to his rebellious nature, rather than for some noble reason. I felt this was important to bring up, because it marks the difference in the MCs of the various series. Some start off just trying to survive or do the right thing, while others are displeased with the life they have. In Unicorn, things are a little weird. The main character, Banagher, starts off a bit like Kamille, in that he makes choices that pile up and result in him being pulled into a conflict. Although, unlike Kamille, it's almost as if Banagher's making an instinctual decision to be involved, since most of the time there's no reason for him to even care. It's like he realizes he's the main character of a show and is responsible for moving the plot forward. To make it even worse, he routinely blames other people for his continued involvement, even though he's given several chances to leave. That mentality gets old really fast.\n\nAs for the actual story-line, it follows the mystery of Laplace\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Box, which rumors say holds some great power. I really do mean rumors, since each side has almost no idea what the box is or where it's located. Yet, apparently, this rumor is important enough to basically revitalize a war over. Most of the story involves the various factions traveling place to place and fighting as some clue about the box's mystery is revealed. When the mystery behind the box is finally revealed, well, it's pretty underwhelming. It's hard to explain why I felt this way without spoiling anything, but essentially its significance is overplayed. There's some major logical missteps the writers made in trying to make the box seem important (see the spoilers sections if you want to know the specifics of what I mean). In reality, the infrastructure of where the box is located is actually more useful than the box itself. So once the box's secrets are revealed, some pretty important monologuing occurs, but it's not clear whether that amounts to anything. There's basically zero conclusion to the initial premise of the story, which is, \"War is bad, so stop killing each other all the time.\" Instead, the ending is essentially, \"Alright, cool, we found it, the end.\" All in all, the story is a real mess that seems completely lost and ends up amounting to nothing.\n\nCharacters:\nOverall, there's the same standard affair of characters as nearly every other entry in the UC timeline. I found this boring since the presence of some characters felt forced and only done to appeal to fans. Also, many characters have either no character development or very erratic changes in personality. I've already gone into a bit of detail about the MC and his actions in the beginning, but in terms of the entire series, he has almost no character development. As stated earlier, he likes to blame others for his problems. Kamille from Zeta did this, but it was a bit more reasonable since people were doing some pretty nasty things. Most importantly, Kamille's complaining decreases over time, and he becomes a person of action. Banagher, however, complains all the way from episode 1 to episode 7. In the end, he never seems to reach any real resolution with the actions he made, the actions of others, or why the whole mess started in the first place. Ultimately, he fulfills the strategic role of a Gundam pilot and not much else.\n\nAs for side characters, many of them also exhibit no character development. Now, character development is not always needed to make for a good show (see Baccano!), but there's a disturbing amount of still characters in Unicorn. Although, there was one character that seemed like they were trying to make up for this void by flipping personalities every couple of episodes. These changes came across as extreme and unsubstantiated reactions whenever they occurred. It was kind of like, \"Oh, I guess that happened.\" So, again, like the story, the characters are a mess.\n\nCombat:\nThis might seems like a strange category, but due to the core of the Gundam franchise being about mechas blowing each other up (IMO), I figured it was important to discuss this in detail. While past Gundam series have always had a decent case of what I'll call Dragonball Z Syndrome (i.e. talking in the middle of a fight), Unicorn has a near terminal case. The flow of combat is constantly interrupted by impromptu conversations held between pilots, even when they are enemies with each other. Although I'd make the argument that past series would be better if the flow wasn't interrupted as much as it was, it never got to the point where I was actively groaning that I hope they start fighting again.\n\nIn regards to combat strategy, this series basically has none. In past series, whatever factions the MCs belonged to would come up with strategies to win the battle. In other words, there was a good sense that these were somewhat realistic, strategic military battles. Unicorn's battles feel like poorly thought out skirmishes, where each side hopes that their fighters are stronger than the fighters on the other side. This is a little bit understandable since the scale of the conflict in Unicorn is smaller than the earlier series, but still, the faction leaders could at least put a little bit more effort into their combat plans.\n\nIn regards to the individual battles throughout the series, very few people are shown using any basic strategies. Mostly they rely on magical shields and flying pod lasers to fight and defend. I think a character used an asteroid as cover once in the entire series. It's really disappointing to see this as Gundam has a history of pilots making the best use of their environment in order to win. Instead the pilots use their mobile suits as nothing more than amplifiers for their pre-existing special abilities. This is a problem I've had with other Gundam series as well, where it feels more like a super-robot show rather than a real-robot show, but Unicorn is one of the worst offenders yet.\n\nExpanding a bit more on the pilots' abilities, people like Amuro and Kamille were decent pilots when they started out, but they weren't great. They basically had to rely on their natural talent, their usually OP mobile suit, and the support of other characters to get them through a battle. As time went on, they became very good pilots, and combined with their other abilities, they became extremely effective in battle. In Unicorn, this isn't what happens. Banagher can immediately pilot his mobile suit extremely well and there's almost no development in his fighting ability. So not only did the writers forget to develop his actual character, but they forgot to develop his physical and mental attributes as well!\n\nArt/Sound:\nGenerally speaking, it's all very good. The animation looks great, with the mobile suits being particularly well-done. The sound effects and BGM are also great. The art quality is basically the only thing that saved this series for me. So even though I found everything else sub-par, the battles are still fun to watch. \n\nVoice Acting:\nI watched the English dubbed version and the voice acting was quite good. Everyone's voices seemed to match up with their intended characters, and the performances themselves always matched up to what was happening on screen. In other words, no complaints here.\n\nConclusion:\nAs a whole, Unicorn really disappointed me. The visuals combined with it being set in the UC Timeline made me hope they would be doing something interesting. Instead, it was just a compilation of poorly re-imagined characters, the inclusion of elements that dragged past series down, and generally poor writing all-around.\n\nSpoiler Stuff :\nSeriously, don't read any of this unless you've seen the whole series.\n\n(***Spoilers***)\nNew-Type Stuff:\nThis connects to the disruption of combat mentioned above. While many other Gundam series have had the same out of body things occur during fights, none of them seemed to break up the action like Unicorn did for me. Also, very few people express shock when it happens. I know we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen it before in past series, and that the universe is probably used to new-types by now. But, I still think communicating telepathically or spiritually with another person would freak most people out.\n\nBanagher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s First Kill:\nBanagher doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know he has killed someone until he is told after the fact. He expresses shock, but then gets over it by the end of the scene. It seems kind of strange that it isn't ever brought up again in any detail given how much he complains about killing in general throughout the rest of the series.\n\nLaplace\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Box:\nThe location where it is found is actually more useful than the box itself, since the location has infrastructure that allows Mineva to talk to all of humanity at once in an attempt to change their mind on how to govern space people. Yet, there's no indication of whether it worked. There isn't even a single scene of the general public watching her broadcast. The two ship captains are also seen clearly ignoring what she is saying as they discuss getting drinks together. It's strange that the whole series revolves around each faction arguing about what the future should look like, and then no one listens when someone lectures them about it. Also, the extra article in the founding principles only holds importance if people want it to. The current government can just say, \"We didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sign that into law.\" Not to mention people have never operated under the belief something like that was ever true, so why should it hold so much weight all of a sudden? If something like that was important enough to the general public, they would have made it a law already. Clearly a large portion of people just flat out disagree that the space-noids should have more self-control, so it's not like some 100 year old slab is going to change their mind. The only truth is the one people choose to accept."}, {"id": 894, "score": 64, "body": "Well, I finished XW, the sixth installment of the Digimon Franchise and my review is:\n\nThe first part, where you introduce the important characters and their mons, that is between episode 1 until Nene joins the team (imo) is good, a throwback of the adventure franchise (and all the installments in general) through the power of the digimemories, the second part is a little bit more boring and you feel like it's going nowhere.\n\nBut Death Generals? That stuff was __TIGHT__. \n\nIt's not bad, it's kinda enjoyable, it screams more to Gurren Lagann than Digimon in some aspects, because evolution is in the latest arcs, and DigiXros is more used, also the difference between powers is little to not respected (Shoutmon is the core of the digicross, a rookie level digimon, can beat champions if he digixrossed and it was on the same level of power than Greymon who was Kiriha's core, an adult level).\n\nHowever it might become tedious at times (the second arc only is worth watching because Nene joins XH) and you think that some of Taiki's companions are useless, but all of them work together and that, as cliche as it sounds, is what makes Xros Heart good. Zenjirou and Akari don't have mons and you think they're useless at first, but you warm up to them. The characters themselves - well, they are good, but unlike Kiriha and maybe Nene if her past is revealed in Hunters, I didn't felt like Taiki's desire to help everybody - which makes him make ridiculous choices at times, was...relatable? No, none of them were relatable except Zenjirou or Akari or even Nene, but it felt like it wasn't good enough. Nevertheless, I love Taiki because I have a soft spot for main characters who are happy and like to help everyone.\n\nThe other generals of the teams (that join Taiki on their final  arc) are good, despite how people might think, Kiriha is not an expy of any rival ~~he is in fact more annoying than the rest of them~~, he reminded me more of Paul from Pokemon (Likewise, Taiki wasn't like Taichi despite the goggles - he is way more of an strategist than the other leaders are), and Nene was simply amazing despite her writing seemed a bit...off at times, especially on the last arc, other of the reasons why I loved Nene is because she was an older sister, which makes XW different to it's predecessors, where all the older siblings were male.\n\nIt takes a while to get good, but I say that if you haven't watched it, give it a chance. I'm not going to lie, I watched this (and will watch Hunters) because of the fanservice all gens crossover, liked it more than I thought I would - and I liked it more than Frontier, the fourth installment. \n\nNow...I suppose I'll go with Hunters."}, {"id": 907, "score": 55, "body": "___WARNING: THERE ARE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW, AND A LOT OF ME SWEARING AT PIERROT.___\nWelcome to my review of Naruto Shippuden. Studio Pierrot seems to love to take the piss a lot. Oh God, here we go.\n\n__Story: 6.5__\nThe story within Shippuden was great at first, we saw how Naruto struggled after his training with Akatsuki running after him, and how they screwed over other ninjas. We saw some great battles, and we got to see Naruto grow from that overly confident shouting child to someone more serious. We saw Pain in all of his glory, and the great story that unfolded.!Then the war happened, and if I'm going to be honest, the story started acting like an alcoholic. It swayed and swayed, and sometimes completely crashed, but eve ry once in awhile, it wou'ld regain its posture to only go back to puking. It seems that Kishimoto as many people said ran out of interesting ideas. There are some squeezed into the story, awkwardly standing in place with all this mediocre writing, like when Guy faced off against Madara. OH NO, WE CAN'T HAVE A SUPPORTING CHARACTER KILL THE MAIN BAD GUY, THAT'S STUPID, WE NEED NARUTO TO ASSUME AN EVEN GREATER FORM AND DRAG THE STORY OUT EVEN FURTHER THAN IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO. Most of the arcs before the war are great or good, watch them.\n\n__Visuals: 5__\nI think this is one of the main reasons why Pierrot is taking the piss. Now I know that there is a budget when you make an anime, and you don't want to spend past the assigned budget. BUT COULD AT LEAST SET A STANDARD STYLE OF ANIMATION YOU CAN GO BACK TO AFTER THE GREAT ANIMATION PLEASE. The animation in this show is varied so much, one arc could look like total turds, and then the next could be all glittery and nice. One of the best animated arcs was the Summit Arc, but some of the worst animation I've ever seen came from Pain V Kyuubi Naruto. It was all over the place, and some of it looked like children colored it. I have also noticed a lack of somewhat decent shading, and characters not moving at all for two minutes because one of the animators was a lazy pile of crap who didn't care. They sometimes use basic effects, they reuse flashbacks constantly, and when good animation does happen, you barely even notice since you stopped caring a while ago.\n\n__Sound: 7.5__\nThe voice actors for Shippuden are fine, I like them all. The problem I have is the music. The original Naruto had some pretty great tracks, and I would JAM to them. Shippuden reuses music so much to the point where I want to face desk until I'm mortally wounded. IS SOMETHING SUSPENSEFUL HAPPENING? PLAY THE \"SUSPENSEFUL SHIT IS HAPPENING\" TRACK FOR THE SEVEN HUNDREDTH TIME. The music is also quite simple and unmemorable at times, they are like forced down Lima beans. A lot of the opening and ending tracks are great, but there is one that is so bad. I am talking about Totsugeki Rock. Just, why? Why would you choose this song Pierrot?\n\n__Characters: 5.5__\nHonestly, everyone hates Sakura. SHE IS SO FUCKING USELESS. \"Naruto, I love you.\" FUCK OFF SAKURA AND DO SOMETHING WORTHWHILE. Sasuke is turned into a terrible character. \"Even though my brother saved the village and risked his life and spared mine, my hormones will command me to destroy Konoha and join Akatsuki! I'm so smart!\" GGGAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH I liked Jiraiya a lot, and the arc where Jiraiya dies will be one of my favorite arcs ever in Shippuden. I also liked Asuma, but he died, so shit. I also like the character of Shikamaru, but the war ruins his character for me. Gaara is a nice character, but he was only really developed in the original Naruto. Guy, now Guy, lemme tell ya, Guy is one of my favorite characters. I liked the story of his past, and GOD DAMN THAT FIGHT AGAINST MADARA.\nNaruto himself is greatly developed, but you see Kishimoto make him act stupid at times, which is frustrating. A FUCKING REVERSE HAREM, YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME KISHIMOTO, I'LL BREAK YOUR LEGS MAN.\n\n__Enjoyment: 3__\nAny enjoyment you had in watching this series will be bitch slapped away by filler. I want to see a CANON episode, but Pierrot is like, \"Enjoy this mediocre piece of shit filler episode!\" Madara just opened the Eternal Tsukiyomi, and we get SEVENTEEN WEEKS OF FUCKING FILLER. THIS IS WHY SO MANY PEOPLE DROPPED THIS SHOW, AND WHY I COULD EVEN GIVE LESS OF A SHIT ANYMORE. PIERROT IS TAKING THE PISS SO HARD. SO HARD. NO, I DON'T WANT TO WATCH SASUKE BE A PART OF THE FUCKING LEAF POLICE FORCE YOU PILES OF DONKEY SHIT. ANIMATE CANON EPISODES, THE MANGA HAS FUCKING ENDED.\n\n__Overall: 5.5__\nNaruto Shippuden is a show that was once good that was destroyed by uncreative writing, boring and unlikeable character s, constant streams of mediocre filler, overused music tracks, varying changes in animation and art, and peeks of good content slapped away by cliche and stupid writing by Kishimoto who just wanted to end the series. I do highly recommend watching up to the Summit Arc, and then switching over to the manga so you can end it faster. Also, watch Guy V Madara!, only thing you should watch during the war, even if cliche writing tarnished it a little."}, {"id": 918, "score": 55, "body": "The anime was a good watch, vibrant colours, nice animation, the style is refreshing and the opening song is SUPER catchy . It was not a bad anime but I would not say is a must watch. \n\nA lot of things made absolutely no sense and I expected them to be explained in the end, which never happened and that left me wondering if they even thought about what they were doing - or why they made such and such characters. At times it felt so random that it just seems for me that the anime had a weak plot and the staff had to randomly drop some ideas to make it seem like the plot was deeper, while in the end a lot of the secondary plot points introduced mostly in the beginning of the show ended up not mattering at all because of the greater plot introduced half-way. \n\nThe show had a lot of tone shifts, the comedic parts would sometimes come right after the more serious moments, making me have no time to have any feelings for what ever happened and making the seriousness of the plot rather a joke. I feel like they tried to make the show both dramatic, funny and ecchi all at once and what came out from that was a mess that made me have no reason to get invested in the anime whatsoever, it caused me to disconnect with the story and characters in such a way that if a character would die or if the planet would have exploded I would not care slightly. \n \nThe characters are forgetful, although not irritating they are also very blend, nothing I have not seen in hundreds of anime, not one character catches my attention and I feel nothing for the main character even with all the dramatic back story.\nThe music was OK, I had the opening song in my head for days, the ending is also nice, the OST worked well with the show's visuals.\n\nAll things considered though, I must say that it was a fun watch, the anime is just really well done art-wise, it is a shame that it lacked so much in the story department. \nI would recommend this anime for people seeking for an easy-going experience, the anime is rather short and is sure very vibrant.

Consequently, it may contain some light spoilers from those arcs.\n\nStardust Crusaders is by far the most iconic and well-known part of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, perhaps because it's the one that truly began to set the tone for all the parts to follow. However, being iconic doesn't necessarily mean it's the best. In a lot of ways, Stardust Crusaders takes one step forward, one step back, and two steps sideways.\n\nFirst, the biggest change from the previous two parts is the introduction of Stands. Stands are a unique variety of physical manifestations of fighting ability, usually taking the form of a humanoid. Basically, they're magic ghosts you use to punch people. These stands manifest in a variety of people (and animals) in a variety of ways. For example, while the protagonist Jotaro has a very straightforward Stand (i.e., it punches people), the Stands encountered in the series do a variety of things, from possessing people to attacking them through their dreams.\n\nIt's important to set this up now because Stands are vital to explaining the plot of Stardust Crusaders. The Stands only begin to manifest in the Joestar line due to Dio taking over Jonathan Joestar's body, and Jotaro's mother/Joseph's daughter begins to develop a Stand that is slowly killing her because she can't control it. As a result, Jotaro and Joseph are joined by three others (Avdol, Kakyoin, and Polnareff) as they journey to Egypt to defeat Dio.  From this point on, the show becomes a series of battles as this group of five, known as the Stardust Crusaders, encounter Stand user after Stand user interrupting their progress on their way to Egypt. The first part sees them fighting their way through all the tarot-based Stands (minus Dio) and ultimately arriving in Egypt.\n\nAs with the last season, the anime is very well produced, with fantastic art, good music, solid directing, and beautifully hammy voice acting. The introduction of Stands, however, brings a drastic shift in things. For example, Hamon is completely irrelevant, making only one appearance in this first half and failing to be of any use. While it's a shame to lose the magic system we've had for the previous two parts, it's kind of a necessity since Hamon is really only useful for fighting the undead, and having to constantly fall back on that limits the places the series can go. The drawback is that Hamon incorporated the user's entire body and took a lot of training and skill to use, whereas Stands seem to be innate and, until you see a lot of them in action and really start to grasp how exactly the Stands and users are linked, it seems like the Stands do all the fighting and render the users themselves completely irrelevant.\n\nThe introduction of Stands also allows for much more absurd fights. Yes, Battle Tendency may have had a Nazi cyborg, but the enemies in the first half of Stardust Crusaders includes an orangutan pedophile dressed in an admiral's outfit, an enraged car, and a genius baby. As a result, the series itself takes on a much sillier tone. The voice acting is blatantly over-the-top, which fits the new tone perfectly. Joseph added a bit of levity to Battle Tendency, but in Stardust Crusaders, his exaggerated yells and Engrish phrases instantly steal the scene, in the best way possible. On the flip side, because this arc doesn't take itself near as seriously, it also incorporates a lot more toilet humor. If the idea of our heroes feeding a baby its own poo, peeing in a man's mouth, or being forced to lick a toilet turns you off, well, you're probably not going to be considering this arc one of your favorites.\n\nIt's also worth noting that this arc fixes a major problem from the previous arcs. While Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency only really had one hero and consequently had to sideline everyone else and have them shout out commentary like they're sportscasters, Stardust Crusaders uses a team of capable people who all get their chances to shine.\n\nFinally, the pacing of this arc is absolutely terrible. It's a travel story, and while in some ways that makes it feel more epic, it also turns it into a very episodic show, with they fighting one stand per every episode or two episodes. Most of these fights end up being completely irrelevant. They don't cause character development and they don't advance the plot. All they do is provide another obstacle for the Stardust Crusaders to face. There's a reason why the two halves of this adaptation have a total of 48 episodes while the OVAs from 1993 and 2000 that cover the same arc are able to condense it to 13. While it's exciting when watched weekly, it becomes a pain to watch all in one go.\n\nDue to the two halves of this arc being divided into two different seasons, I'm going to have to rate them individually, and the first half is by far the weaker one. It's a few episodes of setup, followed by what is essentially a lot of filler. The episodes may be fun, but they're not as compelling as what came before or what will come in the second half of Stardust Crusaders. On top of that, it's incomplete, so it loses a few points when judging it on its own. Despite that, this season is able to set up the new direction the series starts to take in a satisfactory way, and while it's not the same as Phantom Blood or Battle Tendency, I think it's just about on par with them. In the end, it's just good, pure fun with absolutely no substance to it. But really, isn't that what you're watching JoJo for anyway?

This first season of the Slayers TV anime, however, delivers on both fronts, mixing the Rumiko Takahashi-ish comical shenanigans with a cohesive plot pitting Lina Inverse and company against the demon lord, Shabranigdo, among other villains. This first season is much slower and more relaxed than later ones, which makes it a bit less entertaining to watch, but it gets from point A to point B with a few amusing pit stops along the way, and ends with a satisfying conclusion to the overarching plot.\n\n__Art:__ Being an older series, it should be no surprise that the art is a bit dated.

The two leads, Lina and Gourry, get off to a slightly rocky start but grow into their roles nicely as time goes on. Other characters change their voice actors completely partway through the season (both for the better), while others still are just stuck with their mediocre voices beginning to barely-audible end (Rezo). Though an average dub for the time, it sadly does not hold up today. On the music front, Slayers hits it home with a recognizable soundtrack that boasts a distinct style, setting the pace for the rest of the series to follow.\n\n...\n\nSlayers is a classic series that should be on the watchlist of any dedicated anime fan looking for the complete, historical anime experience. Like many of its classic acquaintances, it's not the best show by modern standards, but it's still a fun ride from beginning to end, and the first stepping stone in what will become a strongly-written series with some great characters and a lot of fun to be had... but that's not 'til later seasons."}, {"id": 968, "score": 55, "body": "Kanojo x Kanojo x Kanojo is probably my favorite hentai series and one of the few that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ever stood out to me. That said, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still hentai. While target demographic and purpose is definitely an important factor in judging a show, that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t excuse its flaws. How well does it hold up when held to an objective standard?\n\nThe setup for Kano3 is simple and flimsy, but believable. Haruomi Shiki, a high school student, begins living with the three Orifushi sisters, his childhood friends. Why? The anime doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t elaborate beyond saying it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor various reasons.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The visual novel appears to open with a volcanic explosion, so perhaps his home was destroyed. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not entirely certain, as I am not fluent in moonspeak and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not reviewing the visual novel anyway. The Orifushi parents are \u00e2\u0080\u009clong gone\u00e2\u0080\u009d (presumably dead), so there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no family to get in the way. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to cast a critical eye on all this and say \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is all just a plot device to set up the porn,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also hard to condemn for this. After all, at least one of the sisters is old enough to be a legal guardian, they have a source of income, and while \u00e2\u0080\u009cvarious reasons\u00e2\u0080\u009d isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly an enlightening excuse as to why Haroumi is moving in with three young women he hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen in a while, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not exactly an excuse you can poke holes in either. Besides, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching this, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re probably not looking for a detailed backstory. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to know how the parents died or how the sisters managed afterwards, and you actually probably don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to.\n\nWhat excuse there is for a plot is about ice cream. Haruomi helps the sisters reinvigorate their struggling ice cream shop as a major chain makes plans to move in nearby. Again, you probably don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care much about the plot if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching this. Most of the show is character-driven slice-of-life anyway, so a sparse plot is all that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s needed.  The slice-of-life segments are actually fairly decent. They often feature good comedic timing, especially in how they execute the art shifts into the chibi style.\n\nThe characters are probably the strongest point of Kano3, which is good because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re what drive it. Jin Happoubi, original artist and character designer, excels at crafting beautiful and engaging characters.\n\nAkina Orifushi, middle sister, is the archetypal pink-haired \u00e2\u0080\u009cmain girl.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind, sweet, and cheerful, but also a bit na\u00c3\u00afve and easily flustered. Natsumi Orifushi, the oldest sister, is your large-breasted onee-chan. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cheerful and easygoing, a bit spacey, and perhaps a bit more sexually aggressive than the other characters. The youngest sister, Mafuyu Orifushi, is objectively the best girl. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a stoic and mischievous bookworm who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very sexually curious and likes playing at dominating despite her inexperience. In addition to the three sisters, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Midori Byakudan, the uptight president of Haruomi and Akina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s class, and her shy best friend, Suzuran Himenohara.\n\nThe characters all have easily identifiable personalities and are the sorts of characters I think could carry an anime even if it weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for the porn. Suzu is the only real miss for me, and I found Mafuyu lovable enough that I consider her mai waifu. Seriously. I own a dakimakura.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the series is, admittedly, not particularly impressive. The animation is cheap, the music is simple and not particularly consistent, and overall everything falls short of what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d expect of even a lower-budget TV anime series. However, it is much better than a lot of the hentai I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen. While it does contain looped animation, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s used much more sparingly than in some other hentai, and some of it is hidden or kept interesting through camera pans or altering the speed. There are some minor continuity errors regarding what characters are wearing during sex scenes, but not nearly as bad as some examples I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen and you really have to be watching that to notice them. The most egregious production failing is by far when a 4 \u00c2\u00bd minute sex scene at the end of episode 2 is lazily repeated wholesale at the beginning of episode 3. This appears not to have been the original plan, since both the third part of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cComplete Edition\u00e2\u0080\u009d (a release featuring all 3 episodes strung together into one) and the leaked uncensored version of episode 3 feature a different opening scene, as well as including a brief fellatio scene with Midori that is almost entirely cut in the original release. In fact, much of the third episode feels lackluster or low-budget, as if time, money, or both just weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there.\n\nMuch of the soundtrack is generic or doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite fit, but the rest of the sound design is actually fairly strong. The sound effects used in the comedic moments are able to add to the jokes, and quiet moments will often include buzzing cicadas. At the very least, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at least some sense of atmosphere and the world doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel dead and empty.\n\nAnd now we come to the sex scenes.\n\nIt should be noted that Kano3, while not entirely vanilla, feels like it is. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no futa, no rape, no scat, etc. There are some scenes that push the line a bit, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re usually softened. While there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a brief scene of peeing, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brief, random, and not actually part of a sex scene. One scene contains a threesome. While the Orifushi sisters do not all attempt to have sex with Haruomi at the same time, they do show up together in a state of undress to take their turn with him, so there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a moment that borders on incest. And Mafuyu does engage in some light domination with Haruomi, at one point tying his hands, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s offset a bit by the fact that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presented largely as curious and inexperienced. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for monogamy, though, this one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably not for you.\n\nThe characters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 motivations for the sex don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel too forced or random. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not much more than an explanation to allow the plot to move from sex scene to sex scene with some sense of fluidity, but at least there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at least some chemistry to most of the relationships. The Orifushi sisters all have a prior relationship with him, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s understandable that they would reconnect on a new level. Midori\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary attraction seems to be to Suzu, so their initial sex scene is more just her trying to pull Haruomi away from her friend. Suzu, again, is the one that falls a bit more flat. She just seems to be constantly horny just because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s her nature.\n\nThe quality of the scenes does vary some, though much of that is going to depend on tastes and fetishes. Episode 3 does seem to be notably lackluster in terms of scenes, and like I mentioned, the animation in that episode seems to take a hit as well, but that's the only one with an uncensored leak. Personally, I found Mafuyu's first two scenes and the threesome with Midori and Suzu to be the most enjoyable. Maybe you'll prefer other scenes. Maybe you're into more hardcore stuff and none of these will appeal to you. I don't know what you like to whack it to, and I don't really care to.\n\nOverall, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a light-hearted hentai with fun characters that will entertain you enough to hold your attention through more than just the sex scenes, which is all you can really ask of hentai. Without the sex scenes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not necessarily a particularly engaging series, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enough of value there that you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily feel like you were wasting your time. As a hentai, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head and shoulders above a lot of stuff out there, and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t contain much to turn viewers off as well. It's one that I've personally found myself returning to frequently. Maybe you'll feel the same way."}, {"id": 970, "score": 68, "body": "Memories is a series of movies released in 1995, consisting of three different short stories that actually don't really have an underlying theme among them. As such, they are of inconsistent quality and execution, though one thing remains in all of them - the spectacular animation.\n\nKatsuhiro Otomo is known for Akira, plain and simple, regarded as one of (if not the) best animated anime to date. But he's not the only one behind this production, which also has Yoko Kanno (known for her work in Cowboy Bebop and Ghost in the Shell) and Satoshi Kon (one of the most visually creative directors anime has had). Given the A team involved, it's almost a given how good Memories is supposed to be. However, as the three short movies are very different, they need to be talked about separately.\n\n~~~<img width=480 src=http://i.imgur.com/kJZQgBx.png/>~~~\n\nMagnetic Rose is the first movie and the one on which the title \"Memories\" fits the most. A story about regret and escapism shot in space, it has impressive use of holograms and machinery to create a world born of nostalgia and denial of tragedy. Being set in space, one thing in particular that's very impressive is how natural movements feel when it comes to gravity - whether there's none, little, or full. Story and theme-wise, it is the strongest film in the bundle.\n\n~~~<img width=480 src=http://i.imgur.com/189XyjN.png/>~~~\n\nStink Bomb is, well, a stink. Early on one can know, from the use of the soundtrack, that this is primarily a comedy, and as one, it just isn't funny. While the protagonist is nonchalantly trying to do what he thinks is his job, everyone around him scrambles as fast as they can in order to survive, or even outright try to kill him. It remains just as strong in the visual front - the amount of movement in particular is of note, with several soldiers and citizens in one frame moving at the same, several explosions happening at once, and a small motorbike making its way through all that. The gas visuals are also impressive.\n\n~~~<img width=480 src=http://i.imgur.com/eAMlJka.png/>~~~\n\nCannon Fodder is the most visually impressive of the bunch. I didn't double check, but I wouldn't be surprised if there were less than five 'hard cuts' in this film. The 'camera''s perspective is moving at almost all times, with an incredible range of movement from the foreground and background at the same time. It leads to an unfortunate side effect once or twice of the foreground and background feeling like two different cells altogether, one stacked on top of the other, but it happens so little (and it's so impressively looking otherwise) that it's easily forgivable. The art style is also very different from the other movies, having a more rough drawing style, with lots of lines. Many times it felt like an in-game shot cutscene, complete with first person perspective. Amazing stuff.\n\nAs a whole product, Memories feels sort of disjointed. There are some incredible visual strengths at play in all entries, but very little story in most, with only Magnetic Rose really having a noticeable effort in that regard. There doesn't seem to be an underlying purpose for all of these to be packaged together other than being a showcase of the staff's talents, and so, one entry being weak unfortunately affects the whole thing. While Magnetic Rose and Cannon Fodder can stand by themselves as great anime movies, Stink Bomb brings the whole thing down one or two notches, despite still being visually impressive. If you're a fan of animation and direction, you owe yourself to watch this one - even if Stink Bomb sours it a bit."}, {"id": 972, "score": 59, "body": "Tsugou no Yoi Sexfriend is a 4 episode series of OVAs that follows main character [Yuu Arahama](http://anilist.co/character/89591/YuuArahama) as he lets his 5 sex friends know that they're not his only sex friend.

The series ends without much changing except Yuu's sex friends are now aware of each other and are more open to the idea of sharing their partner.\n\nThe OVAs manage to keep reminding the viewer about the overall plot but the lack of development makes the series rather uninteresting. Additionally some scenes feel a bit rushed as the series struggles to maintain a consistent pace.\n\n## Animation                   <span class=\"feed__tags\"> 12 / 20 </span>\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n<div class=\"activity__type-btns\"> <a>  \n    <i class=\"material-icons\"> done </i> Quality\n  </a>  <a>\n    <i class=\"material-icons\"> done </i> Consistency  \n  </a>  <a>\n    <i class=\"material-icons\"> clear </i> Fluidity\n  </a>  <a>\n    <i class=\"material-icons\"> done </i> Avoids Reusing Scenes\n  </a>  <a>\n    <i class=\"material-icons\"> clear </i> Avoids Looping Scenes\n  </a></div>\n\nThe animation was fairly enjoyable to look at for the most part with the characters and scenery looking rather pleasing. There were plenty of different settings throughout the series so each scene felt unique instead of reused and boring.\n\nThe downfall is that most scenes ended up just being pans across the same animation loop with two or three camera changes. If you were lucky there was a change in the loop but the climax scenes ended up being sped up versions of the loop.\n\n## Sound                       <span class=\"feed__tags\"> 6 / 15 </span>\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n<div class=\"activity__type-btns\"> <a>  \n    <i class=\"material-icons\"> clear </i> Good OP / ED\n  </a>  <a>\n    <i class=\"material-icons\"> done </i> Fits In  \n  </a>  <a>\n    <i class=\"material-icons\"> clear </i> Memorable\n  </a>  <a>\n    <i class=\"material-icons\"> done </i> Good Character CVs\n  </a>  <a>\n    <i class=\"material-icons\"> clear </i> Realistic\n  </a></div>\n\nThe series doesn't ever start with an opening but the end credits do give a summary of the scenes with some out of place electronic music playing in the background. Other than that all of the audio fits in rather well with the scenes so you don't really even think about it.\n\nThe CVs do a fine job of fitting their character's archetype appropriately. The only issue is that scenes do end up being a bit of a scream-fest, but that's not a major issue for me that'd ruin a scene.\n\n## Enjoyment                   <span class=\"feed__tags\"> 18 / 20 </span>\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n><i class=\"material-icons\"> star </i><i class=\"material-icons\"> star </i><i class=\"material-icons\"> star </i><i class=\"material-icons\"> star </i><i class=\"material-icons\"> star_half </i>\n\nLike I mentioned before, I didn't really care for most of the girls but Kotori and Makiko's scenes were both enjoyable.

And it's not too difficult to notice why: an attractive mix of a __murder mystery__, a dynamic __time-travel concept __and a __gripping thriller__ would move anyone out of their caves. Curiously, and despite the various shortcomings, this experimental bag of genres works pretty well during the first quarter of the series, __leaving a a lot of engagement that is presented in a very organic style__. However, after the show reaches its mid-point, all the positive aspects slowly vanishes as the characters grow quite stale, the pacing of the mystery starts going in circles and a conclusion that leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nErased story goes around the struggles of __Satoru,__ your average part-time worker and mangaka that for a long time has had an occasional ability (which he calls '_Revival_') that permits him to go back in time; normally to fix some problem present on his surroundings. Needless to say, this time-travel element can awake a lot of qualms on most viewers that actually know how inconsistent and convoluted a story can turn when said element is misused to the point of breaking the plausibility or even contradicting some logic of the time-related aspect. Fortunately, this never happens...with the time-travel aspect. Meaning, that this part of the show is simply a gimmick employed to add some attractive aesthetic, thing that works well if not over-analyzed. __There is a huge amount of convenience that comes from this aspect, though__.\n\nThe plot begins when the mother of the main character (Satoru) getting killed by a mysterious serial murderer, and after a lot of silly coincidences Satoru ends up escaping from the police...only to be taken back in time by the 'Revival'. But, instead of the small amount of time which he usually travels, now he moved almost 20 years backwards! Then, at that past timeline, he begins to think that his mother murderer can be related to the death of his old schoolmate __Kayo__, that curiously happened during the week he has just been send to.\n\nThe most positive aspect of the series during its starting episodes is obviously __the achieved atmosphere__. When you know the MC has to rescue a girl from an imminent death, you would expect a good amount of tension and character perseverance; two things that the show incorporates splendidly. The constant snowfalls, the silent and potentially dangerous nights, a group of children that act so innocently. All this characteristics, though seemingly details, _form a very solid amount of engagement to the series_. I couldn't stop watching the first 4 episodes, everything related to the presentation was extremely well-polished. Also, when you truly can't tell who the real murderer is, it all turns very gripping.\n\nStill, problems are present on this part. Depending on how much attention you pay to the show, some flaws can be easily noticeable and thus quite annoying: like the fact that Satoru goes back in time with a body of a child but __in reality he still has a mind of a mid-20s year old.__ To make it worse, this little problem gets a huge amount of emphasis because of the repetitive internal monologues that Satoru tells with his 20-year old mind, that also happens (mostly) during events he's in a serious or heartwarming moment with Kayo, unfortunately breaking the immersion and it even can encourage a very inappropriate romantic tension for some. Whether some other flaws (like the unnecessary victimizing) can be noticeable, it depends on what mindset you're on while watching Erased. But, generally, they're not _too_ damaging.\n\nAn despite the various cool aspects of its first episodes, those don't endure too much. After reaching the mid-point, the time-travel aspect comes out again to produce some conveniences that ruin the enjoyable pacing the plot was having at the moment. With that, is added a disappointing amount of __predictability__ to the mystery, just making the culprit more or less obvious before the last episodes. This happens because of a constant repetition of events that goes like a _'I have to save them all!'_ premise. Instead of going to the point of the matter, the show cares too much about including an __incommensurable amount of stupid drama, focusing on showing pity and shame instead of actual character struggle__. In other words: it goes in circles with the same basic objective, even after it is fulfilled. To take it all down, the various revelations and even the ending ended up dumb because of these flaws.\n\nWhat makes the entire experience even more disappointing are __the very superficial attempts to develop some themes that are mainly about the family or the loss__. While having a decent mount of drama to keep you in touch with the events, the cruelty of some adults and the reasons behind the killings feel too basic and distant to actually care about them. It basically develops from an intriguing mystery to a revelation with a level of simplicity that speechlessly treats you as a child in kinder garden. For example: It's later revealed that Kayo's mother hits her child because she suffered of the same trauma before, thing that never delves into a deeper perspective or insight.\n\nAnd, also, don't forget about the Drama tag on the genres description...__which leads us to the characters section__!\n\n__Satoru__ is basically, as I wrote before, an average adult male that after a lot of moving events is forced (or motivated) to save Kayo in order to also save his mom. He's not a particularly relatable character, as his often altruistic nature feels more heroic rather than human. __Kayo__ is a kuudere girl that's often hit by her mother, thus gaining the mentioned personality. She's the only character that gains some development, as she changes her personality to a more optimistic and caring side. __Kenya __is the typical cool blonde-haired guy that helps the main character to fulfill his goal. And __Airi __is a secondary love interest of Satoru that has very little screentime to care about. As you see, the cast of characters, though generally bearable, lack of enough depth to fill the gaps made by the tremendous amount of drama that's simply too overblown and excessive.\n\nAbout the production values, they're quite good. __A-1 Pictures __(Sword Art Online, AnoHana, Shin Sekai Yori) normally possesses good budgets, so the animation and art of Erased were certainly very nice. The color palette was leaning towards the cold, white and bright tones, well-fitting with the snowfalls and most of the characters personalities. The character design, for some reason, can be described as innocent: with different eyes drawings but the same childish and soft face design and shape. It's clearly not the kind of anime that focus on severe moments or big explosions, so the animation is just fluid for what it is. __A very well presented show on this aspect.__\n\n__The sound is not particularly good__, though. Most tracks are just repetitions of the ED theme (which is O.K.) in different instruments and pitches. Maybe some piano solos are the only moments Erased uses some variety. The OP theme, on the other hand, is quite likable. It's yet another song with catchy one-line phrases that only change its lyrics accompanied with another catchy main chorus; but it's still nice to hear, specially once the show reaches its worst parts. The seiyuu was solid but nothing too special. __Average performance on this aspect__.\n\n__Erased was a show that consumed my patience after it became too dumb for me to give a crap about it__. Some interesting themes were going on, like family drama and other stuff, but the approach to it is just plain superficial and forgettable. About its current popularity, it's just a ridiculous fad that will fade away in some months, after another show takes its place (shame on modern viewers, really).\n\n__To sum it up, Erased is, more or less, a mess. Nothing particularly works out because of the basic characters, the mystery that unravels in a very stupid way and the forgettable finale. The interesting themes were taken down by the awful dramatic moments, and the soundtrack feels too recycled apart from particular piano tracks. If you are searching for a truly coherent and enjoyable time-travel anime that has believable drama and an extremely likable cast, stick to Steins;Gate. 'Erased' has just as much forgettable value as its name could allude to you.__"}, {"id": 981, "score": 60, "body": "~~~__The Artistry of Miyazaki__~~~\n~~~img320(https://40.media.tumblr.com/7581a631e12a987c122cb9d221136eca/tumblr_o57j2leSSr1vqic7go3_500.jpg)~~~\n\nChase scenes, guns, explosions, villains and a damsel in distress; all of which we have come to familiarize with when it comes to some action-packed adventures like James Bond and Indiana Jones. Lupin III: Castle of Cagliostro is exactly that, but it sets itself astray from its established set of characters, choosing to portray Lupin and his gang in a more heroic and less mature way. Does that mean that this film is bad? No, because it was given the touch of a maestro and it further introduced us to the artistry of Hayao Miyazaki.\n\n<hr style=\"height:3px; border:none; color:rgb(60,90,180); background-color:rgb(60,90,180);\">\n\n__Story:__\nThe story starts off with Lupin and Jigen doing what they do best, stealing. This time, they successfully rob a casino of all its money, only to later find out that what they had stolen is counterfeit money. Lupin and Jigen then head to the Grand Duchy of Cagliostro in an attempt to track down the counterfeiter and steal the legendary treasure that lies within the Castle of Cagliostro. On the way to the castle, Lupin and Jigen get involved in a car chase where in they save a a girl named Clarisse. Clarisse however, gets taken away and awhile later in the castle, Lupin finds the damsel in distress which he had saved earlier. This time, Lupin fails to rescue her. Lupin's failure leaves him with the decision to be a hero and save Clarisse from the clutches of the evil Count, but Zenigata and the police are hot on his trail and know where he is.\n\n~~~img320(https://49.media.tumblr.com/0cd7c7ea590b3adebb93f4dcb470f99c/tumblr_o57j2leSSr1vqic7go1_400.gif)~~~\n\nWhilst the story may seem average and basic, it is well crafted and well paced. Its careful pace helps in the various tone shifts that occur and the story never seems to drag. It always feels like it's engaging the viewers in the action-packed adventure which is what makes it enjoyable. Despite it being action-packed, there are moments of brief silence when the camera just pans over the scenery giving us a momentary break and breath of refreshment. The film also does a good job in terms of audience perspective, using deceit to hide the hints of foreshadowing which can only be seen if you observe carefully.\n\n<hr style=\"height:3px; border:none; color:rgb(60,90,180); background-color:rgb(60,90,180);\">\n\n__Art and Animation:__\nWith its western-cartoonish style and physic-defying scenes, some may not like the visuals because of its simplicity, but that is what makes it timeless. Going for a more light-hearted tone, the visuals were actually quite ahead of time. Production time, however, was only 7 months and 4 months were spent on the animation process! An incredible amount of attention went into the animation process. Castle of Cagliostro makes for an artistically inspiring film, using distinct camera angles, brilliant individual moments, dynamic display of motions and incredible sceneries. There's a castle and flying machines which would later become prominent in later Miyazaki films and heck, even the cars were carefully chosen. \n\n~~~img320(https://49.media.tumblr.com/7e7b7680bf1094de40304f9e35e2b294/tumblr_o57j2leSSr1vqic7go5_400.gif)~~~\n\nThe most iconic scene in the film is without a doubt, the car chase. It captures the emotions of the characters and the movement of the cars so well that it adds a sense of realism. It is as if the film is telling us to buckle up cause it's gonna be one heck of a ride. There are physic-defying moments throughout the film and for the car chase, going up and down the hill is one of them. But the cars become extensions of the characters' movements which is why it feels so engaging and real. The same can be said for other physic-defying moments in this film. They are not meant to be taken seriously but meant to be engaging and fun. Throughout the car chase, bits and pieces of the cars also fall apart as they navigate and turn through the roads, making use of perspective and distinct camera angles. It's incredible how they managed to do all this in just 4 months considering that vehicles alone, are hard to animate because you need to know the mechanics and how they work. And the castle, incredible as well. The castle feels immense just as it is supposed to be. It makes for an amazing setting, making good use of space which gives it the believability factor.\n\n<hr style=\"height:3px; border:none; color:rgb(60,90,180); background-color:rgb(60,90,180);\">\n\n__Sound and Music:__\nNothing much to say here. From jazzy tunes to soft and mellow ones, the music in the film was nothing short of good, perhaps Yuji Ohno's best. It just simply fits well with the narrative and art.\n\n~~~img320(https://45.media.tumblr.com/7202a5767818d2e9435e8f2dfa551949/tumblr_o57j2leSSr1vqic7go4_400.gif)~~~\n\n<hr style=\"height:3px; border:none; color:rgb(60,90,180); background-color:rgb(60,90,180);\">\n\n__Characters:__\nCastle of Cagliostro did not get a a good reception from fans of the original series because compared to this adaption, the original characters in Lupin III were quite mature. This is not the perfect introduction to the Lupin III franchise, but it does give a general overview of the characters and adds an extra dimension to them that other adaptions do not have. Lupin as a master thief, Jigen as a sharpshooter, Zenigata as a detective who is constantly chasing down Lupin, Goemon as a badass samurai, and Fujiko as a cat burglar.\n\n~~~img320(https://45.media.tumblr.com/342ebc7b67d3d77f89959fcd176c58a7/tumblr_o57j2leSSr1vqic7go2_400.gif)~~~\n\nThe thing with all the characters in this film is that they are meant to be basic as to make them likable to the audience. With this type of film, you are not supposed to see much complexity. You are just simply meant to enjoy it. Lupin is portrayed as a sort of \"Knight in Shining Armor\", while Clarisse is the damsel in distress and the Count is the evil villain. Sure they're basic archetypes, but Clarisse and the Count both have an aspect to them that can later be seen in later Miyazaki films. Take a look at the Count's character and you can see a hint of Colonel Muska from Laputa: Castle in the Sky. They are both suave and cunning. Now take a look at Clarisse who has a gutsy attitude. It's the  type of character that you can see in the likes of Nausica\u00c3\u00a4 from Nausica\u00c3\u00a4 of the Valley of the Wind and San from Princess Mononoke"}, {"id": 984, "score": 50, "body": "<div align=\"justify\">You know how, after a while, it feels as if certain genres and subgenres of anime \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or any medium for that matter \u00e2\u0080\u0093 become parodies of themselves? Whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the super-dramatic, super-scaled mecha adventure, the fan service-ripe, godforsaken high school harem rom-com or the tried and true, bombastic, never-ending battle shounen, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sad that with seeming inevitability, anime eventually become victim to their own tropes and clich\u00c3\u00a9s.  \n\nThe fantasy genre, and more specifically the isekai/\u00e2\u0080\u0098trapped in a fantasy world\u00e2\u0080\u0099 subgenre, is no exception. In recent years we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been treated to a plethora of shows where the dark, edgy protagonist has flexed his muscles and, with the aid of his unrivalled intellect and the immutable power of love, has overcome whatever obstacles, villains or beasties the world has thrown at them, virtual or otherwise. And as much as we enjoy watching teen nerdboy wish fulfilment, I think I speak for a lot of people when I say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gotten old, fast. \n\nEnter _Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash_.\n\n~~~img480(http://www.gamingilluminaughty.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/d907a5b56b7b29c30b73bd821100a3a4.png)~~~\n\nAdapted from a light novel series and coming out of [A-1 Studios](http://anilist.co/studio/561/A-1Pictures), it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a familiar scenario. Our hero, Haruhiro, awakes in a fantasy world with no recollection of his past life, though it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear that he came from the modern world. In order to make a living, he is forced to band together with a group of other misfits and slay monsters for loot. \n\nBeen there done that, right?\n\nExcept, despite its similarities with other titles in the transported-to-another-world genre, _Grimgar_ has one simple yet fundamental difference. \n\nIt asks the question: what if __real__ people were placed in this scenario? How would actual people, totally unaccustomed to such an archaic, savage lifestyle, act and fare if they were thrust into a world where the rules are literally kill or be killed?\n\n~~~img480(http://i.imgur.com/uU3PGek.jpg)~~~\n\nThe result is perhaps one of the most refreshing takes on fantasy-action anime in recent years. Instead of the usual overpowered heroes we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve become accustomed to, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re treated to a range of unique individuals, scared, desperate and somewhat incompetent, but still willing to do whatever it takes to survive. \n\nAs such, the series isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so much a plot driven action-adventure series as it is a character drama. There is no apparent goal, no evil villain and no way to escape. Instead, our unlikely band of heroes can only learn how to survive and grow and adapt with only each other to rely on.  \n\nAs its originality is undoubtedly _Grimgar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s_ greatest strength, by natural extension you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d think that its unique focus on character growth and development is one as well. And it is, for the most part.\n\n~~~img480(https://theglorioblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/grimgar71.png?w=700&h=394)~~~\n\nAll the main cast grow. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re forced to, given the gruelling situation they find themselves in. Most of this occurs through character interactions and how they differ over time. In other words, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of dialogue. And yet, said dialogue rarely becomes burdensome or boring. In fact, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s by far the most gripping aspect of the show. As the group are forced to endure mounting hardships, the individual members respond in a range of different manners. Tensions flare and tears are shed. And ultimately, it all feels so organic, so natural and so very real.\n\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because most of the cast are really quite authentic. Each has their own traits, their own strengths and their own flaws, with a particular emphasis on these flaws and how the cast climatically confronts and overcomes them.\n\n~~~img480(https://theglorioblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/grimgar45_6.png?w=700&h=394)~~~\n\nHowever, majority of the screen time was on the two principal characters. And by majority, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m talking the vast majority. Whilst the rest of the cast certainly have personality, they are nowhere as nearly developed as our primary two. In fact, it was almost disconcerting how, considering how nuanced and well-rounded Haruhiro is, a couple of the main crew are restricted to having only one or two defining character traits. \n\nThis is partially due to pacing. _Grimgar_ is a slow burner. Like, slower than that old lady driving in the fast lane slow. \n\nOn one hand, this is undoubtedly a good thing. Not only does it set the series apart from the usual breakneck pacing of fantasy adventure titles, but it pays dividends in allowing the characters to interact and mature at an organic rate.\n\n~~~img480(https://choraltempest.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/horriblesubs-hai-to-gensou-no-grimgar-02-720p-mkv_snapshot_03-33_2016-01-21_20-55-13.jpg?w=584)~~~\n\nOn the other hand, _Grimgar_ can get __distractingly__ slow. Initially, this wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t an issue for me. Sure, it takes a while before things start rolling, but I found the lackadaisical pacing to be endearing and refreshing as opposed to irritating. However as the series progresses it becomes painfully obvious how little is actually happening at times. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as if the show became so consumed by its own lethargy that it decided to hit the pause button on a few occasions. When it literally takes a character half an episode to get out of bed and walk to a caf\u00c3\u00a9, any and all charm is spontaneously replaced with frustration-inducing nausea. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perfectly acceptable for a series to progress gradually, but when time that could have been spent further developing secondary cast members, world building or the likes is wasted on __absolutely nothing__, it becomes burdensome and obnoxious. \n\nA large portion of the pacing issue can be attributed to the obscene number of self-contained tropes _Grimgar_ creates for itself. The irony is almost painful in this respect, where a title that distinguishes itself by defying genre tropes is victim to its own quirky but tedious meta. A ridiculous amount of time is spent on montages, tonally conflicting fan service, insert songs, cooking segments, freeze frames, circular introspection - you get the idea. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perplexing how this actually happened, and again detracts way too much time that could have been spent more productively.\n\n~~~img480(https://45.media.tumblr.com/c47d5179769da2ce8a90521f632206a6/tumblr_o0r1r9h1R71rd6sdio1_540.gif)~~~\n\nFor a fantasy title, surprisingly little attention is given to world building. Now as a huge fantasy/sci-fi fanboy, I personally would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve preferred some more exploration of what seems to be a rather typical medieval setting, though it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the be all and end all. What _Grimgar_ does achieve, however, is a seamless integration of thematic weight into the world surrounding Haruhiro and co. _Grimgar_ deals with some heavy subject matter, often verging on melodrama, and the emotional impact and weight of these themes is almost palpable in the various scenarios the cast encounter. As per its title, _Grimgar_ encompasses both the wondrous implications of _fantasy_ as well as the more sombre, morose ones of _ash_, with one element never quite overshadowing the other. Also, the action sequences are deliciously gritty. \n\nVisually, the series is very hit or miss. The watercolour backgrounds, which are undeniably gorgeous and also help invoke the whimsical, fantasy feel of the series, eventually become somewhat stagnant and repetitive. It was clear there were budget difficulties, with frequent dips in art quality, extended freeze frames and some rather hilarious animation hiccups. Character designs were okay for the most part.\n\n~~~img450(https://rosecoloredanime.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/grimgar-of-fantasy-and-ash-ep12-3.png)           img450(https://rosecoloredanime.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/grimgar-of-fantasy-and-ash-ep12-9.png)~~~\n\nMusic was pretty cool. Once again, I emphasise the prevalence of insert songs \u00e2\u0080\u0093 apparently one of the major sponsors was a music label. The OST, if a bit generic, is dominated by rock tracks and is pretty much exclusively performed by the band (K)NoW_NAME, just like the OP << Knew Day >> which I personally enjoyed a lot. The ED << Harvest >> is comparatively tenderer. \n\n~~~youtube(VCMn1a-WsM4)~~~\n\n_Grimgar_ is a satisfying series. It handles itself with maturity and distinction, and is a welcome and refreshing addition to the fantasy genre. And yet, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but feel that it falls half way. So much is left unrealised, so much screen-time is wasted and so much of its maturity is needlessly subverted. And while _Grimgar of Fantasy of Ash_ was a solid start to the 2016 anime calendar, it could and should have been so much more."}, {"id": 998, "score": 60, "body": "Disappointment is a common feeling when observing something that you have high or even mild expectations for. As one gets older, I believe that many individuals learn to dampen expectations, in all areas of life. But that does not mean we are immune to being disappointed in something all over again. For myself, _Ajin_ is one scenario of disappointment. A show that had an interesting premise and manga background, being created by Polygun Studios whose_ Knights of Sidiona_ was a mild surprise for me. But in the ways that Knights succeeded, Ajin has stumbled on itself repeatedly turning my viewing of the show into one of a burden rather then one of anticipation.\n\nAjin tells the story of a boy, Nagai Kei, who finds out he is a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdemi-human\u00e2\u0080\u009d or Ajin. These demi-humans are essentially individuals that appear to be immortal, while possessing a handful of abilities. Within the journey of the show, we are treated to Kei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transition from overwhelmed teenager with powers, to an ajin who has some slight control of his new self.\n\nHowever, Kei is an emotionally amoral and selfish person, who is only concerned with being a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood human\u00e2\u0080\u009d. This becomes problematic for the show as it attempts to weave a story of three parties: Satou an Ajin who wants to start a war, the government and private companies that want to profit from brutal Ajin experiments, and Kei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quest to be left alone. There are a handful of other side characters in the show, but they disappear so quickly it feels as though they are tossed aside as trash once they have fulfilled their portion of the story.\n\nThe show yearns to be an ambitious attempt at the age old question of what it means to be human, and the struggle of humanities beast within. But the show goes out of its way to make the audience feel unconnected to any character in the story. Satous characterization as a mysterious manipulator, comes off as just a man who loves to murder. Tosaki \u00e2\u0080\u0093the shows representative of the governments side\u00e2\u0080\u0093 is given small quirk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that disappear after one episode, along with a wife in a medical situation subplot that may or may not be motivating him to capture Ajin. We as the audience don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know for certain because the information the show convey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s is too obtuse, or poorly represented to feel confident in making such an assumption.\n\nAll of this just tells me that the show and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s characters are selfish. Kei, Satou and Tosaki all want something and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care how they obtain their goal, just so long as they get their own personal happiness. The show wants a dark universe where the three points of view don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t contrast each other in black and white. Instead the show presents three views on different shades of gray, without anything to act as a counter balance to it all.\n\nThis ultimately made the show feel like a chore to sit through. Individually the characters work, but presented as the three main view points of the story and the whole show collapses under the monotony of murder, and lugubrious insinuations that are offered. Again, this is not to say the show is incomprehensible, because I believe the premise of the show is interesting. But I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recommend this show when I know that there are a handful of other stories that have already successful examined the same themes as _Ajin_.\n\n__Things of Interest__\nThe 3D animation may bother some, but I  personally had no issues with it. It did not distraught me when watching the show.\n\nThe lack of music or even a notable theme really disappointed me. I found myself wanting a background music to plot exposition but I find myself struggling to recall anything noteworthy.\n\nI recommend giving the manga version of the story a chance.

Hajime Kanzaka has expressed distaste for the direction of the anime series over time, as he seems to prefer the more whimsical and episodic (read: cartoony) nature of the OVA's. I am of exactly the opposite opinion, and welcome the stronger presence of an overarching story as the series progresses. That's not to say we are absent the fun and filler-y episodes that take our party on episodic adventures between plot sections, but they tie into the plot more now than in the past, and we have more characters to go on them with now, as well.\n\n...\n\n__Writing:__ _Slayers Next_ boasts a stronger continuity than the first season, but veers in something of a strange direction that won't be ending anytime soon: Whereas the Big Bad of _Slayers_ was the demon lord Shabranigdo, this season's Big Bad is one of his minions. And, not to spoil too much, but the Big Bad of season 3... is one of HIS minions. Reverse power creep is a strange, strange thing. Nevertheless, the villains are just as threatening this time around, and we even see some stirrings of demon politics going on in the background, suggesting a much larger story going on behind the scenes. This helps to give the Slayers world a great deal more depth, setting it apart from the generic \"gather a party and slay the demon lord\" plot that, in my opinion, the first season suffered from. Season 2 plays with tropes much more than its predecessor, and even features more revolving party members--including the introduction of who I consider to be just about the best character in the series. But I digress.\n\n__Animation:__ Artwork and animation has made a step up from season 1, but it's subtle. Subtle enough that it's noticeable without being jarring, which is good. It's still a 90's anime series with 90's anime artwork, so don't expect anything too spectacular. That's part of the charm of the series, after all.\n\n__Sound:__ By season 2 the dub cast has settled into their roles and are performing them quite nicely. Gone are the sudden voice cast changes of season 1. The dub is a little corny and a little 90's, but faithful to the original script. No censorship, but one or two awkward translations/adaptations of Japanese puns, which are always a hurdle for any English translation. The Japanese dialogue lives up to the quality of the previous entries in the Slayers franchise. Some voices are too whiny and nasally for my taste, but take your preference. Music is neither exceptionally good or bad, but a little bit bland--the sound of Slayers isn't quite as iconic as other series may be with their soundtracks, but it serves its purpose as background music. An all-around average score for sound.\n\n...\n\nWhile I do consider _Slayers Next_ an improvement over _Slayers_ classic, there's still room for improvement. It's always hard to rate the individual entries in a large series like Slayers without considering the whole of the franchise, so let me end on a positive note by saying that the franchise only gets better as it progresses. _Slayers Try_ comes next, so if you're making your way through the series from the start, you can look forward to what's coming. If you've never seen anything Slayers-related, though, I wouldn't suggest jumping into the middle with _Next_ or _Try_."}, {"id": 1020, "score": 60, "body": "~~~img1280(http://i.imgur.com/WuWAlUD.png)~~~\n\n<div align=\"justify\">Stories matter.

Stories are the nation-building myths, chronicles and aspirations that, for millennia, have driven the hearts and minds of men, women and children alike.\n\nBut most importantly, stories are who we are. Even if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to admit it, even if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather forget them, each of us has hundreds of stories to tell. They mould us, shape us and craft us into what and who we are as individuals. Ultimately, each of us is the protagonist of our own biography. \n\n*Seirei no Moribito* understands this above all else. \n\n\n# Once upon a time\n----\nThe young Prince Chagum has been possessed by the spirit of a water demon. Fearing the demon will plunge his country into indefinite drought, Chagum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father orders his assassination. His mother is a little less than happy with this turn of events and arranges for Balsa, a spear-wielding mercenary and all-round badass, to protect Chagum until the threat passes. \n\n*Moribito* is a story about stories. As such, it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t nearly as action-heavy as one would initially expect. Surprisingly, aside from the frantic opening episodes and the closing few, it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t particularly plot-driven either. In fact, the series takes a near episodic approach during the middle of its run.\n\n~~~webm(https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/b077ab3e14994a1bb140e0be36b90bf8.mp4)~~~\n\nRather, *Moribito* excels at retrospective story telling. Upon our initial introductions to the cast and setting we know very little. The result is character and story development that operates in two directions: prospectively and retrospectively. \n\nProspective development is the usual fanfare and comes in the form of character interactions, world building and key plot points etcetera. \n\nRetrospective development \u00e2\u0080\u0093 growth by looking at the past \u00e2\u0080\u0093 comes in the form of storytelling. Most series would tackle this with flashbacks and whilst *Moribito* certainly has its fair share of blasts from the past, it instead chooses a slightly less heavy-handed approach: dialogue. \n\nIt isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as boring as it sounds. The series has a major thematic emphasis on the importance of oral storytelling traditions, especially as a means of cultivating cultural identity. This motif is translated seamlessly into the plethora of stories told by the characters. In fact, the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strongest and most climatic moments come in the form of one character recounting tales of bygone days to another. This generally works because the stories that are told are evocative and engaging in their own right \u00e2\u0080\u0093 more so, I would argue, than the primary story arc itself. More importantly, however, these stories pay dividends in the development of both the world and the characters that inhabit it. The stories do not only add another element of wonder to the series\u00e2\u0080\u0099 fantasy world. They breathe the life into its characters. So many dimensions are revealed as to character motivations and simply comprehending and empathising with who they really are. Their triumphs, actions and ideals \u00e2\u0080\u0093 all can be fully appreciated through stories.\n\n#When a tow truck breaks down\n---\n\nSuch a unique approach is not without its risks, however, and this reliance on storytelling is ultimately a double-edged sword. This style of presenting information doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really lend itself much room for creative diversity, and thus leads to a lot of exposition. Many of *Moribito\u00e2\u0080\u0099s* tales, particularly those implemented for plot progression, can be written off as poorly disguised info-dumps. It naturally isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the most riveting method in terms of plot development, doubly so as it tends to avert conflict and tension. \n\nIt doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help that the plot itself is somewhat dry. *Moribito*, adapted from [a novel](http://anilist.co/manga/12070/SeireinoMoribito), is actually quite generic as far as fantasy stories go. That is not to say that the plot is poorly executed, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not exactly memorable either. Furthermore, despite the high stakes, there never seems to be any real sense of urgency and so the impending threat lacks a great deal of gravity. This only exacerbates the lack of tension and results in a somewhat anticlimactic conclusion. \n\n~~~webm(https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/91c91678c401114431f2bbb8f29d61a4.mp4)~~~\n\nThe pacing can get slow at times. This is because the series transitions into a pseudo slice-of-life style around the midway point, with entire episodes dedicated to a particular element or plot point. When storytelling was involved, this produced some of my favourite episodes, particularly episode eight: \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Swordsmith\u00e2\u0080\u0099. On the other hand, some individual episodes had little to do with character, plot or world progression and as such, felt like a sore waste of time.\n\n#I.G doesn't disappoint (mostly)\n---\nThankfully, *Moribito\u00e2\u0080\u0099s* characters are incredibly well-rounded. Almost the entire cast, side-characters included, are mature, sympathetic and have clear motivations. In fact, a few irritating quirks aside, majority of the cast are really likable \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re almost too perfect.\n\nBalsa claims the spotlight. Despite her rough exterior and general badassery she has a gentle soul and a maternal side that lends itself to some truly beautiful moments with Chagum. Her backstory, wonderfully fleshed out through the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s storytelling, is indispensable in gauging her feelings and actions. The end result is one of the strongest, most determined and empathetic female leads I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve witnessed in anime.\n\nChagum is sweet beyond impair. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exceedingly resourceful and mature given his circumstances and acts in a very humbling and admirable manner. That said, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a child. He may not always act like it, but he still has the needs and hopes of every kid, doubly so given that he has been deprived of his mother. In a world that simply isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quieting to see just how Chagum copes and struggles to overcome his internal conflicts and doubts.\n\n[Production IG](http://anilist.co/studio/10/ProductionIG), as much as I love them, have this annoying habit of using some pretty awful CG models in place of background characters, vehicles, monsters etc. That said, besides episode twelve where the art randomly shits the bed, *Moribito* is a visual marvel.\n~~~img250(http://i.imgur.com/C7OwS5q.png)~~~\n~~~*Episode 12 - KILL IT WITH FIRE*~~~\n\nThe action sequences are wonderfully executed and well-choreographed. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the background art that really shines. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s simply, to be blunt, fucking gorgeous. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the first thing you notice and the thing you continue to notice. It is some of the most brilliant, vibrant, lush imagery I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen, comparable to that of *[Mushishi](http://anilist.co/anime/457/Mushishi)*, and adds so much to the wondrous fantasy feel to the world.\n~~~img1600(http://i.imgur.com/EqNzaci.png)~~~\nSimilarly, composer [Kenji Kawai](http://anilist.co/staff/5304/KenjiKawai) lives up to his reputation. Although he might be more widely known for his more haunting works (the [GitS movies](http://anilist.co/anime/43/KoukakuKidoutai), for example), the soundtrack is absolutely beautiful. The music is majestic, grand and perfectly complements the visual appeal whilst completing the overall aesthetic. The [OP/ED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHMpso3xkeQ) sadly aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as memorable. \n\n#But that's a story for another time...\n---\nFor a story about stories, it is ironically *Moribito\u00e2\u0080\u0099s* own overarching story that lets it down. When all is said and done, however, *Moribito* serves as a humbling reminder of how much power the stories we tell truly hold. Within the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s universe, they shape both character and setting, bringing them to life. In this way, *Moribito\u00e2\u0080\u0099s* world is truly a reflection of our own. \n\nGive it a watch. It certainly deserves more attention than it's gotten."}, {"id": 1027, "score": 67, "body": "Ever since K-On's success, there have been a huge surge in both slice-of-life anime featuring cute girls doing mundane things and anime where boys or girls try to get into the music scene. They say imitation is the greatest form of flattery. However, this isn't always a good thing, as there's a lot that can go wrong, such as companies making rip-offs or copies of said show, focusing too much on fanservice and doing what K-On did rather than actually having a decent story, characters, and conflict, or standing out on its own merits. If creators try too hard to copy other works, they won't be appreciated for their own merits, and if a piece of media can't stand on its own merits, then it'll just fade into obscurity. But even shows that stand out and are able to stand on their own merits aren't always good, and sometimes the show that inspired so many rip-offs may not even be that good! Despite its problems, Show By Rock definitely stands out and knows what the heck it wants. Unfortunately, it's being held back by many problems that, if rectified, could have made it so much better, had the creators been given more leeway with it.\n\nA young girl named Cyan (pronounced Shion) Hijirikawa wants to be a rock star and join her school's music club but is too shy to do it. But when she's at home, she gets an app on her phone that suddenly takes her to this magical world called Sound World, particularly one place called Midi City. It's full of half-animal half-human people called Myuumons, and music is par for the course. There are popular bands such as Trichronika, Criticrista, ShingancrimsonZ, and another band she joins called Plasmagica. She receives a sentient heart shaped guitar named Strawberry Heart that tells her she needs to defeat dark monsters that are threatening Midi City. Dark monsters are created when someone's Melodisian Stone is corrupted by negative feelings or outside forces. Cyan joins Plasmagica and gets the chance to fulfill her dream, along with saving Midi City from the dark monsters.\n\nYeah...as you can tell by the summary, the premise is admittedly very convoluted and cliche. Random kid gets taken to another world by someone or something, is the chosen one and has to defeat evil villain via insert macguffin here, make friends, etc. There's too much to deal with, and it doesn't help that the show is only twelve episodes long. It could have benefited from being a lot longer, like 26 episodes or even 39, for a variety of reasons that I'll get into. Sound World itself doesn't really get expanded upon, nor do we learn all that much about Melodisian Stones, the villain behind the scenes, what made him what he is, why certain people are so important, how and why Midi City is the way it is, etc. I do find it interesting that Sanrio (Yes, this was made by Sanrio, the people behind Hello Kitty. Just go with it) named a city after a midi file. Heck, I remember when midi files were especially popular on places like Neopets, waaay back in like, 2003-2005 or something. However, having an interesting setting doesn't matter if you can't expand upon it or use it to your advantage.\n\nSame goes for the characters. They're not bad, but there's loads and loads of them, and they're all very under developed and bland save for one character, Cyan getting the worst of it, which is actually lampshaded in the final episode. She begins and ends the show being the exact same person. She doesn't do anything, she gets scared, she doesn't do anything by herself, she's shy and insecure, she just gets dragged into things without actively doing anything about it, she's never directly affected by anything that goes on around her...she's just not very interesting as a character. Not only that, she's constantly told that she's the one who absolutely has to defeat the dark monsters, but it's never stated why she of all people has to do it. Others could have very easily been better candidates, and they never state the actual reason why SHE is the one that got picked, which makes the whole chosen one plotline very superficial. Give us a reason, dag nabbit! Sakura from CCS was made to be the cardcaptor because she accidentally released the cards from the Clow Book. Sasami from Sasami Magical Girls Club was born with her powers. Hitomi from Vision of Escaflowne had a pendant from Gaia that she inherited from her grandmother, who received it from a dying man whose son becomes her friend later on. They all start off one way, and end the series having grown and learned from their experiences. Cyan doesn't. Therefore, she's not interesting.\n\nThe other characters are no better. True, some of them do get expanded on, but it's all very predictable, and none of their backstories are actively fleshed out save for Chuchu. Retoree is shy, Moa is a cheerful alien who misses her home (and it's quickly forgotten about), Chuchu wants to be the best, etc. I have to admit though, ShingancrimsonZ is the best band in the entire show. The guys in that band are not only hilarious, but charming and are often the comedic relief despite being crazy gothic punk rock bishounen who scream a lot. They're just as bland and underdeveloped as the others, but their antics are funny enough to steal your heart. Criticrista, on the other hand, is the worst of the bunch. We're told that they're best friends who love each other, but we never see them interact much unlike with Plasmagica. It doesn't help that they're all annoyingly cute moe girls with obnoxiously high pitched voices (one of them being voiced by Rina Hidaka, one of my favorite new VAs, and as much as I like her, her work as Rosia really isn't one of her best) who are there to pander to creepy guys, etc. Everyone else is just there for eye candy or doing stuff nobody really cares about. But there are these two animal high schoolers who appear at the end of some episodes who go to school and constantly complain about wanting to go to Midi City, with one of them always saying \"Sorrrry!! X is the pits!!\" Why are these Myumons here? What purpose do they serve? Nothing! They're never used for anything, so they're just a waste of animation and broadcasting time! The producers should have ditched them and used their budget for, oh, I don't know, actual world building and character exploration? Also, Moa also has an annoying voice actress who tries way to hard most of the time, coming off really shrill in the process.\n\nAnimation wise, the show is decent, albeit way too flashy, especially with the way they draw the character's eyes. Too many sparkles and diamonds in them! It's so distracting and completely throws you off. But the character movements are fluid, the character designs are relatively decent, albeit a little too over the top for some (the water band and Criticrista being two such examples), the cosmopolitan look of Midi City is very beautiful and it kinds resembles modern day New York, as the biggest tower in the city kinda looks a lot like the Empire State Building, complete with flashy neon colored lights, etc. Also, the CGI. It is beautiful, and I do not mean that sarcastically. I'm serious. The CGI in this anime is the best I've seen. It's actually fluid, the animators actually put in effort to make it relevant to the story, and since the characters are all rendered into their animal forms during the CGI scenes, they don't fall into uncanny valley territory, and considering how anime CGI is usually REALLY bad a lot of the time, that's saying a lot. I also appreciate that the show likes to parody various animation styles, especially when ShinganCrimsonZ is involved, like having the characters go all buff and beefy a la Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, or giving them girly 70s shoujo faces complete with exaggerated faces and long eye lashes and sparkles a la Rose of Versailles. The way its used for comedy is actually pretty cool.\n\nSince the show's about music, obviously the music has to be the best part of the show, right? Well...yes and no. Pretty much everything by ShinganCrimsonZ, Trichronika, and that other band called Tsurezure is awesome, but all the other songs are mostly just bland, cutesy moe fare that grates on your ears, Criticrista's song obviously being the worst one. The opening and ending songs are no better. It's nice that the show uses a rock and roll music style, since the show is about bands and the music is actually relevant to the story, albeit used in a ridiculous, stupid, and deus ex machina-using way. However, if the songs have cutesy high pitched voices singing them, then all they are is annoying if said voices aren't in tune with the music.\n\nSo yeah. Show By Rock isn't great, but it's not bad. Cliched, yes, but not bad. It's pretty fun if you want something good to watch, and the fanservice is pretty mild for the most part. But if you're looking for more serious fare, then give it a miss. Also, ShinganCrimsonZ is awesome.

There are so many things that we do not know about space because it is the least explored frontier. The Space Age began in the 1950s and many accidents have happened since then such as the case with Apollo 13. The Space Age, however, is not showing any sign of stopping and we now have plans to colonize Mars. Space Brothers is not only a depiction of the growing optimism that we have for space exploration, but it is also a depiction of the astronauts who are willing to take many risks because of their fascination with space.\n\n<hr style=\"height:3px; border:none; color:rgb(60,90,180); background-color:rgb(60,90,180);\">\n\n__Story:__\nSpace Brothers tells a story of two siblings who once promised each other that they would become astronauts. The younger brother Hibito has stayed true to that promise and is set to become the first Japanese person on the moon. On the other hand, the older brother Mutta hasn't kept true to that promise and has given up on pursuing that dream. Mutta, who is just an average worker gets\nfired from his job for doing a silly Zidane headbutt on his boss. He then finds difficulty in getting another job because of what he did. A chance for Mutta to redeem himself suddenly shows up as JAXA have started a new project and they need astronauts. Mutta believes he can't do it, but the encouragement of Hibito changes that decision and so Mutta finally starts his long journey towards becoming an astronaut.\n\n~~~img320(https://66.media.tumblr.com/2d05ba2c764f1e965a8c1e0293046a32/tumblr_o7z342qdac1rlulmlo1_540.gif)~~~\n\nSpace Brothers is not an action-packed story with physic-defying scenes and superpowers. It is a combination of a motivational and realistic slice of life. It portrays astronauts and all the rigorous obstacles that they have to go through. From examinations to training and actual space missions, the life of an astronaut is not an easy one. Alongside that are the everyday issues that they have to deal with, especially when it comes to family and friends. This show bleeds out optimism for the future of space exploration, yet it feels simple and easygoing. Indeed it depicts all the things that astronauts have to go through, but at the same time it feels like it's just a stroll in the park. The story doesn't have enough tension and that is evident in the fact that the protagonist just breezes through all the problems that are given to him. There is not much suffering and it leaves the audience with nothing to worry heavily about. The pacing, flashbacks, ending, and two recap episodes (We already get short recaps in every episode!) don't help either. The ending felt abrupt and rushed. The goal of the siblings to go to space together was never achieved and so the audience is left having to go and read the manga instead. There were things in the show that I liked because of the realism. Things like showing actual JAXA tests (JAXA helped in making this anime) and space missions. At the end of it all, the realism in the plot of Space Brothers is definitely there, but the direction could have been handled better.\n\n__<hr style=\"height:3px; border:none; color:rgb(60,90,180); background-color:rgb(60,90,180);\">\n\n__Sound and Music:__\nOne recurring factor about this show is the change in OP and ED. In total, there are 8 opening themes and 8 ending themes. Each is unique in its own way, presenting messages that are relevant to the themes of the anime. One example of these messages is the universal dream for space travel which is presented in the first OP. Out of all the opening themes, the first one is the one that truly fits the show as it not only delivers a message about space, but also about its characters and what the story is about. I also want to highlight the awesome fourth OP which pays homage to Georges M\u00c3\u00a9li\u00c3\u00a8s' iconic silent film, A Trip to the Moon.\n\n~~~img320(https://66.media.tumblr.com/a3345e04e25734cc923578dbdeaa1f9b/tumblr_neubq5f6wE1txidmwo1_500.gif)~~~\n\nThe OST for Space Brothers is very good. They did well in creating pieces that fit the various moods throughout the anime and there are scenes that come off as emotionally strong because of the music. The only problem though is the fact that it's repetitive. I only wish they could have made more songs because it is a very long anime. As for the voice acting, there was no problem. Despite the fact that there were tons of characters from different countries, I'm actually glad that they did not resort to speaking Engrish. An awesome fact about the voice acting though, was that Akihito Hoshide (real life Japanese astronaut) dubbed his own character from the ISS!\n\n<hr style=\"height:3px; border:none; color:rgb(60,90,180); background-color:rgb(60,90,180);\">\n\n__Art and Animation:__\nFor a studio such as the likes of A-1 Pictures, you would expect great production values. However, that is not the case with Space Brothers. In this case, it can be described as average and inconsistent. There are a few scenes which I paused because the attention to detail was incredible, but that all just dies down because it gets followed by average-looking scenes. There are even several shots in this anime that are done in order to avoid more detail or character movement. One example is a shot where a NASA flight instructor looks upon a set of portraits. In that shot, however, the wall or column is blocking the view of almost half of the portraits which is done in order to avoid more detail. \n\n~~~img320(https://67.media.tumblr.com/ea066e6a7ef230af1631f384cc9ec45c/tumblr_newx24Gnnr1txidmwo1_500.gif)~~~\n\nWhat they did do well with, is the hardware and setting. It's clear that a good amount of research and effort went into both aspects. The hardware looked very authentic and the setting was accurately depicted, particularly the Kennedy Space Center and Johnson Space Center. Some of the hardware also stood out because of the CG, such as the case with a few aerial scenes that include the T-38 Talon jets. \n\n<hr style=\"height:3px; border:none; color:rgb(60,90,180); background-color:rgb(60,90,180);\">\n\n__Characters:__\nSpace Brothers has e a diverse amount of characters. Several different characters from several different countries are shown in this anime. There are characters from Japan, USA, Russia, etc. Most of the characters in this show are pretty likable especially the protagonist. Space Brothers doesn't try to be mainstream and average by putting in lolis and such. It tries to be realistic, but it fails to be amazing. \n\n~~~img320(https://67.media.tumblr.com/c1096019d74dc9aaf12d3102a233a40b/tumblr_n3kcl6AOoE1qhnmy9o1_500.gif)~~~\n\nFor characters to really stand out in a story, you need to give them flaws. If you look at the protagonist's story in Space Brothers, you would know from the get-go that it is pretty interesting. You have here, an average working man who has given up in the pursuit of his dreams. It is a story that could make for an incredible watch, but they make the protagonist do things so easily as if he was almost flawless. Another problem with the protagonist is that he acts as a comic relief, so much so that the comedy can come off as weak and not funny at times. As for the rest of the characters, some are just pointless. They're just there to act as puppets for the story. The final problem with the characters in Space Brothers is the racism. Intentional or unintentional, it was noticeable. I like the character Buddy, but the Mr. Hibbit shorts at the end of several episodes just really ruined it. Portraying Buddy as a black gorilla was a huge mistake. Some characters from different countries are also given stereotypical representations, particularly the Jamaican character and the Russian characters.

For those of you unfamiliar with this version of the show, it features one extra member of the gang who was apparently too moe for the later series, is often much more gruesome than its successor, and sticking more closely to the manga, features all manner of games, including but not limited to an extremely early, extremely simple version of Duel Monsters. Also Kaiba has green hair.\n\n...\n\n__Writing:__ As mentioned prior, this series sticks to the manga more closely than _Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters_ does. That said, things are still toned down from the manga version at least somewhat, so this series falls somewhere inbetween in terms of content. For example, where a villain might be set on fire in the manga, here they're presented a traumatic illusion that makes them think and feel as if they were set on fire. Things like that. Yami Yugi is still Game Batman, though, dishing out cold and brutal street justice to those who are asking for it.\n\nThere's a certain charm to seeing the Pharaoh as Chief Badass, rather than the more romantic and human version we see trying to learn about the mysteries of his past in _Duel Monsters_. While this series does more deeply explore a lot of the early arcs before the start of _Duel Monsters_, such as the origin of Joey and Yugi's friendship, make no mistake, it is not in the same canon, as the presence of the extra character and punk-phase Kaiba's interactions with Yugi prove. Oh, right, I was critiquing the writing, wasn't I? Overall it's fairly average for a shonen series, but some of the solutions to the games are quite clever and will keep you guessing.\n\n__Animation:__ Not stellar, not abysmal. It's the 90's, what're you gonna do? Yugi's still hoarding the world supply of hairspray, though.\n\n__Sound:__ This series was never dubbed, so expect no Dan Green. The Japanese actors do a fine job of capturing the characters, though, even if Yami Yugi's voice is a bit on the stereotypical side as far as angsty young badasses speaking Japanese go. The music, I dare say, is a strong point of the series, much more unique than that present in _Duel Monsters_, and with a transformation theme that would have been iconic had this show made it to the west. It's an earworm, that.\n\n...\n\nIf you've ever wanted to see a bishonen Two-Face take on the role of Batman and dish out street justice with gambling, you're looking at the right series. The series is as bipolar as can be, from its cute and saccharin school scenes to the dark and gritty dealings with injustice. I recommend it as a fun watch for anyone interested in this kind of dichotomy, as well as (obviously) for fans of the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise who want to see the origins of the series in animated form."}, {"id": 1047, "score": 68, "body": "Warning this Review May Contain Spoilers-\n\nTime for a Spring 2016 anime review and really this was one of the most underrated series of the season, yeah at first you are probably under the impression that this is another cute girls do stuff and that is pretty much what it is but it is worth watching. So it follows a group of girls who are really unlucky doing things that is suppsed to improve their karma but it doesn't really go to plan.\n\nSTORY\n\nThe story is simple but fun to watch, there were some episodes that were stronger in story compared to others but each have a unique feel to them.

Some parts I would of liked a bit more detail, other times I found the animation flowed kind of strangely and there is also the fact that it isn't very unique (being kind of like your typical moe style). Finally in this section, I thought the character designs were quite fitting and I'm quite glad that they didn't stray far from the manga designs (which I managed to buy the first volume of).\n\nSOUND\n\nSound was all good from me, the characters voices fitted them and all were different- no character really sounded 'similar'. The opening was cute and fluffy and really enjoyable, I also felt like the song really represented the show quite well- this is the same as the ending for me. The insert songs as well were quite sweet and added extra cutenness to the series. I also wanted to mention the piano version of the opening in the final episode which I thought was a nice peaceful way to finish off.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nNow the characters, I do admit that they aren't the most unique and follow kind of typical character tropes but I still found them pretty likeable. I do admit when Hibiki was introduced I found her quite annoying, but once again she is a character I grew towards. A bit more character development for certain characters (especially that blonde kid from the opening) would of been good but I guess we won't get another series :p So I guess I just have to use the manga to answer my questions.\n\n-SwiftArrowYui-\nPlease Note: Originally this Review was from anime-planet from my other account- AngelBeatsYui"}, {"id": 1053, "score": 50, "body": "~~~img1000(http://i.imgur.com/93YEdFC.jpg)~~~\n\nSome things are so campy they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re good. Or rather, entertaining. \n\nIt is this doctrine that has driven the success of dozens of B movies. You know it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crappy, over the top and an all-round mess. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for these very reasons that the likes of _Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!_ or _Day of the Dead_ are so much goddamn fun. \n\nAnd yet, B movies have a bad reputation (and the name) for good reason too. Regardless of how zany and self-gratifying they may be, they all too commonly suffer from flaws in direction, story and character development. Not to mention the shitty budgets. \n\n\n~~~img480(http://i.imgur.com/fJJMMoY.jpg)~~~\n~~~_Ogon' po gotovnosti!_\n~~~\nThe key to overcoming these faults is consistent self-awareness. A good B movie never tries to take itself too seriously. Of course, this does not mean they must be devoid of meaningful thematic exploration or social commentary; just look at the works of Carpenter or Romero. But the moment when a piece that had previously thrived on its campiness attempts to reassert itself as a poignant, deep or otherwise serious literary work, and at the cost of its corny charm, is the moment when a B movie falls flat.\n\n_Koutetsujou no Kabaneri_ proves that anime is no exception. \n\n#[They're coming to get you, Barbara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd04SwR2eU8)\n***\n\n[Continuing with my trend of uncomprehensive and depreciative single-sentence premise rehashings](http://i.imgur.com/nsyr4nS.jpg), _Kabaneri_ is about a group of zombie apocalypse survivors in steampunk feudal Japan. Oh, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on a big ass train. If that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exude copious quantities of awesome, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what does. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s such a ridiculous and outlandish concept that, ironically, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m surprised no one had thought of it sooner. \n\n~~~img480(http://i.imgur.com/cYRJQO2.jpg)\n~~~\nThankfully, _Kabaneri_ experienced no evident budget shortages. [Studio Wit]( http://anilist.co/studio/858/WitStudio) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 who are in familiar territory \u00e2\u0080\u0093 have given the show a unique but no less gorgeous visual aesthetic. [Haruhiko Mikimoto](http://anilist.co/staff/1968/HaruhikoMikimoto) has gone back to his roots to produce some spectacular character designs reminiscent of the classic 80s OVAs. \n\n~~~img480(http://i.imgur.com/wxw37Qz.jpg)~~~\n\nIn fact, the aesthetic in general, from the art to the soundtrack and from the fluid animation to the ridiculous setting, is really nice. All these elements work in tandem to establish an absurd but incredibly _fun_ atmosphere, whilst the quality remains consistent. In this way, right from the very first episode, we know what to expect. It may not be the most astutely crafted of shows, but it sure as hell looks and feels dope.  \n\n~~~webm(https://my.mixtape.moe/wihzxc.webm)~~~\n\n#Out of the blocks\n***\n\nIndeed, _Kabaneri_ starts off flying. We are instantly rewarded with gory, stylised action sequences, mounting catastrophes, clich\u00c3\u00a9 tragic backstories and beautifully over-the-top voice acting (damn these guys love yelling) complete with inspiring monologues that practically scream of badassery. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stupid and self-indulgent, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why the show is initially so appealing. \n\n~~~img390(http://i.imgur.com/j846mbe.jpg) img390(http://i.imgur.com/71f0OzL.jpg)~~~\n\nThe plot during these early stages is virtually non-existent and mostly centres on the themes of overcoming fear and paranoia and maintaining one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s humanity. The usual zombie subject matter. Although _Kabaneri_ doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really bring anything new to the table in this regard, its exploration of these themes never becomes boring and is handled tactfully enough such that they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t become overbearing and detract from the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s zaniness. \n\nThis is largely thanks to the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s characters. Admittedly, none of them are particularly complex or original. The side cast are especially dull and only fulfil individual archetypes. That said, they are diverse and likable enough such that they never become too much of a hindrance, even if we never really end up caring about any of them. Also, Max Powers is friggen\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hilarious. \n\n~~~img480(http://i.imgur.com/MTLandQ.jpg)~~~\n\nEven the primary duo in Ikoma and Mumei are fairly stock standard. Ikoma is loud, proud and obnoxious, spurred on by constant self-flagellation and a misgiving past. Mumei is loli ninja super assassin coming to terms with who she is in a world largely unwilling to accept her, not to mention her own unfortunate backstory. These inner-conflicts and turmoils have been tackled a hundred times before and far more effectively. And yet, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nearly impossible not to like them, simply because of how much raw energy and charisma they bring. Sure they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re clich\u00c3\u00a9 and pretty shallow, but we still want them to succeed purely because of how badass they are.\n\n~~~img390(http://i.imgur.com/YfgBRLd.jpg) img390(http://i.imgur.com/He0cPQV.jpg)~~~\n\nIn this way, the first few episodes see the plot and the characters, lacking as they might be, work to reinforce the absurdity, stupidity and most importantly, pure entertainment factor of the show. \n\nThen, an overarching plot was introduced. \n\n#Do you ever feel like a plastic bag?\n***\n\nThis coincides with the introduction of the main villain. In short, he is poorly-fleshed out, has hazy motivations, confusing goals and a cartoonish depiction. This may not appear to be too much of an issue, granted that most of the cast prior to his entrance were just as, if not more uninspired. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d argue, however, that none of them are nearly as messy as Mr L\u00e2\u0080\u0099Or\u00c3\u00a9al here.\n\n~~~img480(http://i.imgur.com/bo6Js08.jpg)~~~\n~~~_Because you're worth it_~~~\n\nRather, the problem lies in his purpose. The show takes Biba and uses him as a thematic mouthpiece. These themes of fear, paranoia and weakness and strength in a world dominated by the dead had hitherto taken a backseat to all the action and yelling, but were relevant and handled carefully enough such that they were still somewhat meaningful. Immediately upon Biba\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entrance, the show takes these themes and starts forcibly shoving them in the viewer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face. In other words, the series dramatically shifts its focus from the fun and the absurd to the serious and pseudo-intellectual. \n\n~~~img480(http://i.imgur.com/yQrqoZv.jpg)~~~\n\nThis doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work for a few reasons. \n\nFirstly, it completely juxtaposes the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s atmosphere and attitude in its first half. The transition is abrupt, jarring and comes with little to no warning. \n\nSecondly, successful thematic exploration usually relies on successful character and story development. These were not _Kabaneri_\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strengths, nor do they suddenly reinvent themselves to be. If anything, the plot only goes downhill from here. Biba\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motivations are poorly connected to his actions and goals, or at least, a satisfying explanation is never really provided. \n\nIt also doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help that the show begins taking serious liberties as far as logic and the suspension of disbelief is concerned. Why do the Hunters follow the clearly bat shit crazy Biba? Why can kitchen knives suddenly cut through 50cm thick steel cables? Why does every authority figure have the decision making capability of a retarded three year old? Why are there superzombies that scream with the force of a small nuclear bomb exploding? All of these small yet simple things somehow manage to break immersion, which is an incredibly difficult feat for a show as blatantly insane as this. \n\n~~~img480(http://i.imgur.com/Rygoen7.jpg)~~~\n\nFinally, the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s themes and messages are simply not as profound as it makes them out to be. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re mundane and oversaturated, and only serve to distract the show from its actual strengths. \n\nTo the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s credit, I would argue that the final episode does shine some light on Biba\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character and bestows upon him another layer of complexity and depth. This dude sums it up pretty nicely: \n~!img700(http://i.imgur.com/ujJGjVH.png)!~\n\nThat said, it is too little too late. This fails to redeem the series for its previous misgivings or conclusively explain all of Biba\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prior actions. \n\n~~~img480(http://i.imgur.com/1BVdXlD.jpg)~~~\n\nAnd yet, despite all of this _Kabaneri_ continues to be kinda fun. Sure it skews its priorities and is horrible at min/maxing, but at least it remembers its roots as an absurd, zany and entertaining gore fest. And sure, unimpressive and predictable thematic exploration may overshadow this fun, but Kurusu never stops Ayame-samaing, Max Powers never stops being hysterical and Ikoma never stops yelling. \n\n~~~img390(http://i.imgur.com/qPYPzUB.jpg) img390(http://i.imgur.com/usBhTB4.jpg)~~~\n\n#[Party's over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3svq8EX01U)\n***\n_Kabaneri_ tries to take itself too seriously without the writing to back it up.

It just seemed to drag on and a few episodes felt like deja vu. It's concept was explored within the first few episodes and until midway through the series it had my interest. Many episodes just hammered in the same idea, that yes they were becoming friends. Likewise every episode asked the exact same question, Is it because of Kiznaiver or not? I feel like they could have removed the \"friends\" narrative and replaced it with a stronger love one. This would probably would have made for a solid romance anime. \n~~~img220(https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ATzDRJuuUHE/maxresdefault.jpg)~~~\n\nNonetheless I still continued to watch, but i think that was due to its great animation and some feel good moments. I really like the relationship the characters but thats really about it. It was somewhat enjoyable for the first few episodes despite its muddled narrative. Even though it was inevitable that they would all be happy in the end, i still watched on. I would also like to add that spring season was really lack luster which was probably why i watched this in the first place.\n~~~img220(http://i.imgur.com/GFPRk5o.jpg)~~~\n\n I can understand for some that they could completely dislike it outright, furthermore i would also understand someone who would fall in love with this anime.

What was a real insult to injury for me though was the fact that Sonozaki and Katsuhira could have had a much better resolution. The only tangible plot was between those two characters and there resolution only lasted 5 minutes of screen time.\n                                                                     ~~~img220(http://i.imgur.com/gwkQNwR.jpg)~~~\n\nTL:DR: Kiznaiver is an extraordinarily average anime whose concepts exceeds its reality.

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d argue that his greatest strength and an underlying thread that connects all his works is his minimalistic approach. \n\nSimplicity is the key. From his sparing character designs to his straightforward but often powerful camera movements. Even his stories usually address simple but no less meaningful themes through the ordinary lives of his ordinary characters, save for a minor fantastical twist here and there. \n~~~img480(http://i.imgur.com/H8lAGXa.jpg)~~~\n\nHosoda has built a career on being a minimalist.

Films that were really hard-edged, slick and stylish. Gradually, I changed my mind about that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think the point of filmmaking is to make slick films like that. I think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m now looking to make something more orthodox and more simple.\"</h3> \n\nWhich is why _The Boy and the Beast_ somewhat confuses me. \n\n#Like peas in a pod\n***\nRen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s divorced mother has died in an accident. With his father nowhere to be found, he runs away and stumbles into the fantastic, parallel world of the Beast Kingdom. There he meets Kumatetsu, a crazy strong but crazy irresponsible manbearpig, who eventually raises Ren as his teacher and surrogate father. \n~~~img480(http://i.imgur.com/cP2TJaq.jpg)~~~\n\nWhile _Wolf Children_ addresses motherhood, _The Boy and the Beast_ deals with fatherhood. That said, the symbiotic nature of the parent-child relationship in _Bakemono_ is a lot more pronounced. From the outset both Ren and Kumatetsu are very obviously flawed characters, if a tad generic. Like father like son I guess, as both are loud, obnoxious and selfish. And yet, there is sufficient reasoning for these traits as to make the pair considerably nuanced and well-developed.\n\n~~~img480(http://i.imgur.com/2viGFVb.jpg)~~~\n\nRen is resentful and lonely. Having lost those he cares most about, he feels trapped and abandoned by the world. It is this same sense of abandonment that drives Ren, making him determined to become strong such that the world can never hurt him again. \n\nKumatetsu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s irresponsibility stems from the fact that he lacked a parent figure. In order to survive and grow stronger, he needed to be selfish and had no room for philanthropy, nor was he ever shown any. With this in mind, he is still good-natured at heart. \n\nBoth father and son have much to learn. And, as expected, they learn from each other. But it is this relationship, watching the two grow together, and their charming interactions and how their similarities and differences meld and clash that is the film\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most gratifying aspect. It is fun and fulfilling, complete with banter and feelsgoodman training montages. Ultimately, as predictable as it is, seeing both father and son transcend their original self-centred goals and personalities, and only with each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s guidance, is uplifting. \n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/UtFMwHB.jpg) img440(http://i.imgur.com/u0BZI2G.jpg)~~~\n\n#Fuckin' whales\n***\nAs such, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s both confusing and a little disappointing when the film drastically deviates from this central relationship. This occurs most notably upon the introduction of the main villain. In short, everything about him is ham-fisted. From his one-dimensional, cartoonish portrayal (cue manic laughter) to the god-awful, tacky _Moby Dick_ motif that is sledgehammered into the viewer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, it all feels so bloated and unnecessary. I understand his role as a parallel to Ren such that Ren could conclusively resolve his inner-turmoil and complete his coming-of-age, but again, it feels so awkward. \n\n~~~img480(http://i.imgur.com/rOJC557.jpg)~~~\n\nAs opposed to introducing a rushed and caricatured external source of conflict as a means of resolving their inner-conflicts, I felt as if the film would have benefited from a more climatic, internal struggle between Ren and Kumatetsu. Not only would have this allowed the film to keep to its strengths, it would have also provided more screen time to develop the pair\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship. \n\nAnd here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the problem: by over-complicating the story and introducing these extra, ham-fisted characters and plot points, time that could be spent further developing the main characters and their relationship is wasted. And this shows. Despite its merits, Ren and Kumatetsu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship simply lacks the emotional weight present in Hana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship with her children, which is much more acutely focused on and developed in _Wolf Children_. \n\n~~~img480(http://i.imgur.com/UW1rHla.jpg)~~~\n\nThe side characters are forgettable. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this subplot introduced in the second act that, although sporting an understandable purpose, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really make an impression. \n\n#My name is Tony and this is _Every Frame A_...\n***\n\nHosoda also forgoes his signature simplicity with the film\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visual presentation, specifically with the use of crowds. Come to think of it, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think there have ever been so many people concurrently onscreen in any of his other films. He uses some pretty ugly CG models here, and although I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve definitely seen worse, they could have been done without (especially as this is a big-budget movie). \n~~~img480(http://i.imgur.com/rldCaUp.jpg)~~~\n~~~_Some IG approved CGI right here_~~~\n\nEarlier I mentioned how Hosoda is generally both proficient and efficient with his camera movements. For some reason, the movements in _The Boy and the Beast_ are really noticeable and jarring. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure if Hosoda was doing things more liberally, or if I was just noticing it more because I was distinctly aware of his usual proficiency with the technique. Regardless, it felt like there were a tonne of pans and rotations that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really add anything. Of course, some moments are pretty neat, like when a character was teleporting around and the camera movements helped establish a sense of playful confusion. \n\nOther than that, the art is pretty solid. Colour wise, there is a nice contrast between the dark and artificial Shibuya and the light pastels of the Beast Kingdom. Character designs are neat and simple, like always. \n\n~~~img480(http://i.imgur.com/rHFKmKD.png)~~~\n\n#'Slick'\n***\nI feel as if Hosoda was too ambitious with _The Boy and the Beast_.  The film loses focus of its core relationship and instead introduces too many forgetful or otherwise plain frustrating elements. If Hosoda had stuck to his guns, further exploring the magic and depth of the very simple yet emotionally stimulating relationship between Ren and Kumatetsu, then I think the film would have been much more rewarding. \n\n~~~img480(http://i.imgur.com/1cefCUJ.jpg)~~~\n\nWhile there are still plenty of feel good vibes to be had from _The Boy and the Beast_, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all you can really get from it. It overstepped its bounds when it was all going so well. Ultimately, it lacks significant weight and fails to make much of an impression.

This may be a long review, so please, bear with me. There may be spoilers as well; they will be marked.\n\n__Story (70/100)__: What gets most interested is the story. In a world, set in what is presumed to be that of steampunk, is full of mysteries and horrors as the characters are caged in enormous walls that protect them from one enemy: the titans. Just a gist of what goes on mostly throughout the story. What I enjoy about the story is that it focuses on one enemy, unlike many other shows of the same genre, where they fight one enemy for three chapters, then move on into a power-up party. \n\nHowever, the execution of this seemingly interesting plot is sadly, sub-par. Like many others, the first few episodes/chapters can be exciting, with the action and introduction of the world and characters. While I read reviews of people getting the shakes, crying, and covering their mouths in horror over the anime, I decided to read the manga\u00e2\u0080\u0094it seemed to be right up my alley. Sadly, it didn't deliver. My face was about as blank as a clean slate while reading, and it still is after over a half a hundred chapters.\n\nSnK is an action-oriented, plot-driven story. A plot-driven story is as its name suggests: focusing on the plot moving forward, and toward the main goal. Characters can be given little light to shine in these kinds of stories. However, what this show does wrong is it tries to not only be plot-driven, but character-driven as well. Character-driven is when the story focuses more on the development of the characters in order to have you attached to them, you know, just in case something happens that will make you wish the author was dead.  Isayama (the author) tries  hard to focus on _both _ themes, and I applaud him for that. A good story has both, but it can also go wrong.\n\nThe story begins to go downhill after the \"Clash of Titans\" arc. It becomes very political-heavy\u00e2\u0080\u0094don't get me wrong\u00e2\u0080\u0094I love me some good Game of Thrones-style politics where humans are pitted against each other\u00e2\u0080\u0094but this just doesn't fit with this story. It is long, dragged out, and quite frankly, a bit boring. There are revelations, but some of them many fans may have already guessed in the the beginning.\n\nAnother thing I would like to finalize about the story is the mysteries\u00e2\u0080\u0094I love world-building mysteries. Where did the Titans come from? Are the natural? What are they? But when my then-7 year old brother could understand the mysteries you are putting on the table, something is off. Well, either that, or it may because he's gifted with intelligence and caught on early. ~!Not only this, but I was enjoying this up until superpowers became prominent. Having the protagonist become the ultimate enemy just to let him see their side of their story is a bit of a cop-out to flesh out the enemy.\n!~\n__Art (60/100)__:  I love me some good art.  But SnK does not have good art. In the beginning, it looked like my 5 year old sister drew it with her eyes closed. A very major turn-off for many, including me, who tends to look at aesthetics after story. If a story has below sub-par art, it makes it hard for to get through.  SnK does just that. The art is atrocious, but gets better over time. Not Touya Mikanagi good, but OK. You can see what's going on, because it's clearer than before, however, often times, it suffers a bad case of BLEACH\u00e2\u0080\u0094so much ink you don't know if that's a character, or a bush.\n\n__Character (60/100)__: The characters. Oh, the characters. I have been in so many arguments about the characters, its not even funny anymore. Cringe-worthy? Some. Archetypal? Some. Underdeveloped? Most of them. \n\nThe characters, without a doubt, are memorable. Not because of how good they are, but because of their names, and appearances.\n- Eren\u00e2\u0080\u0094I have not much to say about Eren. At times, he is the typical shounen main character who screams a lot, to a depressing, suicidal idiot. I never really enjoyed his character , and with the direction he is going, I dislike him even further.\n- Mikasa\u00e2\u0080\u0094the stoic, raven-haired beauty who happens to be one of the strongest soldiers. I get Isayama wanted strong female characters, but sometimes he goes overboard. With Mikasa especially. He goes to great lengths to show she is stronger than everyone else. She can do things Eren for some reason can't do, Even though he is pretty much capable of doing. Carrying crates? Who can't carry crates, Eren? Another flaw is that she focuses too much on Eren. She hasn't really developed. I would like for her to care for others, not just ask if they are OK. That's not development. That's just asking if they are OK. If she was done better, I could see myself liking her, but she's too far gone.\n\n- Armin\u00e2\u0080\u0094I love, love, love Armin. At first, I was a bit iffy about him, because he was the intelligent-info dumper, and I don't like those. However, he began to grow on me, and voila! He was one of the first to develop! I love the direction he's going. From the cowardly kid he was in the beginning, to the calculating, decent manipulator like Erwin.\n\nThe rest of the characters have been decently fleshed out, but more and more of them are becoming prominent, and are lacking in the development department big time.\n\n__Overall (60/100)__Overall, it is decent story, but definitely doesn't deserve the hype its receiving. However, if you like a shounen that is a bit different in some areas, than this is the manga for you."}, {"id": 2071, "score": 50, "body": "<p>This manga has been sitting on my PTR list for quite some time, ever since people got hyped about it getting an anime adaptation scheduled to air this summer. And before checking out the anime, I decided to actually read it. It's quite short, being only 5 volumes (which, somehow, apparently took 3 years to publish, but ok). So it seems that on this day, I recieved a grim reminder of why I generally stay away from romance genre. And while it isn't abysmal by any stretch of imagination, it has some elements that just don't work... at all.\n<p>The premise of the story is pretty straightforward: _Save Kakeru and get rid of your future regrets._ While \"Save Kakeru\" part is intentionaly vague at the begining, it crystallizes a lot more as time progresses. And this is where this work gets to a first major roadblock: you pretty much have to turn a blind eye to a lot of things for the story to actually be consistent with itself. As much as the time traveling (not even going to delve into their explanation of that, provided by none other than a chemistry teacher because plot required it) letter might seem like a good idea, it pretty much single handedly managed to ruin the story. And when your whole story hinges on said letter, it isn't really a good idea to have it hinged so loosely, because if Naho had done the first thing the letter asked her to, the rest of it would almost immediately be rendered null and void. \n<p>Now, this story isn't a sci-fi, it's a romance. But guess what, the romance was handled just as poorly as the time traveling corner they needlessly wrote themselves into, and a large chunk of the problem in it were the characters. Because it takes two to tango, and boy oh boy, does Naho have three left feet. \n<p> With the cast of 6 main characters (possibly +1 for a \"rival\"), this manga gave itself a rather ambitious task of handling them all effectively, and it seems its solution to this was to \na) focus on only one end romance the whole cast strives towards (smart call on that one, kudos)\nb) spicing things up with some side things of no big end importance \\*cough*\nc) shoving more than half a cast to the side giving them only basic outlines of personality (no kudos for you on this one)\n<p>I mean, this tactic kinda works in its favor. It's a relatively short series, so who really gives a damn. It had trouble maintaining only one romance plot, imagine cramming like three more in there. Some of the comic relief moments and interactions between the side main characters are pretty funny, and are, alongside Kakeru, highlights of the show. Kakeru was handled really well (his mother on the other side... oh boy...), maybe a tad oversimplified at times in my opinion, Suwa was kinda on the meh side, but bearable. And even with ALL that, all the good moments, all the good artwork (and artwork is __really__ good for this type of thing), Naho single-handedly plummets the show to never before seen lows. Maybe people enjoy the whole _will-they-won't-they_, _loves me-loves me not_ dynamic stemming from stupidity she has going on, maybe people like having a heroine that could easily be replaced by a carrot with no real reprecussions to the plot. __I don't know. Maybe she's just too good and pure for my understanding of normal human beings.__\n<p>All in all, if romance is your shtick, you should give it a try, it's a pretty solid and standard addition to the genre, with a satisfying ending and some interesting themes. I hope everyone that liked it enjoys this summer's adaptation. If you're not a romance person, then this isn't really a thing to check out or start with, since there are probably things to get you into the genre that handle things this manga botched, like characters (especially its main cast), progression and the story itself, a lot better. And if, like me, you're __DEFINITELY__ not the romance type of person, then you should know by now to stay away from it.

Honestly it wasn't a terrible manga it was just so rushed, everything was solved pretty much within the 12 chapters (other than a couple of things). \n\nSTORY\n\nSo the story involves our main Gilles who gets paired up with a girl Luna who ends up being the vampire empress (which isn't really a spoiler as you find that out quite early for the story to progress but yeah I did warn you). But it was squashed, the whole story just appeared to be as rushed as possible, so much was crammed into 12 chapters and for me that didn't allow any development towards the characters as well as the story. I believe if they had spread the story out a bit more and allowed for more character development to take place I may of been able to say more.\n\nART\n\nThe art was good, yeah there were moments were I thought this could be drawn slightly better but it was still to a generally high standard. Character designs however are quite simple and I felt like some could be improved slightly more.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nAs for characters Gilles is our main who seems a bit typical in the sense that he has a common grudge against vampires and the whole revenge plot reflected quite heavily on him as a character. Luna is our main female and honestly she wasn't a terrible character but she didn't have much if any development as a character, yeah we know the basics but there was still so much that could of been discovered about her.\n\nOverall not a terrible series but the ending should of been less open and the story shouldn't of been squashed like it was, characters and art were good in most cases it was just the story that let it down.\n\n-SwiftArrowYui-\nPlease Note: Originally this Review was from anime-planet from my other account- AngelBeatsYui"}, {"id": 2073, "score": 62, "body": "Warning this review may contain spoilers:\n\n\nSo this is my review for the 11eyes manga hopefully this will be better than my poorly written one for the anime. Well to start off the story follows a boy Kakeru mainly and how he gets dragged into a fantasy world with a close friend, Yuka (who is slightly annoying and I really don't like her much). Then he gets involved with all this fighting demons and stuff, blah blah blah. Pretty much follows the same story as the anime, makes sense as they were both based off the same Eroge and made around the same time.\n\nSTORY\n\nThe overall story seemed to be pretty well laid out, there was tension and drama between chapters and the start of the story was well written. They also did a good job at drawing an audience in from the looks of it. Another thing is that how the situation was explained, like why they were being dragged into this other world, was well sorted out in the early chapters. BY chapter 6 we had the main 6 characters in the story from here you would expect it to get better. At the halfway point the story seems strong but rushed slightly, I guess this is because they are aiming it to be a short manga. Chapter 6 though seemed like they were only trying to build the relationship between certain characters. Chapter 7 seemed strange...but I guess that is just me. Finally the final chapters, it all seemed way to forced and rushed, personally this manga needed a few more chapters. Something just seemed off. However this ending was much better than the ecchi pointlessness of the anime.\n\nART\n\nThe art was well drawn I personally thought it was well presented overall. However I wish that there was slightly more detail in the character's eyes due to the fact that when they weren't coloured I thought that the detail that could of been there wasn't there.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nThe characters were alright, like in the anime I liked some characters and hated others. Kakeru was your typical character that is weak at the start but then grows to become one of the strongest. Yuka, the annoying childhood friend that annoyed me so much in both anime and manga. Other characters I wish there was more development for them. This short manga had pretty much no character development and let down the manga quite a bit.\n\nOverall this manga was average, the character development was weak but the story-line ideas were there. They just needed a bit more \n\n-SwiftArrowYui-\nPlease Note: Originally this Review was from anime-planet from my other account- AngelBeatsYui"}, {"id": 2081, "score": 65, "body": "##__Nisekoi: AKA Blue Balls the Anime Season 2__##\n__WARNING__\nBefore I begin, if you don't like the idea of your best girl getting judged; then I recommend to stop reading this review. Your favourite girls will be judged and it may or may not anger you. \n__WARNING END__\nI delayed watching Nisekoi: for the longest time, primarily because of the first season being rather bland and it's poor character development. Majority of the characters only had only their established personalities and did not develop at all throughout the entirety of the anime. What was there was only events that only made it __seem__ that there was character development but only made the characters look even more static. In season 2, there was actually character development that felt like it was going somewhere and attempts to tie up loose ends. Unfortunately, all it is is a decent attempt at adapting the manga. The characters have a lot of depth this time around but the anime falls into the same song and dance from the first season. \n\n##__Story__##\nThe story is the same as where we left off. Raku still doesn't know who the girl he made the promise with years ago is. The girls all like him but they know that they could well as not be the girl that the promise was made with and they try to make him fall in love with them to avoid a case of unrequited love. The girls end up trying to capture his attention through many crazy antics and this generally causes some funny moments and some awkward/serious moments such as when we're let in on the secret as to why Chitoge loves her bow as much as she does. \nThe plot itself is rather poor. They managed to create a bit of focus with the plot this time around but because of the way they focus the plot it ends up detracting from all the other moments in the story. Where we would think that some characters would get a bit more screen time because they are part of the main cast; they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even get anything besides some scenes that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have an impact on their personality and a flashback one off episode.\nThe anime itself is very short having only 12 episodes. What they chose to do with the 12 episode span was still rely on Nisekoi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chaotic nature to carry the show and at the same time bring the focus in on something. In the end it falls very short. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help develop characters consistently and majority of the arcs that they go through feel very rushed as most of them are only one or two episodes and feel like they were one offs and have no impact to the actual plot. In fact the plot this time around is focused solely on main girl Chitoge. This is fine, but if one were to watch this anime without being told of this they wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly know what the plot was.\nEach episode is about a specific girl/minor character and each episode intends to flesh them out slightly for some reason or the other. This only works sometimes, but majority of the time it comes off with almost no weight at all. By that I mean that while the impact may be in the episode it occurs in, the rest of the anime acts like there was no effect at all. There is no __weight__ to the events that occur for majority of the characters, and this occurs for many of the characters and only really changes one or two giving some episodes a self-contained feeling. \nIt was obvious they wanted Nisekoi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trademark chaos, but having organized chaos is a harder task to achieve especially the way the anime played out. Despite the nonsensical filler episode that did nothing for the plot they still did try.Is the plot a lot better than the first season? Yes it certainly is a somewhat average plot albeit with all the self-contained arcs. It just stops it from being something actually extremely good and confuses the viewer on what actually they should be focusing on. \n With that said, there is still redeeming qualities about the story. Romance is the most obvious theme in the story, but it is well done in this season as opposed to its predecessor. Instead of \u00e2\u0080\u0098blue-balling\u00e2\u0080\u0099 people with stereotypical events that do nothing for the plot or characters, Nisekoi: creates really interesting moments of love in its episode. We see real love from some of the characters rather than some of the exaggerated love scenes we saw in the past season. Yes, this is an anime but when you can see someone actually feel conflict with themselves about their love whether it be their older than you like in Shu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case with his teacher or one that you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to feel about like in Haru\u00e2\u0080\u0099s situation.\nNisekoi: handles love to the point where when it is shown, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but feeling something towards that  character at that point; even Kosaki and backstory have some sort of charm to it. Nisekoi: has its comedy which can make you giggle from time to time. But as a romance anime it does its job decently, you can genuinely feel that emotion from the characters which allows for some of the one off episodes of Nisekoi: to be bearable. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s charming, amusing and even sometimes very sad, Nisekoi: certainly did the romance part of its story very well.\n\n##__Characters__##\nThe characters in Nisekoi are the focal point of the anime. The story takes a sideline as each character gets a sub story inside the main story so as to develop their characters through one off or two episode arcs which is fine. However out of the main characters, only one of them gets any real serious development and that girl is Chitoge. There are some other glaring issues with Nisekoi: especially in the character department besides this. \n\nWhen we see Tsugumi again in this season, she still is the same awkward girl from last time and still likes Raku. The episode in question takes place to allow her to solidify her stance with where she is in the weird love triangle Nisekoi has created.  In this we see her acknowledge that she loves Raku but she understands that Chitoge likes him as well and chooses to put aside her selfish desires and just be friends with Raku. This is a great way to change her character and make her into a companion of sorts for Raku on his misadventures. Unfortunately, this change isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly shown anywhere in the later episodes and in fact the only time it is even remotely shown is when Raku asks for advice from her. This of course is something a friend would do, but Tsugumi doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to have changed whatsoever from that previous episode. This not only ruins her character, but makes having that episode illogical and irrelevant. \nAnother example of these situations are Kosaki , Paula and Haru. \nMarika\u00e2\u0080\u0099s development is weirdly treated but the unlike with Tsugumi it works for her. The episodes of her are mainly for comic relief and showing just how crazy she can get. This fits with her character as a headstrong nutcase as nothing really can change her mind about who she loves and who she wants to marry, that being Raku. However, they do decide to touch on her personality and she is very aware of the blossoming relationship between Chitoge and Raku. This is a very nice moment because it shows how aware Marika is of the people around her. As a result of this, she creates a scheme to sabotage Raku\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship with every girl. This ignoring of events fits her character, but also acknowledges her selfishness. This change fits Marika while it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fit Tsugumi.\n\nKosaki, Paula and Haru are some of the worst characters because they are almost all sideline characters who get not even a smidge of development, yes even Kosaki who is supposed to be a main girl gets treated like this. Both Onodera sisters end up falling for Raku but the major issue with this is how both of them get treated differently. Kosaki gets an even worse arc than even her sister who isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even supposed to be a main character. The events of their result in Haru falling in love with Raku and her seeing him for the gentle and kind guy that he is, but does almost nothing for Kosaki and only makes her seem __even more static__ that she already is. At least Haru gets some development and we can see her conflicting emotions, should she trust this guy who could be a player? Should she just fall in love with him? Or should she just leave him alone and let her sister make her moves on him? \nThis is a wonderful conflict as it makes Haru look more human and more likeable than her sister, which is sad because Kosaki ends up having nothing truly significant to call it development rather than a flashback to show why she fell in love with Raku and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about it which is just a reason and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about it. \nPaula has almost no relevancy in the anime other than Tsugumi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little arc. She provides almost nothing like Ruri and Shu to the story. Whilst Ruri and Shu are developed to deeply caring about their friends and know that they can only do so much; Paula is there simply for pandering purproses. There isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anything wrong with pandering, but if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s her entire character, then what is the point of having her there in the first place? \nWhile this is the case, this not the biggest flaw with the characters of Nisekoi: the greatest strength and flaw of Nisekoi: is Chitoge. While all the other characters are sidelined or not paid much attention to, we see Chitoge being the focal point for the entire season. Which is great, the series has finally learnt how to focus on one thing. We see Chitoge change from her brutish and gorilla-like behavior to an actual person with feelings and worries and fears. We see her actually cry and wonder about her part in Raku\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life. \nThis is her greatest fault however, because she is the only developed character like this and because of the magnitude of the development it overshadows Raku and all the other main characters. This means that you have lopsided character development for everybody. With only Chitoge really getting any spotlight everyone else really falls into the background even Raku himself as his only development is really realizing his partial feelings for Chitoge. As I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve stated before with these main characters falling behind Chitoge it makes the anime more about her than about Raku and his quest for love. And ultimately causes majority of the characters to feel underdeveloped or almost not important, which for the main cast to feel like, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a good thing at all. \n\n##__Visuals and Sound__##\nNisekoi:\u00e2\u0080\u0099s was certainly a big one as a lot of the visuals in the anime are superb. The character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motions, facial reactions and flow of motion. With all the outrageous action that occurs in Nisekoi: it really does help give fluidity to the characters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 personalities. It isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just the visuals themselves that evoke emotions; the sound as well is the final puzzle piece to create the whole picture. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just the voice actors emoting, but how the scenery looks and the sound that will inevitably suggest to you what you should be feeling at that moment. \n\nwebm(https://files.catbox.moe/sz76wk.webm)\nIn this scene we hear a very slow and sweet piano piece along with the blooming of flowers and cherry blossoms. This is how we meet Haru. What this scene shows to us is a beginning as cherry blossoms can bloom in January; the start of a new year. The flowers blooming show us this too. The music gives us a very sleepy and relaxing vibe; as if this is a very happy and joyful time. The petals dance about in the air as the song grows more complex as if dancing along with the music. Then our character in the scene starts speaking. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very young girl and as she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going into a new school she herself is new to the experience at high school bringing in the entire feeling of new. Everything is new in this scene. As her excitement rises for the new experiences so does the song and in response the petals flow crazily matching the \u00e2\u0080\u0098rhythm\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of the scene. As the Haru\u00e2\u0080\u0099s excitement increases, so does the beauty and motion of the scenery and so does the song itself. This scene is essentially giving to us her hopes and dreams and her desires at the very end where the petals forming into a heart showing her hope for a new love or __the__ love of her life. \n\nwebm(https://files.catbox.moe/dq7qxm.webm)\n\nIn this scene we see a different feeling; for context, this pastry is to be for the season of autumn and it is supposed to encompass the feeling of that season. So as it begins we see the screen completely dark with only someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands reaching and grabbing this strange orb and it turns out to be a sweet. After Onodera bites into and consumes the sweet her eyes begin to open, at that same moment a very energetic and light hearted violin begins to play. Sparkles are being heard as the camera zooms outwards to show her floating in the middle of the darkness; a strange light suddenly gets brighter and brighter around her as she is teleported into a new world. The song of autumn surrounding just as the falling leaves and wind twirls her around. This shows the events that usually occurs during the season; Kosaki is obviously enjoying it as soon she twirls around and faces the camera her arms outstretched as if trying to fly and laughing. This expresses how one might feel during this month where you can jump into piles of leaves and enjoy the slightly cold air as it slowly turns into winter. As quickly as this feeling comes it leaves her smiling again with the black backdrop symbolizing how quickly autumn comes and goes. \nThe expressive and symbolic nature of the visuals is what makes Nisekoi a joy to watch. Shaft understands how to have their characters emote and as well have their scenery express emotion itself. The animation alone could not do this, yes we can see the leaves twirling, but to hear the music along with it is what shows us feelings of autumn; the feelings they want us to feel. This is what makes a lot of Nisekoi:\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scenes because how would we know how to feel if not for the music and the lighting and flow of the animation? Without it, the show is nothing more than a manga slideshow.\n\n##__Conclusion__##\n\nYes Nisekoi: certainly has faults as an anime plotwise and characterwise. The plot tries to be organized but ends up being just as disorganized as the first season and the characters are easily overshadowed by Chitoge herself leaving much to be desired from the other characters. What makes the anime worth a watch is seeing Chitoge grow as a character and seeing actual romance in Nisekoi that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t outrageous or unbelievable. There are some outlandish moments of course; but there is still a suspension of belief this time around. Coupled with the beautiful visuals and lovely sound it is well worth if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking to finish up the rest of the adaptations or just want something you can make your guilty pleasure that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that bad and isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that good either."}, {"id": 2086, "score": 60, "body": "~~~__Conveying Emotions Through Visuals__~~~\n~~~__(Warning: Contains Spoilers)__~~~\n\n~~~img420(https://68.media.tumblr.com/55ce34327564843e8ddcb0bcdd8d004b/tumblr_okgz76b7IR1w1e3rso8_540.png)~~~\n\nFor three decades, Studio Ghibli has enthralled people with their fantastical narratives, hand-drawn animation, memorable characters, and depiction of emotions. Sadly, _When Marnie Was There_ marked the end of an era for a studio which was home to the likes of Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata, as Studio Ghibli is on an indefinite hiatus from feature length films. Amidst all the grand castles, whimsical creatures, and gutsy female heroines, is a more subdued tale that is about an introverted girl dealing with her inner problems. In its story and in its characters, _When Marnie Was There_ is different from what Ghibli normally produces. What it does retain, however, is the studio's incredible ability to depict human emotions through the use of visuals.\n\n<hr style=\"height:3px; border:none; color:rgb(60,90,180); background-color:rgb(60,90,180);\">\n\n__Story:__\nStories of characters creating an imaginary friend in order to deal with their psychological problems is an all too familiar one. Often enough, imaginary characters are products of a protagonist's need for a friend. It is their need for someone who can understand them and guide them. _When Marnie Was There_ adds a twist to this by turning the story into a mystery, but it never really presents itself as a mystery. According to Alfred Hitchcock, mysteries are an \"intellectual process\", but  _When Marnie Was There_ does not focus on the intellectual process. Instead, it focuses primarily on the friendship between Anna and Marnie. It is best to suspend one's critical or analytical thinking as the story goes on because it's not really much of a mystery. \n\n~~~img420(https://media.giphy.com/media/PlG5EiBjlciRi/giphy.gif)~~~\n\nThe friendship between Anna and Marnie is an interesting one. There are tensions and misunderstandings, but the friendship between the two is so strong that it may be interpreted by some people as a romantic relationship. The film is not without its faults because it tries to be two things at once, and the pacing of the narrative is quite slow so things never turn as complex or deeply-layered as they seem. As the film progresses, blurred lines between reality and fantasy become more imminent, particularly in the second half of the film. Whilst this blurring of reality and fantasy can happen to people who have psychological problems like Anna, the execution or approach could have been handled better. Often enough, viewers may have to interpret what is being shown to them because of the fact that information is withheld. This means that the film can get too mysterious or puzzling for its own good. If you take away the supernatural element, then it seems like an odd story about a girl consistently hallucinating and passing out in different places. Although there are hints and foreshadowing on the eventual plot twist, the film's climax is just simply an exposition dump, but can nonetheless, hit you as something that is emotionally strong.\n\n~~~img420(https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mwJM2wkquyc/V4rda7Toh0I/AAAAAAAAxyw/ZZm5tYc3nOkHJa_g8cPCLPV6W2n4BmYGgCCo/s640/vlcsnap-00041.png)~~~\n\n _When Marnie Was There_ deals with dark themes right from the onset of the film, but it never touches too deeply into them and instead, offers quick resolutions to the problems that are presented. It's not the best or most complex out there, but it is a story that is melancholic and poignant in beauty even for a film that is geared towards children.\n\n<hr style=\"height:3px; border:none; color:rgb(60,90,180); backgroundcolor:rgb(60,90,180);\">\n\n__Art and Animation:__\nIt is difficult to not be swept away by the beauty of this film. There is a bucolic beauty that comes with the landscapes, nostalgia in the town and architecture, and sublimity in the details of the environment and character expressions. _When Marnie Was There_ is such a picturesque film, that is brings not only the seaside town to life, but also the characters. From the onset of the film, we are already treated to the depiction of emotions through the movement of characters. Anna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s environment is one that is bustling with life, a place that does not befit a person who is dealing with her inner problems. There is a scene near the beginning of the film that I like where in Anna hops off the train and arrives at the seaside town. As the train behind Anna finally pulls away, we are revealed to a more quiet and subtle environment. A perfect transition where I think the animators did one hell of a job. The way the seaside town is presented is that it is made into a place of psychological healing. The characters and the setting blended very well together, giving off a feeling of realism. It is clear that the visuals were made to be the center of attention because it feels like a story on its own. There is not a literal need for dialogue or development in the emotional story that the visuals are trying to convey because it is being done with beautiful shots of moments and the natural setting.\n\n~~~img420(https://68.media.tumblr.com/20641478d14ae8e74544e3430d7c31d8/tumblr_okgz76b7IR1w1e3rso9_540.gif)~~~\n\nThere are misconceptions that the characters are presented with blandness, and that there is also a lack of subtlety to how expressions suddenly jump from neutral to astonished. There are moments when Anna smiles (usually around Marnie, who empathizes with her), but it has to be taken note of, that the protagonist is going through a rough time, so jumping from a neutral to an astonished face is normal. Studio Ghibli has in no way, mitigated their ability to bring their characters to life.

This is why I chose to express the sensation we feel in the coldness of water, and in smell and taste. In my films, I place emphasis on the re-creation of what we can feel with our senses. Dramatic expression is certainly one of animation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strengths, but I believe hand-drawn animation is particularly effective with films like Marnie that appeal to the senses. With hand-drawn animation we get to choose what we want to bring across to the viewer. We can effectively show wind blowing during a moving scene and such.

There wasn't a piece that really stood out in a scene or completely took over it because the main function of the music was to just simply be an accompaniment. To serve as a compliment so that it may further strengthen the feelings that were evoked by the setting. This is a good thing because like the visuals, the music evoked feelings of subtlety and poignancy. These feelings are all the more true for the theme; _Fine on the Outside_ by Priscilla Ahn. It is a beautiful song that was written back in 2005, but was never released because it is quite personal. The artist finally decided to release it along with the film because she saw herself in the protagonist; Anna. The sounds for this film were also pretty good. I thought that the seiyuus for Anna and Marnie did great, and the sound effects blended well with the atmosphere to create a sense of realism.\n\n~~~img420(https://66.media.tumblr.com/8d4085de545a6a6c12ee7ad2515e6cb5/tumblr_o16klohFgA1uer6cyo1_500.gif)~~~\n\n<hr style=\"height:3px; border:none; color:rgb(60,90,180); background-color:rgb(60,90,180);\">\n\n__Characters:__\nAnna is certainly different from many other female protagonists of Ghibli films. She is lonely, she represses her feelings, and she is in anguish. Anna is a representation of the dark emotions that  a kid can feel and go through. Anna even keeps saying throughout the film that she hates herself which hints at the possibility of suicidal intentions if she had stayed in the city. The playground scene at the beginning of the film is a very good one because it is embedded with meaning, telling us what Anna is like. In the scene, we are shown children playing in the playground and students in groups, but Anna is all alone. We see her drawing something out of fantasy, and it shows that both drawing and creating fantastical things eases her. It gives her relief even it may be a temporary form of relief. The scene gets followed by a teacher asking if he could see Anna's drawing. Anna is hesitant to show her drawing at first, but slowly decides to show and handover the drawing. As she is about to give the drawing, the teacher gets distracted by a kid who is seen crying, so he decides to head over to the scene and leave Anna behind. It's a fleeting moment that shows Anna's shyness, her hesitance to accept help, and her repression of feelings. \n\n~~~img420(https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8E_p1DnSCGw/V4rdlwHa_-I/AAAAAAAAxy4/qwuhemrYejYzTsrCRerYWlSvCcbr2si3ACCo/s640/vlcsnap-00078.png)~~~\n\nMarnie is an ambiguous character that is the opposite of Anna. She is a manifestation of what Anna desires to be. The fact that her being a ghost or hallucination is never made clear, but it adds to the level of mysticism or ambiguity which she has. At its core, however, _When Marnie Was There_ is about the friendship between Anna and Marnie. It is a very strong friendship that can come off as being a romance even though it is not. Their friendship is one that is heart-warming because many moments between the two characters are handled with subtlety. You won't get a complex character catharsis, but there remains a fact that this is a mature film for children."}, {"id": 2094, "score": 50, "body": "\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe reason does not matter.

It started serialization in Square Enix's Gangan Joker in March 2010. An anime television series adaptation of the main series premiered in Japan in July 2014. The story of the anime focuses on Tatsumi, a young villager that travels to the Capital, to become a soldier and to earn enough money to save his village. When Tatsumi reaches his destination point, he finds out that the country he wants to serve is rotten; however, one man cannot do anything against the whole country. Thankfully, Tatsumi encounters a group of assassin known as Night Raid. That group tries to assassinate all rotten politicians that do nothing but torture people, and to rebuild their country as a place, where all people have the right to live. Will the assassin group called Night Raid, together with Tatsumi, be able to change their rotten country? Find out the answer now. \n\nWhile the story line sounds intriguing, it has too many flaws to be good. To be more precise, it has three main flaws: it is rushed, it relies too much on death, and it is unclear whether the main focus of this series is comedy, drama, or action. Not only the anime suffers these three flaws, but also it does not explain enough: Akame ga Kill! does show characters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 backstories, but, at the same time, they are so short and sometimes do not make sense at all. The only explanation that I have is that the creators of Akame ga Kill! did not have enough resources, and so they decided to omit some scenes and to make the story of this series more rushed. All In all, this is one of the weakest parts on this series. \n\nThe animation and sound are, perhaps, the reasons why this anime is actually watchable. But again, the animation is average and I would never call it unique. Yes, character designs are not bad and, yes, action scenes are fine, but it is still not enough to say that the animation is good. Some scenes are extremely beautiful, but some are just ugly. Anyway, luck of budget is obvious even here. The sound is more or less good: not only the ED and OP themes are good, but also the OST is very enjoyable. Also, good voice actors compensate for pale characters. \n\nThe characters are,  not that bad and I would highly recommend you to only think about characters and about characters only, forget about the story. Anyway, let us discuss the characters. I will start with Akame (anime is called Akame ga Kill!, by the way). Akame is one of the main characters of this series, but despite having her name in the anime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s title, the anime does not pay enough attention to her persona; it does show us that she is always hungry, quite, and calm, her backstory is okay and it also makes sense, but it will be shown a bit too late. What I am trying to say is that when we first see Akame, the anime heavily implies that she will be the main protagonist of this series, this anime is called Akame ga Kill!, after all, but, for some reason, Tatsumi receives more screen time than Akame. The next character I would like to discuss is Chelsea. Chelsea is also a member of Night Raid, she is extremely beautiful, and her cheerful personality helps to make this anime less dramatic. However, the main problem with her character is that she does not do anything for the story, she is absolutely useless. She is a member of the Night Raid and this organization is the main focus of this anime, so, um, why not pay more attention to Chelsea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character? The next character is Esdeath, the only Akame Ga Kill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best girl. Not only she is interesting, but also she might be the only character you will have faith in. Yes, she might be called a plain villain, but her actions and her character overall, MAKE SENSE.  AND finally the last character I would like to discuss is Seryuu. While she is annoying sometimes, she is one of the characters that I like and you will probably like, as well. She does what she finds important to do and to achieve her goals, she is ready literally for everything. \n\nAnyway, I would not say that the cast of this series is extremely bad; it is average, but not bad: some characters do not receive enough development, some characters are absolutely useless, and so on. Again, the characters and the story are not the problem of this anime, the only problem of this anime is that it did not have enough resources. \n\nAll in all, if you still have not seen Akame ga Kill yet, I would highly recommend you to either read the manga, or watch the anime. Of course, reading the manga will the best case scenario, it is just MUCH-MUCH better, but still, the anime is not that bad. Yes, it is far from being good, but just do not expect something good: be ready for an average drama with some action elements."}, {"id": 2102, "score": 50, "body": "Overall, Strike Witches is a mediocre show. Gonzo, the studio that developed it, needed a show with sales, and it shows. Looking back, Strike Witches is almost certainly a half-baked idea, a universe with little to no development and no real idea of what it wants to be. It started as a series of sketches and drawings by Fumikane, a world imagined at a surface level. Gonzo is more than happy to do the bare minimum expansion of the world needed to start a show, and it's quite apparent.\n\nThe first half of the series is largely over the top fanservice. It banks on the sheer audacity of the fanservice to entice audiences and generate buzz. If you took a shot of your favorite liquor every time there was an egregious panty--or rather, crotch--shot, you'd be dead. The girls' lack of proper pants is what Strike Witches is most known for, and though it's oddly cute and slightly lewd in the source drawings and concepts, it's particularly strange in a moving anime. Episode 7 is most guilty of the lewd pandering, opening with one of said crotch shots and embarking on a ludicrous story that only serves to bring the nudity to the 11th level.\n\nStill, there are occasional glimpses of a good story. Sanya's character-driven episode, though filled with fanservice, is well done, and hints at what might have been if the show had decided to take itself more seriously. The last half of the season, about five episodes or so, introduces actual plot lines and drama, with characters revealing their pasts and dealing with developments that actually involve the setting. There's genuine interest generated, and it didn't take fanservice to do so. I often wonder what this series would have been like if it had decided to use characters or plot to drive it along, instead of unapologetic fanservice.\n\nIn the end, Strike Witches definitely feels like a show that wasn't thought out. It has very conflicting tones, what with the heavy emphasis on a continent on the brink of eradication, a hopeless war where mighty naval ships and mechanic might are seen as completely ineffective. At the same time, the girls live lighthearted lives, lewding each other in a carefree, almost comical manner. It doesn't know what story it wants to tell, or even if it wants to tell a story at all, given that it takes 8 episodes (more than half the series) to get rolling. The lack of heart and effort, combined with the studio's greed, really hurts Strike Witches. \n\nI just wish they hadn't managed to mess up the golden combination of cute girls, magic, aliens, and 1940s tech."}, {"id": 2120, "score": 60, "body": "~~~_\"Berserk: Conviction\"_~~~\n\n~~~img(http://i.imgur.com/bW7JrwZ.jpg)~~~\n\n__BERSERK 2016 IS AN ADAPTATION OF A LATER ARC OF THE MANGA.

ADDITIONALLY, THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN VARYING SPOILERS FOR THE EVENTS THAT LEAD UP TO BERSERK 2016.__\n\n__~~actually what am I even saying, Berserk 2016's opening itself spoils the entire Golden Age right out of the gate~~__\n\n___\n#Introduction#\n___\"I-I-It's better than nothing...?\"___\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/Hrd7ZQX.jpg) ~~~\nForewarning: This is going to be long. This will probably be more of a dissection of all of Berserk 2016's flaws (what I consider to be flaws anyways) than a typical review.\n\nSo, before we get the ceremonial beating of the dead horse underway (assuming you've seen any other reviews or conversations about this anime), let's have a little bit of background on the Berserk series itself. \n\n[Berserk](http://anilist.co/manga/30002/Berserk) by [Kentaro Miura](http://anilist.co/staff/96868/KentaroMiura) has received several adaptations before this new one.  There was the [1997 anime](http://anilist.co/anime/33/Berserk) which was done by the [Oriental Light and Magic ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLM,_Inc.) studio who that year had also begun the original Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon anime. Berserk 1997 was entirely 2D of course (several but not all of the action scenes went the still image route) and left out a couple of story elements, and focused mostly on the manga's \"Golden Age\" arc while still including a sliver to hint of things that would come after that arc. No second season directly followed Berserk 1997. Though, there were two video games made in [1999](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_of_the_Berserk:_Guts%27_Rage) and then in [2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berserk:_Millennium_Falcon_Hen_Seima_Senki_no_Sh%C5%8D). Then, there were the [2012](http://anilist.co/anime/10218/BerserkOugonJidaihenIHaounoTamago) [movies](http://anilist.co/anime/12113/BerserkOugonJidaihenIIDoldreyKouryaku) [done](http://anilist.co/anime/12115/BerserkOugonJidaihenIIIKourin) by [Studio 4\u00c2\u00b0C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_4%C2%B0C). The movies, unlike the 1997 series, were a mixture of 2D and CG. Prior to Berserk 2016, the movies actually regularly received a lot of flak as some of the CG scenes just looked... off, or subpar to say the least. In addition, while the movies, which focused entirely on the Golden Age arc, included a couple of things the original 1997 anime excluded but ended up excluding an entire subplot and other scenes that the 1997 anime DID cover.\n\nFinally, we arrive to Berserk 2016 by the studio [Millepensee](http://anilist.co/studio/6073/Millepensee), who has done several Teekyuu (tennis gag series) seasons and two spin-offs. They're the ones doing Berserk 2016 and Berserk 2017. Whatever, it's fine (I actually like Teekyuu). Point is nineteen years later, we receive a new Berserk anime with Guts, the protagonist of Berserk, but finally in his \"Black Swordsman\" years (the period that chronologically follows the events of the Golden Age). They included a confirmation of Berserk 2017 with the final episode of this. So... is Berserk 2016 good then? Or is it at the very least, watchable?\n\nLet's just dive in, shall we?\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/twyyBSE.jpg)~~~\n___\n#The Black Swordsman (Or Not?)#\n___\"The manga is better!!!!1!\"___\n\nOur protagonist is Guts, a man missing an arm (an iron prosthetic which also serves as a cannon replacing it) and an eye, with an enormous slab of iron resembling a sword on his back. With a bloodied and dark past, he wanders the land slaughtering inhuman monsters referred to most commonly as Apostles. On a dark night, he steps into a dingy tavern in which some bandits are tormenting a little tied up elf named ~~annoying bug~~ Puck. He brutally kills all of them in the matter of seconds, indirectly saving Puck.\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/vntGEek.jpg)~~~\n\nThat is both the start of the manga as well as Berserk 2016 (actually, rewatching it, Guts doesn't kill any of them in the tavern unlike in the manga and the 1997 series' version). However, once the tavern scene ends in Berserk 2016, things sort of go off the rails for a little bit. I don't wish to continuously compare this to the manga, but at least this much has to be addressed as it's one of the largest issues I have with this anime as a whole. As this was the first Berserk anime actually about what happened after the Golden Age, there were certain expectations.  A new Berserk anime featuring Guts the Black Swordsman, out for revenge slaying the Apostles who are servants of the beings that wronged him, the God Hand. One of the promo art images even was from a scene from the particularly dark sub-arc of Conviction (the arc Berserk 2016 completely focuses on) called Lost Children.\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/HBDb8ev.png)~~~\n\nWhile it turned out that Lost Children wasn't included, they did include a tree monster from it thrown clumsily into the first episode of Berserk 2016 because Guts needed something other than humans and skeletons to fight. The Black Swordsman arc (the very first part of the Berserk manga before even the Golden Age), was slimmed down to the tavern scene and the chariot scene. The three fleshed out full Apostles that Guts had near death battles that were more like struggles and an outright face to face encounter with the God Hand, the antagonists of the series who outright ruined Guts' life, from these two arcs was replaced with a later filler episode where Guts fights a CG Pig Apostle (to be fair, Miura himself wrote that episode and the Pig Apostle is actually elsewhere from the manga) instead. \n\nThere's supposed to be a two year gap (Guts spent these two years basically doing nothing but fighting monsters every day) between the end of the Golden Age arc and where Berserk 2016 starts. The Black Swordsman arc first establishes Guts as this Black Swordsman character, this haunted brooding and violent individual whose entire day to day life is basically a struggle to just remain alive due to the spirits and Apostles that are haunting and chasing him as they're literally out for every single drop of his blood. Then the Golden Age arc happens explaining Guts' past and how he became this way, and Lost Children serves as a sort of transition back to \"Guts the Black Swordsman.\".\n\nRemoving Lost Children and gutting most of the Black Swordsman arc is equivalent to outright removing like a key jenga piece. It just all crumbles, and instead, you basically have: Guts fights bandits, Guts fights skeletons, Guts fights tree monster, and that's the first episode done. To be honest, I honestly contemplated stopping with the first episode... but I didn't. The second episode just outright goes to right after Lost Children ends aka, the main part of the Conviction arc. Thankfully, they did... the rest of Conviction about as well as they could have (as far as the story/writing goes) in, you know, ten episodes excluding the first and the Pig Apostle episode which is mostly filler.\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/U56eFd4.jpg)~~~\n\n___\n\n#2D vs CG#\n___\"There'll never be a 2D Berserk anime ever again let every snippet of 2D we give you be SALT IN THE WOUNDS\"___\nHave to get this one out of the way, as it's the \"low hanging fruit\" of Berserk 2016's several flaws. The movies mixed 2D and CG. But it wasn't as if their CG was completely terrible (Berserk 2016's is, hooray!), or as if a majority of all three movies were entirely CG. The opening of Berserk 2016 is essentially a reversed reflection of the show itself. 90% of the opening is of course 2D, but then there's the last couple of seconds where it switches to CG Guts swinging his sword, the Dragonslayer around. Those couple of seconds of CG Guts swinging his sword? That's the show. The 2D opening might look nice but if you pause it... a lot of it just looks... either silly or wrong. Also, there are flashbacks sprinkled throughout the entire twelve episodes and it's basically the same 2D animation as the opening.\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/l0UrVAY.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/dlAcAq8.png)~~~\n\nAlso, I'm not even going to go any further into it than this, but as can be seen in the image on the right, Casca (Berserk's female lead character) is white in both the opening as well as any 2D flashback scene that has her in it. Casca of course is not white in the manga/97 anime/2012 movies/games, but that's not my issue with it. Not the main one, anyways. She's white in the 2D portions of the show (they did actually fix her in the opening like around episode 10 or 11 I believe), but then ISN'T white in the CG portion of the show. If the constant switching back from 2D to CG wasn't jarring or irritating enough as it was...\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/YDZIKEp.png)~~~\n\nBut it of course gets worse. As well as the 2D flashback scenes, or the scenes when Guts pictures something in his head like the God Hand, there are further sprinklings of 2D here and there. All action scenes are of course CG. Guts is CG 80% of the time (even if he's just walking, running, or talking) but when he makes an angry face or chops up a rabbit, cooks it, and eats it, he's 2D. Some of the minor supporting characters or background characters, they're usually consistently 2D (although some are still just CG) as long as they don't appear a lot/aren't in any action scenes. Mozgus, one of the antagonists of the Conviction arc, a couple of his more notable moments are in 2D. Oh, did I mention sometimes 2D and CG characters are on the screen at the same time right next to each other?\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/Oqtjzha.jpg)~~~\n\n\"I want to be 2D.\"\n\"I want to be CG.\"\n\"I want to be 2D AND CG.\"\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/ZRJInBa.jpg)~~~\n_~~~\"Push the panic button, the poorly done 2D and CG worlds are colliding!\"\n~~~_\nLove the 2012 movies or hate them, there was at least a sort of consistency about them. There definitely wasn't full 2D and CG characters sharing the screen together at the same time. In comparison, [Kingdom's](http://anilist.co/manga/46765/Kingdom) [anime](http://anilist.co/anime/12031/Kingdom) started out ENTIRELY CG but very gradually, I think over half the way through the first season or with the start of the second season, there was a point where conversation scenes/non-action scenes basically started to be consistently 2D. I'm not sure if that would work quite as well for Berserk as it's more on the action side (I remember Kingdom having entire episodes dedicated to the politics and etc), but I think it'd still be better than... well, what we got.\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/kERIY6M.png)~~~\n\nWell okay, but what about the action sequences? I'll tell you about the action sequences. Guts punches people with his iron hand. Guts swings the Dragonslayer slowly and decimates his enemies. Guts shoots his crossbow on his iron hand. Also, almost every single really gruesome scene in the action scenes are either toned down or just wrong in the CG. \n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/psGayGr.png)~~~\n\nAdditionally, maybe this is just me on this one but, I don't really care for how they made blood look either. Overall, I think there's like two action scenes I still actually liked despite the CG that I can also still remember after watching, but they're the two major fights of the entire arc (technically, they're both just different parts of the same fight). \n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/mHGDioH.jpg)~~~\n\nAlso (it may seem like I'm now just purposely looking for things to complain about but this is just how Berserk 2016 to me is), I couldn't really stand how Casca looked in CG throughout the entire thing. I don't know why I got used to CG Guts but not CG Casca, she just doesn't look right to me even now (which is bad considering one of the major points of this entire arc is Guts going to try and save Casca).\n\n_I will admit, however, I actually did like how the Dragonslayer looked. Though, I think that's really the only positive thing I can think of as far as the CG goes._\n\n___\n\n#Missing Pieces/Who Was This Made For#\n___\"mfw making another section about comparisons to the manga\"___\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/uq2wer6.jpg)~~~\n\nThe overall reception to Berserk 2016 from fans of the manga (this includes myself!) has been... lukewarm at best to say the very least. The most positive thing I've seen is basically \"It's better than nothing\" or \"a bad anime is better than no anime!\" and I do get that to an extent but. I don't think this was the Berserk season 2 they imagined getting after 19 years! But you know, there's another crowd to consider here. Those poor Berserk fans who perhaps just really don't like manga who really liked the 97 series/2012 movies.\n\nHow does Berserk 2016 hold up for them? Well, I'd imagine not well. I don't see how they'd even know what was going on without at least a general knowledge of the parts they skipped (Black Swordsman/Lost Children). Because it's not as if those arcs never happened in Berserk 2016 world. They just didn't do them.\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/KCYk5Ic.jpg)~~~\n\nThey gutted the section of Black Swordsman when Guts got that Behelit, but in the Conviction chapters they were adapting, Farnese makes a comment on it (and also they had to include it because it'll no doubt be a important plot device later on in the manga). It's never shown or brought up again through the rest of the show, but I'm sure strictly anime/movies only fans were confused as to why Guts had it considering they know what that other Behelit did...\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/uSRePkf.jpg)~~~\n\nI already talked a decent amount about how much they axed Guts' character development and you know, him turning into the Black Swordsman. From I think episode four and on, it's already at the point where Guts is realizing his mistakes and trying to turn back from the destructive path he had wholly chosen to walk down. Resulting in a talking dog made of darkness taking permanent residence within his head/mind. The Beast of Darkness' actual introduction was of course in Lost Children. Skipped!\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/ykQGpNf.jpg)~~~\n\nGodo (the blacksmith character who created Guts' giant sword, the Dragonslayer) is a tricky one. I know for sure he appeared and his parts were there in the 97 anime. But he didn't appear in the movies though his house and daughter and etc did. That being said, I'm including him in this anyways because Berserk 2016 actually had a chance and could have totally shown Godo's explanation for why he even created the Dragonslayer (which is seen as this insane and crazy impractical weapon by every other human in the entire series because no other human would be able to use it as Guts does), but opted to only show Guts' first Apostle kill with it and only very briefly. So yeah I guess Guts just got a really big sword for no reason other than big sword once the Golden Age ended!\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/fFr6bYK.jpg)~~~\n\nPuck. Oh, Puck. Black Swordsman Guts is supposed to be in this spiral of madness and violence and not want to be around anyone other than the Apostles he brutally kills. Yet, in Berserk 2016, Guts' relationship with this elf is essentially slimmed down to finding him slightly annoying and then just choosing not to care when he continues to follow him. In the manga, Guts was openly hostile towards him and probably wouldn't have put up with his presence long enough for him to get used to it if it wasn't for the fact elf dust basically very quickly restores wounds (another detail mostly brushed over in Berserk 2016.)\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/YlctUIq.jpg)~~~\n\nNosferatu Zodd. Obviously, neither the 97 anime or the 2012 movies cut him as after all, he's sort of an important character. However, there's a certain scene in Conviction that Berserk 2016 could have included (but didn't) to explain why all of a sudden he just appears literally out of nowhere in episode 11. It would also have explained why his face is scarred/his Apostle form is missing a horn. Even in the manga, the only time he speaks in this arc is that scene which they didn't include. Should note that the other Berserk adaptation of 2016, Berserk Musou (Berserk game done with the gameplay o the Dynasty Warriors games) actually included this [scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_Ju_K4OSw0) and it was actually good! Maybe they did it on purpose? \"Oh cool, now an action scene with a CG Zodd! I guess...?\"\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/cai1DwH.jpg)~~~\n\nAll of these so far could be argued to be minor or only things that would annoy fans of the manga. But this one... it's a huge, huge flaw. The \"misshaped creature\" you see above plays a huge role throughout Conviction/Berserk 2016 and Berserk as a whole. Despite being a key piece of Conviction, one that is integral to the arc and repeatedly shows up throughout it (and elsewhere in Berserk), they never show or explain its origin. The 2012 movies, while they covered a bit farther than the 97 anime, did not make it to the part that explains this creature. If you already know at least a bit about the rest of Berserk, you can probably easily infer what it is on your own. I was maybe willing to give them a pass on this one due to the nature of the scene in question, but Berserk Musou (which was only just recently released in Japan), actually includes this sort of important scene as well. (Not linking this one because it's an outright major spoiler).\n\nIf you're going to cut essentially two entire arcs (you go from volume 1 with episode 1 to the end of volume 16 of the manga with episode 2), you're probably going to end up losing/confusing the fans who really liked either the 97 anime or the movies that just haven't read the manga for whatever reason. The manga fans on the other hand are going to be annoyed that two arcs were cut so they could just rush and get to the Tower of Conviction stuff. Or be annoyed when they see Isidoro in the Black Swordsman tavern, or the Lost Children tree monster without actually getting Lost Children. Or that there's a filler episode when they're watching a Berserk anime period.\n\nPoint is, it all adds up after a while!\n\n___\n\n#The Anime of a Thousand CLANGS and HAI YOs#\n___\"How many easy targets does this anime have???\"___\n\nShould I even bother (this is probably the most memed thing about Berserk 2016)? Sure, why not. I've come this far (and if you're still reading, so have you for some reason). The \"clangs\" were actually a problem in Berserk 2016 right from episode one. Not only is it the same exact \"clang\" over and over again, but there are \"clangs\" for places where there shouldn't be. Cutting a possessed corpse of a little girl in half should not result in a \"clang\" noise. Especially when it's supposed to be this dramatic dark moment. It comes off as almost comical (I recall actually laughing when it happened) and this was before the tree monster came out and I almost quit at episode one. The \"clangs\" never leave after that point, and I believe when Guts is fighting spirits or ghosts (ETHEREAL BEINGS), even then it happens. \n\nI understand that they wanted to make the Dragonslayer's impacts sound \"heavy\" but it basically sounds like Guts is instead swinging around a gigantic frying pan. It doesn't help that the one and only episode from Berserk 97 that does a portion of the Black Swordsman stuff has a Guts swinging [a Dragonslayer that doesn't clang.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11hauEzyQC8) Actually, most of the sound effects of Berserk 2016 are kind of... like even Guts' arm crossbow is unnecessarily loud. Loud noises, the sound of like iron scraping against something (even when Guts just moves his fake/metal arm), and CLANGS.\n\nYou're assaulting my hearing as well? _Why?_\n\nMoving on, one of the best things about Berserk 1997 was the OST which was done entirely by [Susumu Hirasawa](http://anilist.co/staff/100750/SusumuHirasawa). The soundtrack for Berserk 2016 was... bad is a bit too harsh, but forgettable sounds about right. Of what I can recall: there was the opening \"Inferno\" of course which I was actually a fan of, \"Blood and Guts\" but that was also in the movies so, \"Ash Crow\" by Susumu Hirasawa at the very end of the final episode, and also by Hirasawa... \"Hai Yo.\"\n\nIf you watch Berserk 2016 all the way through, you're going to be sick of hearing \"Hai Yo\" by the time you're done. Let me get this out of the way, Hirasawa's music is great. \"Hai Yo\" is pretty good, it's not my favorite Hirasawa song (it isn't even my favorite Berserk Hirasawa song), that's not the point. Let me preface this with this. If you've heard any track from Berserk 97's OST, it's probably \"Forces\". I mean, Hirasawa's done three different versions of it for a reasons. It played for the \"next episode\" previews and partially for one battle in one episode of Berserk 97.\n\nBerserk 2016 uses \"Hai Yo\" over, and over, and over again. Yes, it's good, but if you use it every other scene in which Guts swings the Dragonslayer... it loses its impact or even worse, becomes annoying. Especially if the rest of the OST save a couple of other tracks is bland...\n\n\"Hai Yo is playing again. I guess Guts is doing his thing!\"\n~~~\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/coAHgvS.jpg)~~~\n___\n#Conclusion#\n\n_I didn't feel like making a completely separate section for this alone but, they also really went crazy with the camera/camera angles. To an unneeded extent._\n\nMy goal in writing all of this was to go over all of the things that I think made this not work for fans of the manga, fans of the past adaptations, or just in general. It may seem like this review is almost entirely negative (it is!), but I should note I overall was still capable of enjoying at least parts of it. Which is why I have it set at like a __6 out of 10__. What of the Conviction arc is still there is reasonably okay (once you get used to the CG...), but I still wouldn't recommend Berserk 2016's version being the first you experience. If you really just don't like reading manga but liked the past adaptations or want to watch them and include this, just proceed and take it with a grain of salt.\n\n~~if you're a gaming person Berserk Musou will be coming to the US for PS4, Vita, and Steam in February 2017~~\n\nAnyways... in closing, I hope Berserk 2017 ends up being better than this. Not terribly optimistic, though. Regardless, I'm not looking forwards to the scores of memes that will compare Berserk 2017 and the 2004 PS2 game side by side (since they're both about the same arc).\n\n~~~img(http://i.imgur.com/Oeyo3Ko.jpg)~~~"}, {"id": 2127, "score": 60, "body": "Terror in Resonance is a show that looks promising at first glance. It has impressive visuals, nice music and a theme that could be interesting. It then completely fails to deliver.\n\nThe protagonists are supposed to be terrorists. Why, you ask? Well, because they bomb places, and that's a terrorist thing to do, right? But for all that, they're careful not to let a single person get injured, much less killed, do little to inspire terror, and neither do they mean to. The \"bombing places\" bit is completely irrelevant to anything and serves no actual purpose.\n\nAs for the characters themselves, we have Nine and Twelve, who have a generic institution orphan backstory that's never elaborated on, Five who fluctuates between a friend who the former two failed to save and a girl who was an evil mastermind before an age of 5 (not that staying at the institution makes any sense in that case, but the show really pushes for it), Lisa who is, once again, irrelevant and could be skipped entirely (they had to introduce a large obvious weakness to balance out the the protagonists' prodigious luck), Shibazaki the obscure riddle-solver who's connected to the whole business by yet another skippable thread that's never elaborated on (you'll notice there's a lot of not being elaborated on yet being introduced regardless going on this anime), the generic \"above the law\" American guy (yes, Watanabe, we understand that you're trying to send a message) and a bunch of sidekicks who are there to fill up the space. I feel the need to stress that none of them have any real character building, remaining one-trait characters even as the big reveal rolls in.\n\nThe storyline is nearly nonexistent. The characters spend the time until Five's introduction essentially playing around with the tool called plot convenience, like the police's security system server having an intentional backdoor webpage that can be accessed from anywhere with no one the wiser in open access. Then Five's schizophrenic back-and-forth chase begins as quickly as it ends with Lisa's captures (yes, plural), and before you realize it, the ending happens.\n\nSpeaking of the ending, that's got to be the best thing about the show. It takes everything accumulated over the 10 episodes (and precious little it is) and tosses it right out of the window, doing a complete 180 from the entire show's mood. \"I got you, Nine! Guess I'll kill myself now, bye. Oh, and that orphan-fueled research program you've been learning about for the entire show? Pfft, off to the background it goes. Also, let's knock Japan back to the Stone Age for the lols, we're dying anyway.\" The supposedly evil Americans are the most reasonable faction of those that matter, so yeah.\n\nAll in all, Zankyou no Terror completely fails to drag you in as every story thread that ever begins is immediately and brutally murdered, and the conclusion shows up out of nowhere and takes up half an episode where three minutes would've sufficed. The show is only watchable because of the art and music."}, {"id": 2140, "score": 55, "body": "Many things that people like to say about 91 Days to give it the buzz that it's had among the more \"elitist\" community of anime watchers is just how different and refreshing the series is as a whole. I really don't deny that fact, because to put it simply, it is a fact that the series has a lot of things not commonly seen in other series', and also doesn't have a lot of things that are commonly seen in other series'. In the world of modern anime, I do admit that it's extremely refreshing to see an anime series with no lolis, moe, or fanservice and instead have an extra high dose of history; a series that takes place in 1920s America, during the Prohibition Era, and is about a child who grows up to become a gangster simply for the sake of revenge. And as I said, 91 Days doesn't at ALL fail in the regard of being different, fresh, original, and refreshing. Where it fails is just about everywhere else.\n\nWhen it comes to just about ANY series that uses revenge as its main focal point, you're almost always going to be sure of exactly where it's going to go simply because of how much plot armor is involved in any revenge story. The main goal of any story that uses revenge as its plot center is to create a fair number of unexpected twists and turns that, ultimately, create something that you didn't expect. Unfortunately, as is the case with about 95% of all revenge stories, 91 Days failed to do that and how it ended up was exactly how I predicted it from the very second episode. The only \"twist\" that the series had in its entire run was with the premise itself; it really didn't make itself seem like a revenge story from the very beginning, and it wasn't until the end of the first episode that we actually learned that it was one.\n\nThat's pretty much all 91 Days is. Everything is predictable and nothing is all that unique. The story fails to have any extreme amount of depth to it that makes you think, \"huh, this is a pretty freaking good series.\" Instead, it relies on the fact that its original and refreshing instead of trying to put more effort into its writing. There are no twists, no turns, and no unexpected happenings throughout the entire series. There's nothing compelling, gripping, or anything that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire series. Just about everything about it is predictable, and that's basically what the story itself was meant to be. It's not hard to tell by around episode three, or possibly four if you aren't too great at catching onto things quick, that the series was never at all written to be anything with a lot of depth or flavor beyond its premise, setting, and presentation.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems like everything about the series falls into this kind of hole as well. While they aren't ever really presented as anything too deep either, even from the beginning when everything else felt original and fresh, the characters themselves fail in many regards as well simply because of how flat they feel. There's literally no development for the main character, and even though you kind of expect that (because how exactly should you develop a character who's out to kill everybody and only has revenge on his mind without completely changing him?), it still is sad to be basically watching cardboard cutouts interact with each other the entire series. The writers try their best to hide this by constantly introducting new characters that are never seen again by the end of the episode they're introduced in, but there really is no hiding the fact that none of the characters really mean anything in the long run. At the very least, I feel that the writers should've at least took the time to flesh out the villains a bit more, so we could at least feel for the main character and his decisions to want to kill all of the people he was targeting. If that were the case, at least we could've drawn even a minor connection to the main character, as opposed to feeling absolutely nothing for him, and not even being able to enjoy him as a well-written character simply because he wasn't one. To sum it all up, the character interactions and relations in 91 Days just felt extremely forced, like the characters were only there for the sake of the plot and not for the sake of being characters, like these kinds of people would never exist in reality and are just the fuel for forced storytelling.\n\nNow, is 91 Days a total failure? If you've looked at my overall score for the series, you should know that I don't believe it to be a complete and utter failure. The fact of the matter is, 91 Days does actually maintain a sense of enjoyment throughout the entire series, and there was rarely ever a time where I felt bored of watching it or ever felt reluctant to flip it on and watch the new episode whenever it became available online after airing. It is to say that even things without deep stories that fail in every regard to being a well-written character-driven tale can still be enjoyable, which I like to look at pretty much every single Disney-Pixar movie released in the past 5 years as proof of that. Regardless, I do consider it a fact that 91 Days is, at the very least, an enjoyable background-watch for when you're focusing more time onto other things, whether it be work in real life, a massive amount of airing series', or whatever else. It definitely is something that you can enjoy on the side of everything else, flipping it on to watch an episode or two every few days just as a bit of relaxation from all the chaos. In that regard, 91 Days is an excellent series just because of how well it succeeds at all of that.\n\nRegardless, what can also be said is that 91 Days certainly DOES have a lot more buzz than a majority of \"unpopular\" and/or non-mainstream series' from 2016. The fact of the matter is, even though it wasn't enough for me, there are plenty of people who truly do believe that the fact that it's new, original, and refreshing compared to 90% of all modern anime is more than enough to justify it being considered a good series. Again, it really just depends on how you think about a series that fails a lot while succeeding in one thing that could be considered crucial or could be considered next to nothing in terms of how big of a deal it is to you. That's your own decision to make.\n\n\nAnd to wrap everything up with a quick overview, 91 Days is a series that succeeds very well in being an enjoyable tale that is refreshing in almost every way possible just because of how it tells a tale in a very unique, mature setting that includes no lolis, moe, or fanservice. However, despite that, it fails in almost every other regard. So, if you're able to go into it not expecting a ton from it, and just expecting raw enjoyment quality without a lot of superb writing and effort, you will certainly enjoy it quite a bit (like I did). Otherwise, if you expect something amazing from it as you go into it, you'll likely be very disappointed. Watch at your own risk.\n\n\nCondensed scoring:\n\nMain 4: 90% of total score\nStory (45%) - Total score: 46/100\nCharacters (35%) - Total score: 38/100\nArt & Animation (15%) - Total score: 93/100\nSound (5%) - Total score: 97/100\n\nEnjoyment: 10% of total score\nEnjoyment (33.3% to each story, characters, and presentation) - Total score: 70/100\n\nFinal score (non-enjoyment weighted): 53/100\nFinal score (weighted): 55/100"}, {"id": 2154, "score": 50, "body": "[Warning: this review will contain vague, but consistent minor spoilers]\n\nAround 2008 or 2009, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember exactly, in a decently warm Saturday, I went back home and decided to check out the site from where I got my anime. The news that day was that they were able to upload Neon Genesis Evangelion, a 1995 TV series that was apparently a very influential piece of the Mecha genre. Intrigued by the description I decided to check out the title, completely blind. That was my introduction to the inevitability of Evangelion, possibly the most divisive anime ever made. \n\nBy the score you probably guessed already my stance in regards to the series: I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like Evangelion, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like it when I first watched, knowing little to nothing about it, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like now that I have better critical mindset. However, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not beyond admitting when the series does something right. I write these self-indulgent pieces called Reviews when I think I have something at least mildly interesting to say about the work and I believe I can give my 2 cents to the discussion in the fairest manner I can pull off. A little warning, though: discussing the most contemptuous points about Neon Genesis Evangelion is difficult without spoiling anything, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try to comment about late events without giving the most spoilerific information away, all the while trying to make my points as clear as possible.\n\nStory and Characters\n\nBefore anything else, there are two important external factors necessary to understand when analyzing Neon Genesis Evangelion, as they had massive influence during the production of the TV series (the movie is a beast for another time). The first is the role of director Anno Hideaki, the main creative force behind Evangelion, the second are the budget constraints that plagued the series and lead to some of the more controversial decisions that created the massive split in opinions the series is known for. Firstly, director Anno Hideaki is a person that has dealt with depression in many instances of his life and is, according to second-hand information and some interviews, someone with a very low opinion about himself. When the time slot for Evangelion was pitched to him, Anno and Gainax were in a period of failure in which the studio tried various projects that were never able to get off the ground. Rumors even tell that he was at a bar, drinking to escape his depressive state, when the idea was offered. The budget issues we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll discuss along the review, so for now let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s understand how Anno\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emotional condition at the time affected the conception of Evangelion. \n\nInitially, the series was conceptualized to be a deconstruction of the Mecha genre, bent on straying from the escapism centered narratives provided by the anime media. For those not in the know, a deconstruction is, in fiction, a work or character designed to break apart and analyze the tropes that make traditional examples of said genre or archetype. The common method of doing so is by inserting realistic outcomes the different elements of the genre would have if the setting followed the rules of the conventional world, a notable example being the graphic novel Watchmen. Works of this nature tend, but are not limited, to be very dark in tone. Having that in mind, makes sense that Evangelion would take to a very unusual level the depiction of unstable young teenagers having to pilot immensely powerful mechs to defend humanity from a mysterious threat, as well as exploring in depth the mental and emotional problems derived from that role. However, this very nature opens the work to some criticisms that works that follow the genre straight are not victim of, as the suspension of disbelief dispensed to a deconstruction is tighter. By watching Evangelion you can raise questions like:\n\n-    Why were NERV\u00e2\u0080\u0099s headquarters built under a populated city, putting in danger the lives of innocent people and exponentially raising collateral damage, especially when the Angels seem drawn to the Eva Units?\n-    Why aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the pilots offered psychological assistance, given the immense levels of pressure they suffer, as well as mental and emotional scars the fight against the Angels bring them?\n-    Why doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t NERV share at least some of its technology with the military, so that they can pose a threat to the Angels too?\n-    Why there are tits and a boner joke on my deconstruction?\n\nBefore I get ahead of myself though, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talk about the characters:\n\nIkari Shinji is the main protagonist of the series, the pilot of Eva Unit 01 and the one the internet is more used to bash for being a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpussy\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Introspective, socially awkward, extremely afraid of rejection, full of self-pity and having massive difficult to express himself, he makes clear that he only pilots the Eva because people tell him to, and in some instances seems to try forcing his acceptance onto others. Shinji is the center of the majority of discussions about Evangelion, either hailed by supporters of the series as a realistic representation of someone with depression and low self-esteem or bashed by its detractors as the rock that holds the anime from improving. Now, before you jump on me, let me tell you I actually believe Shinji is the least of the problems with the series. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d even risk saying the he is in fact a very good character, but one that is handled particularly bad by his own series. All of his issues at the beginning of Evangelion are grounded, realistic and believable, and his development doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take long to appear. The issue is how that development is handled during the anime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second half, which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll discuss in due time.\n\nKatsuragi Misato is the commanding officer in charge of orienting the pilots during the battles against the Angels, as well as the main caretaker for Shinji and Asuka. Having contrasting personalities when at work and at home, being professional and quick on thought in the former, but carefree and irresponsible in the latter, she plays major role at Shinji\u00e2\u0080\u0099s development, being the first one to try to form a connection with the boy and give him better motivations to fight, besides simply obeying orders. She is also the character with the most fully realized character-arc during Evangelion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first run and the only figure the anime doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shit on by the end. Early on, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s introduced the idea of the Hedgehog Dilemma, in which the closer people with deep-rooted emotional issues try to get, the more they risk hurting each other. This dilemma is the main topic for Misato\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship with Shinji during the first four episodes.\n\nThe next pilot is Ayanami Rei, the first children chosen to pilot the Evas, and responsible for Unit 00. Rei is the least problematic of the pilots, both in the context of the story and among the debates sprung from the anime. Considered the prototype for all kuuderes, Rei is quiet, reserved, keeps herself distant from most social interaction, seeming to only open up to Shinji\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father, and generally holds her own life in very low regard. These traits are originated from one particular information about her origins that I cannot spoil, but one can always question the level of realism of her depiction. According to Anno, her purpose in the story was to show the audience how unsettling it is to face an emotionless being, basically a character that could personify the Uncanny Valley.\n\nAsuka is the second children and the pilot of Eva Unit 02. She is brash, outspoken, eager for attention and to show herself, and packs a massive superiority complex, underneath of which lies her deep-rooted need for praise, in order to keep her self-esteem up. Asuka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s introduction in episode 08 marks a shift in mood to the series, as from the point she appears, NGE develops a campy mood, closer to traditional Monster of the Week shows. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually a very natural root to take. At this point, while old personal struggles are still present in the cast and some of them are yet to be introduced, Shinji is a lot more comfortable with his new living situation and his role as a pilot, so, while the serious stakes remain, the series is considerably lighter at this point than in the \u00e2\u0080\u009chedgehog dilemma\u00e2\u0080\u009d days. This is also the segment of the anime that features the most frequent use of sexual fanservice, or cheesecake if you prefer, which by itself is not a problem (I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not that much of a hypocrite), but will bring up an issue, in comparison to other aspect I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll comment later at this review.\n\nIkari Gendo is Shinji\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father and the main reason for the boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s issues. Having abandoned the son right after the death of his wife, Gendo displays little to no interest for him, is completely driven by his objectives as the head NERV, acts arrogant and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take much time on making decisions that might often put in danger the lives or mental stability of the pilots, quite often in ways that can only be described as plot-driven stupidity. The only person Gendo seems to be relatively worried about is Rei, as indicated in the event when he rushed to take her out of the Eva Plug, burning his hands in the process, and by the more tender expression he exhibits when talking to her.\n\nKaworu is the final pilot introduced in the series, but his appearance comes very late, making in depth descriptions difficult without spoilers. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strongly drawn to Shinji, seeming to have deep understanding of his emotional state. Not knowing the secret of his character, though, that fact gives their interaction strong homosexual undertones. Well, if you can call that \u00e2\u0080\u009cundertone\u00e2\u0080\u009d, anyway.\n\nOther characters that play important roles would be Ritsuko, head-scientist responsible to keep the Eva Units working and later the anime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s punching bag, Kaji, a man that shares a romantic past with Misato and plays a dubious role dealing with important information for NERV, and Fuyutsuki, second in command in NERV and main advisor for Gendo.\n\nThe first half of Evangelion is the part I consider worthy of genuine praise. Sure, it soon assumes campier tone than it had at the beginning, but the psychological themes are far less blatant and still stealthily addressed, as they should be. This is also the point where character development is implemented in its most effective and subtle form. For once, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take much for Shinji to stop imposing his acceptance to others and under the influence of Misato\u00e2\u0080\u0099s early support he soon starts attempting genuine interaction with the people around him. While piloting Unit 01, he also becomes much more focused, internally compelled to improve at the job and quicker to take action. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, off course, still socially awkward, a trait that becomes noticeable when confronted by Asuka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s upfront demeanor. Asuka also plays the role of a conflicting force to Shinji stern from the fact that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a teenage boy and those hormones gotta go somewhere. While the boy is drawn to her appearance, he is also turn away by her personality and his own lack of social skills. This subject, however, unfortunately ends up being forgotten as the series progresses.\n\nRei, in the other hand, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t display any interest in strengthening the relationship with other characters, but becomes slightly more receptive to interactions others initiate with her, as shown by Shinji being visibly confortable in conversations with the girl. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still very inexpressive, though. Being someone with little personal motivational to pilot the Eva, she becomes an object of contempt to Asuka, who pilots in order to gather external approval from others. Asuka becomes increasingly spiteful of Rei, as she can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t accept that someone like her gets recognition and attention from her superiors without attempting so. Even Shinji\u00e2\u0080\u0099s confortable expression while talking to Rei is a point of contempt for her. As you can see, Asuka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character arc is a downward spiral, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cconclusion\u00e2\u0080\u009d of which will see at the second half. The last bits of this segment of the story are the ones most focused on driving home the motivations of the pilots, while giving hints of deeper issues.\n\nBefore moving on, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important that I address the religious symbolism present in Evangelion. This is a target of criticism for many, as they believe it makes the show pretentious, since the symbolism doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t play a role in the story itself. You can extract from the series a commentary about how humanity uses science to challenge the Higher Power, be it God, fate or simply the inevitability of death. The symbolism, however, plays no role in that commentary and is used only for aesthetic purposes. This might surprise you, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t consider this an issue. Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s culture is barely influenced by Judeo-Christian principles, being instead influenced by Shintoism and Buddhism. Biblical references for Japanese authors are not too different from what Greek or Nord mythology is for the West.\n\nOk, Evangelion fanbase, you had your 6 episodes of fun with Asuka, but now it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to talk about the real meat of the issues with the series, its second half. The problem with addressing the issues at this part of the series is that they are not standalone problems, they merge until they create one single monstrous beast with several heads. In fairness, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t start all that menacing: episode 14 is part recap, but soon it goes back to the regular format. What this episode does is to signalize a mood-shift and foreshadow heavier emphasis on Seele, the organization that oversees NERV, and the Human Instrumentality Project. From this point on, Evangelion would feature significantly different mood, structure (again!) and severe problems with character consistency. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also here that Kaji becomes a prominent character in the story, although it calls attention to the question of what exactly is his role on the plot. All of that in mind, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start with the simpler issue, the Mind Trips.\n\nFor mind trips, I refer to the segments where characters would go to hallucinations where the majority of the issues they faced up to that point are regurgitated at them. These segments also feature some exposition about backstory, which leads me to ask: couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t this be exposed in more graceful manners? The first one, at episode 14, is fairly harmless, featuring Rei inside the Eva Plug, making vague definitions about random objects and some of the characters. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possibly a hint to the real nature of her character, but this possibility is unclear. The issue starts when we move to the other pilots, most notably Shinji. Now, up to this point, Shinji\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character development was pretty much set, what the series needed to do was to continue expanding on it and address the issues the boy had not faced yet and he would have a complete and rounded arc, going from a simple and depressed kid caught up in events much bigger than himself to a competent Unlikely Hero. The mind trips, however, work in contradiction with this development. In them, Shinji is displayed as he was in his Hedgehog Dillema days, in complete opposition to his behavior and natural demeanor outside of these sequences. In some points they try to actively disregard that development. Do you want an example? In episode sixteen, during his first mind trip, Shinji utters the following line:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI already had my happy moments and just tried to hold on to them. Is there something wrong with that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThat is a very good question, is there something wrong with that? By holding to those happy moments is how he was able to improve and become truly effective as a pilot and meaningful as a character. What is even more obnoxious is that these segments have no effect on his depiction in the real world, only serving to stagnate his development up until the end of the series. Meanwhile, Asuka continues her downward character arc. Her progress is, interestingly enough, inversely proportional to how Shinji develops alongside with her: as the boy becomes increasingly prominent as a pilot, she becomes more frustrated by the growing competition and the likelihood of facing opposition in her fight for attention and praise. Her mind trips come in to expose her past, where we can see the reasons for her low self-esteem and obsessive need for validation, essentially stuff that could be featured in a flashback, as well as allow for narrative padding. Just for clarification, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not implying that pessimistic character development is a bad thing. Part of the fun in Black Lagoon is witnessing Rock\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gradual loss of his good-will while traveling to the darkness of Roanapur and, if you want an example outside of anime, Will Munny, from The Unforgiven, is a man trying his best to be a decent person, but still has to cope with the fact he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s someone with a scary and violent nature. The issue here is that those were complete character arcs, while for Asuka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case, just like other points I talked about, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to discuss while tackling the final episodes.\n\nMoving on. Remember when I mentioned that Gendo seems to suffer from plot-driven stupidity at key events? That is not exclusive to him, as in several instances multiple characters will hold the idiot ball for the sake of progressing the narrative. This is a a common situation for when a writer wants to include an specific plot point in the story but has no proper set up to do so, resorting to make the characters act stupid so that such set up can be achieved. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s discuss some of those instances. For starters, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the ever-lingering question of why there aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t psychologists available to help the pilots. These are clearly people under severe mental and physical stress and since one suffered from depression from the beginning, one is almost completely detached from human interaction and the last one is in a downward spiral of self-hatred and need for approval, all factors that heavily influence their performance at the job, the dire need for mental assistance for those kids becomes increasingly more apparent. Some might say I shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think too much about it, but remember: this is a deconstruction, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supposed to be grounded in a realistic setting, just including out-of-this-world elements.\n\nNow going to a case-by-case take, one of the main arcs of the second half involves the fourth children selected to pilot the Evas, responsible for Unit 03. The problems arrive when Unit 03 goes rogue due to being infected by an Angel (these things seem to gain abilities based on what is convenient for the episode) and the pilots are sent to take care of it. When the responsibility comes to Shinji to fight Unit 03, he freezes because there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a person inside the Eva and he fears harming them. At no point comes to his mind to just immobilize Unit 03, neither any of his superiors gives him that idea. This leads Gendo to order the activation of the Dummy Plug, a project he knows still has problems to be fixed and whose efficiency is uncertain. In the following sequence Unit 01, under the control of the Dummy Plug, proceeds to brutalize Unit 03, far beyond the point it was necessary, without Gendo ever ordering it to cease the attack. This whole sequence is designed for shock factor, to lead the audience to feel repulse by what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening on screen, ignoring the lack of logic. It culminates when Unit 01 rips off and destroys the plug. Apparently Gendo decided they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need that pilot anymore, either that or he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an outstanding idiot.\n\nSee? It took me 6 pages of text to finally have a problem with Shinji.\n\nBesides shock factor, another purpose for this event is to lead Shinji to rebel against Gendo, reviving the tension between them. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to reprove the boy for the attitude, though, since most of what happened was due to Gendo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incompetence at commanding. When he comes back, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s displaying even better resolve to fight them before the incident, and coupled with how little of that is mentioned in the rest of the series, the whole Unit 03 arc becomes effectively pointless. After Shinji\u00e2\u0080\u0099s return, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re lead to the events of episode 20, which also has minimal relevance to the progression of the story, since soon after that comes a flashback detailing Fuyutsuki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past in relation with Gendo and the Second Impact. Hell, not even Shinij seems bothered by the absurd experiences he just went through.\n\nActually relevant stuff starts happening right after, as Asuka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s descent is leading her to get progressively worse synchronization rates with Unit 02. Since nobody does absolutely nothing to solve that, while still placing her in scenarios where maximum efficiency was needed, she ends up in a situation where her life, or at least her mental stability, is in serious danger. None of the people at NERV comes with the idea of ejecting Unit 02\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plug, a method they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve resorted several times up to this point, in order to save her. Why? I mean, besides artificially raising the tension without it being earned. Later, they continue to send her to combat, resulting in a situation where her synchronization is so low she can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even move the Eva anymore.\n\nBefore moving on to the final stretch, where I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll talk about the series final episodes, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to address the shift in mood taken by the anime on its second half. I mentioned before about how the fanservice present in the first half was not an issue at the time, but this is the point where it becomes an issue. The mood in the series becomes progressively darker and some particular scenes, specially one from episode 23 (you know which one), have potentially disturbing content, and compared to the fanservice and campy atmosphere from the first half it gives the anime an very uneven tone. The bleakness of tone stretches all around, reaching even secondary characters. Remember when I commented the character of Ritsuko becomes the punching bag of the series? Up to this point, she was a character with importance to the plot and noticeable characterization, but essentially a secondary figure, with no relevance to any of the themes and only needed to keep the plot going, and she was good that way. In the final episodes, though, she basically retreads the exact same path of misery faced by her mother, detailed in episode 21, only to be moved away from the plot for the remaining episodes and become irrelevant. Unlike works like Trigun, where the tone shift works to test the protagonist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s morals and allow him to come off as a fully rounded figure, or even Shingeki no Kyojin, where the brutal outcomes serve to emphasize the resolve the humans have to achieve their goal, this is not misery for the sake of advancing a character arc or improving the plot, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just characters being miserable for no purpose, and in the words of GoatJesus, if it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t play a purpose, why have it at all?\n\nWith Asuka falling to her deepest depressive state and the introduction of Kaworu, the series has its climax at episode 24. The two remaining episodes are the biggest source of diversion when discussing Evangelion. For once, they are giant mind trips. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supposed to take place after Gendo has initiated the Human Instrumentality Project and merged all of humanity under one collective conscience. How the project was initiated or what were the pieces for triggering it is left unexplained, the episodes simply start in the mind trip and no proper context is given until the information that Human Instrumentality began comes up. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear that it was at this point during production that the budget expenses reached their limit and Gainax was forced to compromise, bringing this as the result. For the remaining 40 minutes of the series, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a dream sequence where the emotional issues of the characters are retreaded and blatantly spelled out without ceremony or the least shred of subtlety. Asuka appears in her pre-decay persona to spout why she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so eager for attention, Shinji reminisces his issues with rejection and even Misato, who had a complete character arc at this point, reinforces her Elektra Complex when she was supposed to have come to terms with it already. At this point something finally came to my mind: Anno was able to create the basic state of his characters and the problems they would face very well, but he was not able to make them properly deal with such problems. That is why there's such a disconnect between Shinji's portrayal in the real world and in the mind trips, the characters in Evangelion are not able to fully develop their issues towards a solution, only being capable of flat out explaining them, without sublety. After many divagations, with characters bringing up philosophical concepts to replace more pertinent psychological matters, the series comes to an end with Shinji\u00e2\u0080\u0099s epiphany, in which he concludes:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut maybe I can learn to love myself. Maybe my life has a greater value. Yes, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m no one besides myself. I am me, I want to be myself. I want to continue existing in this world. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m worthy of living here!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd THAT is the problem with the ending of Neon Genessis Evangelion: it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the resolution of the numerous character arcs and plot points raised, but the acceptance of stagnation, the simple possibility of a conclusive development without truly having one. At this point, I have to ask: Why is this acceptable? Why is uncertainty preferable over closure? Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take a look at some questions that were left unresolved:\n\n-    What really are the Angels?\n-    Who was Kaji really working for and what were his objectives?\n-    What was Seele\u00e2\u0080\u0099s objective with the Human Instrumentality Project?\n-    If Both Seele and Gendo want the Human Instrumentality Project, why there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so much animosity between them?\n-    What is the origin of the Dead Sea Manuscripts, or even their nature itself?\n-    What was the fate of Asuka and Ritsuko?\n-    How did Seele \u00e2\u0080\u009cfind\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kaworu?\n\nAnd before you tell me that the series is not about these mysteries, but about the issues characters face, let me stop you, because Evangelion built a sizeable chunk of its appeal on these questions. For the last 11 episodes, give or take depending on your perspective, the audience has watched ever-increasing pain plaguing the main cast, but unlike something like Berserk, for example, where the horror of what is happening to the characters is compensated by the full realization of multiple character arcs, as well as the conclusion to an event that has been foreshadowed through the entire series, here the audience is rewarded with vagueness and uncertainty.\n\nPresentation\n\nWell, here is the boring part of the review.\n\nOk, everyone knows by now of the effects the budget limitations had on Evangelion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presentation, but before we get into that, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talk a little about what are really strong moments for the visuals display in the series. For once, cinematography is excellent. Multiple scenes feature various meaningful details, giving away subtle information that could not be included in the dialogue, and when there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little time for details, and framing is effectively used to convey the emotions of the scene. There was a clear understanding among Gainax that animation is also a tool for storytelling and not just a fun way of putting images on a screen. A sequence like Shinji entering Misato\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apartment for the first time could be just a bland moment unimportant for the story, but is used to emphasize the importance of the decision the two are about to make and, in the same vein, lighting also plays a big role in moments of dialogue, helping establish the mood for the scene. Colorization is usually realistically applied, not counting the traditional oddly-colored hair-styles, with mostly pale colors applied throughout the enviroment, but good care is put into making what is important pop in the screen, from relevant characters to information about the action and, obviously, the action itself.\n\nAside from the traditional methods used by studios to cut corners in animation, the symptoms of the decreasing budget appear distinctively in two areas, one being the long stretches of static imagery, where time was really moving and, no, your computer did not freeze while you were watching it (for real, I once thought that was the case). Oddly enough, there are people who argue that those moments of absolutely nothing happening are what add to the artistic intent of the story. To them I say \u00e2\u0080\u009cstop inserting meaning where there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any\u00e2\u0080\u009d, there is nothing there that really needed a minute and a half to achieve what could be done in ten seconds. The other practice that made the money issue noticeable was the reuse of footage and in no place is that more apparent than in, again, the mind trip sequences. During such sequences the amount of reused frames was too much to count and details on screen were kept to a minimum. Unsurprisingly, those were also the instances where the cinematography also took a nose-dive in quality.\n\nNow to the sound: I watched the series subbed, because off course, that how I do it. The performances in Japanese are nothing to complain about. Shinji\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice work is nowhere near as annoying as his western counterpart, playing a much more subdued tone when away from the intense sequences, Asuka is, in the other hand, just the right degree of annoying she should be, but smoothly transitioning to lower tones when the character reaches her lower points, and Rei is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 well, Rei. Fun fact: the voice actress for Rei was Hayashibara Megumi, the same one who played Faye Valentine in Cowboy Bebop. The opening is the iconic Zankoku na Tenshi no Teeze, or Thesis of a Cruel Angel, an extremely catchy song, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d also advise you to look for the lyrics, which is very compelling and fitting for Shinji\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character. The ending is a rendition of Fly me to the Moon, which is not really my kind of music, but if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s yours, good enough.\n\nPersonal Ramblings\n\nAs harsh as I might have sounded in this review, I want to make it clear that I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do this to diminish and lash out against fans of the series or to provide ego-boosting to detractors, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not ThatAnimeSnob. I wrote it with the purpose of showing my perspective, the perspective of someone who went into the series open minded and willing to take the most out of it, but came out disheartened by clumsy writing wasting away solid potential. I bet 19-year-old me really wanted to like Neon Genesis Evangelion. Besides what my favorites list might indicate, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m all for appreciating what is old and influent in a media and that was one of my biggest drives while going into the series for the first time.\n\nUnfortunately, by the end of it I could just repeat to myself: If only! If only the tone was kept consistent throughout the whole series; if only the unnecessary plot points were discarded in favor of tightening the script; if only the mysteries had been fully explored; if only the character dilemmas had been properly addressed and character arcs were completed; if only money was used to animate actually relevant plot-threads, giving the series the proper resolution it needed. Ironically, many of these problems are what makes Evangelion, to this day, such a divisive series and highly talked about subject, spawning countless interpretations and counterpoints. Perhaps if the series didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have all of the problems I discussed about and was a self-contained, complete story, it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be nowhere near as influent and heated topic. Yes, its flaws are what make it memorable.\n\nEvangelion is inevitable by this point. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s considered obligatory watch for any anime fan and the result is almost always a passionate inclination to either love it or hate it. Believe it or not, I used to dislike the series even more than I do now. There was a time where I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t comprehend what people saw in the anime and my reaction to anyone who placed it among their favorites was \u00e2\u0080\u009cReally?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nowadays I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve grown to better understand their reasoning, even though I still stand by everything I said here. I even got to be far more forgiving to Shinji than most detractors of the series are. If you like Evangelion, if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your favorite anime and something you wholeheartedly cherish, here is what I have to say: it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s OK, that won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lead me to have anything against you, I might even like you, but, by the end of the day, my opinion is still the one I trust in the first place.\n\nOh, one last thing: stop calling Asuka a Tsundere, she has no dere-side and only going halfway isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough to fit the archetype!"}, {"id": 2158, "score": 50, "body": "NOTE:  This is a reposting of a review I did over at myanimelist.  If this seems a bit familiar, that's why.  Additionally, I realized that my review isn't exactly friendly to newcomers to the series, so I've attempted to amend that.\n\nI consider myself a pretty big fan of Katekyo Hitman Reborn.  I love the manga; even though it took a sharp dive in quality partway through, I can still say it's worth reading.  Another JUMP classic, Fist of the North Star, had the same issue and I think it's one of the greatest manga ever.  So why am I giving the anime of Reborn such a low score?  Simply put, it's a bad adaptation.  While I haven't watched the entire series, I'm sure most folks will agree with me that 104 episodes of a show is more than enough for one to form an accurate judgement.\n\nFirst off, I felt like the plot of Reborn was, for the most part, poorly adapted.  The manga starts as a simple, goofy comedy series (a portion known as the Daily Life arc) that takes a hard turn towards action eight books in with the Kokuyo and Varia arcs.  Anyhow, while I feel like the decision to move some of the Daily Life arc's more inconsequential portions around to act as fillers later on in between the Kokuyo and Varia arcs (as well as during the Varia arc) was an excellent idea, some of the adaptations of the plots in those chapters was, well, poor.  Some jokes were stretched out and turned into something asinine (like the whole Stickypaper Theory thing), or removed entirely because the folks handling the adaptation felt they would be too risque for the audience they were targeting. One of my favorite chapters from the DL arc was one where Kyoko and Tsuna play Russian Roulette.  Due to its content, it was left out entirely.  (Truly unfortunate, since part of the DL arc's strengths lie in its occasionally morbid humor sensibilities.)  That being said, several of these earlier episodes are still quite fun to watch.  While some of the more humorous moments aren't present, these episodes have a \"cozy\" feeling to them.\n\nWhen the anime got to the serious bits, it watered them down heavily to stretch them out.  I know this is a standard practice for long-running mega-hit shounen manga adaptations, but there's no way those latter bits of the Varia arc should feel so slow, especially when the adaptation of the Kokuyo arc is, for the most part, fantastic.  The pacing is magnificent; I never felt like it was dragging it's feet like the later arcs do.  \n\nAdditionally, the staff eventually begins engaging in one of the most awful shounen manga adaptation tropes: the beginning-of-episode recap.  I understand that these shows live and die on being able to maintain a fanbase, and part of that comes from being able to pull in new viewers.  That makes these recaps in longer-running shows something of a necessary evil.  However, these recaps can easily be much more concise; the only reason for their length is to help pad out each episode to help ensure the series doesn't catch up too far to the manga.\n\nThe worst practice used, however,  is putting the tail-end of the episode AFTER the ED in some episodes, which I think is just plain dickish.  The only reason for that is to ensure viewers watch the ED (which is advertising some song that the studio and producers earn money for advertising) and the commercials.  While adaptations like this are, essentially, commercials themselves for merchandise related to the series brand (such as the manga), part of that merchandise are the DVD sales of the series itself, and that's doubly true for fujoshi-focused series like this.  As such, placing the conclusion of the episode after the ED only serves to frustrate its core audience, as they may skip that last little sliver by accident.\n\nThe only thing I felt the anime improved upon is placing the chapter where a particularly plot-important character first appears much later than it occurs in the manga.  I actually had no idea he had appeared about 124 chapters earlier when Amano reintroduced him.\n\nMoving on to toning down the darker bits, that move was fairly irritating.  The fights lacked a lot of the intensity they had in the manga due to the decision to stop having characters bleed after the Kokuyo arc.  In addition, Artland's decision to make all the weapons look unrealistic was fairly stupid, but I can tolerate it for the most part. I can buy having Leone turning into a pistol or a rifle for Reborn to shoot, but the whole \"Dying Will energy leaving the bullets and flying into Tsuna\" thing was idiotic.  Why didn't they just remove bullets leaving the guns and replace it with the energy beams?  And while I can tolerate replacing missing teeth with pocketwatches (it makes sense in context; I'd rather not spoil anything), it removes a lot of tension from those scenes.\n\nMost importantly, they removed Yamamoto's introduction.  While I won't spoil anything, it's probably the most moving character introduction in the DL arc, and Artland cut it out entirely because they felt it was too dark.  Now, Yamamoto just looks like a moron that suddenly begins tagging along with Tsuna and Gokudera because he's intrigued by what he believes to be their mafia role-play game.\n\nMoving on to other character alterations, Tsuna's quite a bit less of a jerk early on than he was in the anime, and is mother is much less mean to Tsuna.  Considering Tsuna's behavior ealry on, her attitude makes since, and it later softens as Tsuna (despite what Akira Amano may say in the manga's God-forsaken non-ending) grows as a person.  In the anime, this is removed entirely, as well.\n\nThe art actually looks pretty damn good; and, in the DL arc, it's a great improvement.   The animation, however, is not.  It's very jerky and still.  Amano's artwork in the manga is far, far more animated than the anime itself is thanks to some of her wonderful panel layouts.  Many of the actions scenes look absolutely sluggish in comparison to the manga.  Artland could've attempted to fake movement by making the artwork more dynamic (which is arguably the backbone of Japanese animation) but they couldn't even be bothered to do that.  Instead, every fight looks terribly bland and overly clean, with the characters being drawn exactly on-model, virtually without injury, and rarely moving.\n\nI'm a bit baffled on what to say for the soundtrack for the show.  I should note that I'm not referring to the OPs or EDs, as I generally skip those; while okay, they weren't worth hearing repeatedly in a marathon of the show.  There were about two fantastic tracks in the shows catalog: Standing Friends and Tsuna Awakens.  However, the anime greatly overuses them to the point where they lose almost all meaning.  The other tracks are fairly mediocre, and, as such, don't deserve much criticism at all, positive or negative.\n\nIn the end, I can't recommend this anime.  I hate that I wasted so much of my time waiting for the anime to start adapting the manga right, and it never did. To this day, there are fans in Japan (http://otakuusamagazine.com/LatestNews/News1/Japanese-Fans-Want-These-Anime-to-Get-Sequels-8399.aspx) hoping to eventually see the remaining two arcs (one a step-down in quality from the one before; the other a nose-dive) adapted.  I can only assume the reason for wanting more of Artland's adaptation is simply so that its obsessive fanbase can hear the characters speak even more, which, honestly speaking, is probably why any of them followed the anime in the first place.  It does have fairly solid voice casting, and that is probably the cornerstone of the anime's success.  Several image albums featuring the cast members singing several songs related to the series (tangentially or otherwise) in the voices of the characters were released, with one of them even becoming an ending song on the show.  Most notably, there were about five different \"Rebocons\"; concerts where the voice cast would act out skits on-stage like the characters from the show that they portray and sing songs.  I can't say I've heard of other VA-centric series like DiaLovers, for example, courting followings like that.\n\nAnyway, read the manga instead.  It's far superior in nearly every way.  The only conceivable way the anime is better is if one is a massive seiyuu fanatic."}, {"id": 2168, "score": 60, "body": "~~~__Hope Amidst Stagnation and the Incessantness of Time__~~~\n~~~img320(https://68.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_md399s3xNO1qjtzsdo1_500.png)~~~\n\nWe often read manga as a means to satisfy our unbounded fantasies; a means of temporary escapism from the real world.

That second theme is that no matter how different people are, everyone has a story to tell, and the chapter does this by showing three different sets of people; adults, adolescents, and kids. The second chapter, _Before Dawn_ continues to establish the same two themes but does things more interestingly by including the aspect of time, establishing the important role it plays in both the manga and in people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lives.\n\nFrom chapter three onwards is where the real meat is - it is where the real set of short stories begin. Melancholic in its tone, each story is a reflection on life, exploring the pressing concerns of each main character or the indifference that some of them feel, as they come to a realization or try to find a sense of purpose in their lives. Chapter four does this brilliantly because, in it, we get to see the contrast in the struggles between the father who is an adult, a young adult, and the student who is an adolescent. Through this, we not only get to see that age is something that segregates society, but also the fact that regardless of age, everyone has their own struggles.\n\n~~~img620(http://i.imgur.com/ee5Y2NV.png)~~~\n\nThe noteworthy chapters that follow afterwards are the ones that deal with the stagnation of life, accompanied by the idea of what we expect life to be like vs. what it actually turns out to be like. The first of the bunch is chapter five, wherein we get a shop clerk who dreams of a happier and romantic life, then falls in love at first sight, only to later be disappointed by her expectations. Next, there is chapter six, _How to Spend a Day Off_. In it, we get a character who does not really have a sense of purpose in life, choosing to go with the flow of life instead of having and pursuing dreams because she believes that they would just do her more harm than good. The chapter invokes a sense of regret - that although not said, but implied, the character should have spent her life doing better things instead of just going with the flow of life. It is a nice chapter reminding us to not always conform to and accept mundanity - that if we really want to do something, or are passionate about something, then we should pursue it instead of idling away with time. The following chapter, What a Wonderful World, is more nostalgic in nature. It has the main character reading a letter she wrote to herself five years ago, reflecting on the belief that she has become \u00e2\u0080\u009ca boring adult\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that the world she had imagined \u00e2\u0080\u009cis nothing, but a vague mirage\u00e2\u0080\u009d. The last highlight of the short stories is chapter nine, Tokyo. It shows a mangaka who is getting nowhere in his career. It is similar to chapter six in the sense that it also invokes a sense of regret and is accompanied by the theme of loneliness. \n\n~~~img320(http://i.imgur.com/MgssltH.png)~~~\n\nThere are no jolly or happy conclusions to the stories that are presented, but neither do they end on a depressing note. They all have realistic conclusions that end on a hopeful note. Most of the characters long for something grander than what they had either imagined or are currently facing. They long for a reality that only exists in their dreams; a kind of life that is better than the mundanity and stagnation of their current one. At the end of these stories, the characters continue on with their lives just like real humans. They have to come to terms with themselves and face their realities, but their hope for a better life in the bleakness of their stagnant lives and incessantness of time lingers. If Dawn is a representation of their hope, then the journeys that we are presented with in this manga are a representation of Before Dawn.\n\n~~~img620(https://68.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ludl9iRLXo1qc9i7vo1_1280.png)~~~\n\n<hr style=\"height:3px; border:none; color:rgb(60,90,180); background-color:rgb(60,90,180);\">\n\n__Should you read it?__\nYes.

Although not everyone will be able to directly relate to all of the stories, there is something in it for everyone because each story takes a realistic approach to the characters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 problems. Through this manga, Inio Asano challenges us to reflect on our lives and face our own realities, no matter how harsh or mundane."}, {"id": 2199, "score": 67, "body": "Children losing their parents in tragedy has long become a staple of animated movies since Disney's melancholy 1942 tearjerker, _Bambi_, but it's rather rare to find an animated feature where a similar incident occurs, and the story doesn't end \"happily ever after.\"  Imagine, if you will, that Bambi and Littlefoot (the hero brontosaurus from Don Bluth's _The Land Before Time_) never got over their mother's deaths, especially with no one to comfort them, but instead they defect from their own kind to join forces with the killer and become corrupt monsters themselves.  Do so, and you get the basic idea behind _Ringing Bell_, a rather obscure 1978 Japanese animated feature which, despite its initially cuddly setup, is as downbeat and mean-spirited as you'll probably never see from cartoons today.\n\nThe film, which barely clocks in at 45 minutes (making it more of a featurette than anything else), tells the story of Chirin, an adorable little lamb who, like most innocent little protagonists in a children's animated tale, grows up on a farm with his mother.   One night, however, a ferocious wolf attacks the sheep on the barn, and in protecting her child, the lamb's mother is bumped off.  Of course Chirin is a storm of tears, but none of the other sheep show him any sympathy.  In despair, Chirin runs away to take vengeance on his mother's killer, at least initially, then later decides to join forces with the wolf.  In doing so, Chirin grows into a ram, every bit as cold and ruthless as his \"foster father.\"  But when the two return to attack the same barn one night, Chirin finds himself having a serious identity crisis.  Needless to say, there's no happy ending in store for this \"little lost lamb.\"\n\nIt's beyond shocking to discover that _Ringing Bell_ was produced by Sanrio, the folks behind the much more lighthearted \"_Hello Kitty_\".  How a studio who created a sugarcoated franchise could churn out a movie as dark and depressing as this is hard to believe!  To its credit, though, _Ringing Bell_ does not look like your usual Japanese animated fare, but instead possesses a style that is almost but not quite Disneyesque, somewhere between that and Hanna-Barbera's adaptation of the popular children's book_ Charlotte's Web_. Furthermore, the animation itself is quite fluid, running at a full 24-frames per second.\n\nAesthetically, though, _Ringing Bell_ isn't just a gloomy tale, it looks like one, too.  A good majority of the scenes are very smoky and shadowy.  The final confrontation between Chirin and his nemesis/foster father in particular is painted with dark, dreary colors.  Adding to the somewhat disconcerting presentation of the movie are the character designs.  Young Chirin and the other sheep are very much reminiscent of the typical sheep-like characters you would see from a classic Disney cartoon, while having a somewhat stylized look similar to that of \"_Hello Kitty_\", while the wolf and later on, the adult Chirin are designed to look intimidatingly threatening and scary.\n\nSurprisingly, too,  _Ringing Bell_  is a musical, but the characters never break into song. Rather, the occasional musical numbers are performed by an offscreen male chorus, setting an appropriately melancholy tone to the production. These are mostly done during transitional scenes, such as a tender moment when Chirin is walking through the meadow with his mother, and later on, as we watch the little lamb grow into a ram. The one drawback is that the songs aren't particularly memorable, but they are at least fittingly moody.\n\nThere's a bit of a dated, old-school feel to the animation and the songs, but considering the glut of computer animation today, watching a movie as vintage as this is refreshing, at least from my standpoint.\n\nThere's even a dubbed voice track for the audience who would have little patience for listening to the Japanese version with subtitles.  Like the movie, the dub, too, is an old school production dating from the 1980's, a period when dubs were, at most, not very good.  Barbara Goodson voices the young Chirin, and unfortunately, her performance sticks out in all the wrong ways.  There are moments that come across as well delivered, but more often than not, her performance is too strained and unconvincing, and I found her voice rather grating.  (In all fairness, the Japanese VA for this character isn't much easier on the ears.)  Gregg Burger fares a bit better as the older Chirin, although his performance is limited to the last fifteen minutes.  Ironically, his performance, as well as that of Ron Gans as the narrator, are the best of an otherwise serviceable but mostly average dub.\n\nFluidly animated though  _Ringing Bell_  is, it's difficult to know who this story is targeted at:  children?  Adults?  Good question.  For animation buffs looking for a change of pace from the usual fare today's animation market churns out, though, this movie could very well be worth a look."}, {"id": 2203, "score": 60, "body": "If you want to know what the deal with Corpse Party is and were hoping to watch this instead of play the game, you'll be disappointed. And confused. Mostly disappointed.\n\nStory: There's a good one in here somewhere. But they tried to crunch way too much plot into way too little time, and an otherwise gruesome, horrific mystery turned into a rushed, hackneyed, nonsensical excuse for blood and gore. Every time a new plot point blew by I thought 'this would be interesting if there had been any build up or care given to the story whatsoev-- whups, there goes another head.' If they had turned this into a full series and given the story half a chance to breathe, this could have been a gut-churning downward spiral into some of the darkest subject matter I've ever seen. Instead, they took something with decent potential and turned it into pure torture porn. You get desensitized _really _ quickly, until even the unthinkable (like children being brutally murdered) becomes so much viscera covered in so much red paint and blah blah whatever.\n\nCharacters: Cannon fodder. You get their names, told they're friends, and then they drop so fast you can barely keep anything straight. The final shot at the end would have unnerved me for days if they had let us feel anything. For anyone. At all. Any attempt to garner some empathy passes by so fast you can barely recognize it before the character is killed off.\n\nAnimation: I thought it was passable for something that came out around 2005. Then I saw it was released in 2013. Ouch.\n\nVoice Acting: Not worth commenting on simply because the actors were given nothing to do but cry and scream.\n\nMusic: Served it's purpose.\n \n\nDon't get me wrong, torture porn may be your cup of tea, which is fine.

Watch 'Another' instead."}, {"id": 2206, "score": 59, "body": "Self-awareness might be the best friend of otherwise average to bad shows. The most recent example of how this works well might be Boku no Hero Academia. It doesn't promise you anything it can't deliver. And you get exactly what you were looking for, nothing more, nothing less. Sounds like a fair deal, right? With that in mind, Dragon Maid tries to do the same - this time among the vast ocean of slice of life mediocrities.\n\nMany comment on the cute girls, casual humor, light fanservice and KyoAni's visuals. But what this show actually revolves around is often missed. Kobayashi is an office lady who used to live alone until Tohru and Kanna formed a family-like setup in her life. And that's it. How much becoming responsible for a family can change an adult? What Kobayashi's experience answers to us is that it won't change people at all. Sure, we do learn new things from raising a child, we do need to concede and make some sacrifices. That's why Kobayashi is the same person from episode one to the last. She's always the same laid-back, hard-working gal who loves a happy hour once in a while, with those dead-fish eyes to die for. And that's good enough.\n\nUnfortunately, the other aspects\u00e2\u0080\u008b of this show are almost negligible. Side characters have any but surface-level purposes such as comic relief or fanservice. Also the setting doesn't make any difference. We could not have any dragons and it woudn't touch the purpose of the story. Having only Kanna, Kobayashi and Tohru introduced would not change the theme of the anime. What is redeeming though, is the self-awareness of this show. Whenever it takes a turn on fanservice, comedy or a heart warming moment, Dragon Maid knows what it is doing. And will be honest about it whenever possible. The best example of this is might be the \"beach episode\". It sure has a dose of fanservice, but soon we get to know a little more about Kobayashi and Tohru. The result is a heartening experience, instead of what a plain showcase of the girls' bodies would provide.\n\nThis is far from being a sign of recovery by KyoAni, but it's already a step ahead. As expected from them, audiovisuals are of top-tier quality. Distinctive character designs, fluid animation, gorgeous backgrounds. All in a tradicional cartoonish style, uncommon to see in anime nowadays. OST might sound repetitive many times, but this doesn't bother at all. Also unskippable opening/ending songs make it up for the experience. Voice acting is on point too, with a special spotlight on Kanna and Kobayashi's voices - They stand out above the rest in their characterizations. \n\nSometimes making it simple is the best. Sometimes we need a more human, light hearted story to sit and relax after a long day. It's time for the industry to try to be more honest, sensitive, and human on anime. Let's hope that KyoAni gets the message. Let's make this the starting point.

I am not trying to compare the two. Rather, I want to highlight the recent anime presence in mainstream Western media, namely the cinema industry. Does this signal an ongoing de-stigmatisation of anime in the West beyond [Ghibli ](https://anilist.co/studio/21/StudioGhibli)films? One can hope.\n\n~~~img250(http://i.imgur.com/OU4o0Su.jpg)~~~\n\nI query this because *Koe no Katachi*, coming out of [Koyto Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/2/KyotoAnimation) and directed by [Naoko Yamada](https://anilist.co/staff/102498/NaokoYamada) of [*K-On*](https://anilist.co/anime/5680/KOn) and [*Tamako*](https://anilist.co/anime/20519/TamakoLoveStory) fame, is seemingly very conventional as far as drama anime and especially KyoAni productions go. It checks most of the boxes: high school drama, complete with the usual MC-window-seat-second-from-the-back, picturesque suburban bridges, summertime fireworks, and of course, a climactic school festival. \n\nAt the same time, however, it deals with subject matter significantly heavier than your typical KyoAni fluff. Bullying, disability, and the pervasive problem of suicide take centre stage. And although it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s refreshing to see KyoAni try and push a little further, how well do they adapt?\n\n~~~img470(http://i.imgur.com/MMovGxF.png)~~~\n\n# Fear and self-loathing in Japan\n***\nIn sixth grade, Shouya \u00e2\u0080\u0093 popular and daring \u00e2\u0080\u0093 bullies the new girl, Shoko, who happens to be deaf. He is later bullied by his friends, including co-conspirators, because of this maltreatment. Later, in high school, a lonely and guilt-ridden Shouya attempts to reconnect with Shoko to make amends for his mistakes.\n\nKids can be cunts. \n\n~~~img470(http://i.imgur.com/ii1DipA.png)~~~\n\nNo, that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t my main take away from this film. Rather, I point to the fact of how good of a job *Koe no Katachi* does in making me utterly despise Shouya when he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little kid. Ultimately, this is a character-centric story; that is, a story that revolves around Shouya. So, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commendable how fleshed-out and nuanced of a character Shouya is. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a cunt to begin with. He is punished by those around him. Guilt cripples him. He tries his best to redeem himself. Not because of superficial or selfish reasons, mind you, but out of a palpable sense of regret. That said, he still must overcome his own, nagging flaws, and those of his friends around him. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to understand and empathise with his thoughts and actions, even if you disapprove of them, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because of this that Shouya is a strong and successful protagonist. One who we actively root for and are glad to see triumph, even if his victories are only small.\n\nSubsequently, the film is both heart-warming and poignant. Similarly, the themes of bullying, isolation, guilt, and suicide, whilst not exactly subtly handled, are done deftly enough such that the film\u00e2\u0080\u0099s messages remain pertinent. It was particularly moving to see how Shoko and Shouya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mothers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most affected by the films on-goings \u00e2\u0080\u0093 responded to and took up the emotional burdens experienced by their children.\n  \n~~~img470(http://i.imgur.com/c1Nhmeq.png)~~~\n\nThe film\u00e2\u0080\u0099s greatest pitfall is the characters outside of Shouya. The issue here is that there is an ensemble cast, when the story should really be focused on the central duo. There are too many characters, a couple of which are randomly introduced halfway through the film. Because of this, most of the cast is peripheral and one-dimensional. Their characterisations can be summed up in single sentences, and literally are. It's difficult to care for anyone beyond Shouya and, as previously mentioned, the central pair's immediate family to an extent. Attention and valuable screen time is thus wasted on these secondary characters that, by virtue of their sheer number, inherently remain underdeveloped anyway. It is not clear if there are satisfying conclusions for most of them, Even the central Shoko remains relatively enigmatic, which I guess is a good thing because of her hearing disability and the themes of communication and isolation that arise from it, however.\n\nSimilarly, the story itself is long and meandering. The film has a 129-minute runtime, which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d argue is unwarranted. It certainly feels long. There are too many plot points; there needs to because there are too many characters. The opening flashback sequence overstays its welcome. The emotional peaks lose their punch simply because so many are piled on top of one another. \n\n~~~img470(http://i.imgur.com/t9IsBlh.png) ~~~\n\nI feel as if these problems are easily avoidable, even if that means straying slightly from the source material.\n\nAlso, Japanese hospitals are really understaffed, this film would have me believe.\n\n# Scuffed shoes and 'X' marks the spot\n***\nInterestingly, visually *Koe no Katachi* departs from KyoAni\u00e2\u0080\u0099s usual hyper-polished look. Here, the art is warm and a lot homelier, whilst the colours are light, which reinforces the story\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personality and how intimate it aims to feel. As expected from a feature-length KyoAni production, it's generally gorgeous, complete with an exorbitant number of light effects. Character designs are decent, for the most part.\n\n~~~img470(http://i.imgur.com/joGQXUv.png)~~~\n\nThere are a lot of visual motifs. Some, like the characters, are harder hitting than others. Some, like some of the characters, are introduced and then abandoned. Some, like the characters, are too ham-fisted to be effective. In this sense, the visual cues are really hit or miss. I especially adored the more understated things, like Shouya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loose shirt tag and the emphasis on shoes and shins, which reinforces the idea of isolation and a downward gaze. Contrastingly, the big fat \u00e2\u0080\u0098X\u00e2\u0080\u0099s over people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s faces come off as gimmicky and crude in comparison. \n\n~~~img420(http://i.imgur.com/mJ5mb1i.png) img420(http://i.imgur.com/H2JP5ie.png)~~~\n\nThe sound design is strong. I especially liked the ambient noises that reflected Shoko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inner-world. Voice-acting is on point. The soundtrack, whilst not exactly memorable, fits in nicely.\n\n#Reverberating into the future?\n***\nOn one hand, *Koe no Katachi* bites off more than it can chew. It is plagued by easily fixable issues, like an overly-extensive cast and runtime, which ultimately dampens the harder-hitting stuff. On the other hand, it is a visually stunning and emotional story that follows the progression of an empathetic, well-developed character. \n\nIf this is a sign for more anime films in international cinemas, then I hope this is, as well as *your name*, can act as building blocks.\n\n\n~~~<h2>Would I recommend *Koe no Katachi*? __Yes.__</h2>~~~\n\n__**Addendum:__ If anyone's Deaf or hard of hearing, or otherwise involved in these communities, it'd be greatly appreciated if you'd like to message me your thoughts regarding this film.

Another season of [Millepensee's](http://anilist.co/studio/6073/Millepensee) Berserk. I really don't think anybody asked for a season two this time around.

But since they announced the second season with the end of the first season, it must mean they had been planning on doing 24 episodes from the start no matter what. After all, as far as my knowledge goes, Berserk 2016 sold like absolute dogshit. But no matter how negative I may be towards MillepenshouldsticktoTeekyuu's Berserk, I can't really say I wish that it didn't exist at all because maybe if it didn't, we wouldn't have gotten Berserk Musou.

Also the Dragonslayer _fucking bent_ as he swung it, but for at least one shot of the teaser, they had CG Guts actually have a 2D face. But of course they realized the main character having a 2D face throughout all of the action scenes (and most of the dialogue scenes) would be way more expensive so they jettisoned that.\n\nyoutube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXWDTb73AeE)\n\nPoint is, it's very slight, but in Berserk 2017, Guts and Casca's CG faces actually look... somewhat better? It's sort of telling that this is actually a positive that I'm bothering to mention. \"Oh yeah, the characters look more like the characters they're supposed to be.\" Also CG Griffith is actually pretty alright, so there's that too.\n\nThe OP is... well first off, I liked Inferno of the first season, but honestly I actually really prefer Sacrifice. 9MM Parabellum Bullet calmed themselves down a little bit because for season two, the opening of the show is an actual opening rather than just the Eclipse shrinked down to a minute. Also, why is the [opening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kx-1TghelNQ) now entirely 2D, and why is the 2D better than the first season's opening? \n\nMillemisery, do you just love laughing at an entire fanbase? The first season's opening at least had a few seconds of CG Guts clumsily swinging the Dragonslayer around at nothing in an empty field. Because you know, that's _the actual show_. But okay, people seem to like the 2D parts the best, let's make the entire season 2 opening 2D while keeping the rest of the show almost entirely CG. \n\nThat'll definitely fix the problem.\n\nOh yeah, we're not in Conviction land anymore, so at the very least we don't have to tolerate any more of Nina. I didn't even mention her in the first review because they actually captured her character perfectly. The walking worst part of the Conviction arc, manga or otherwise, is gone. Hell yes I'm actually seriously listing this as a positive.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/AXSbFJP.jpg)\n\nMost of Schierke's magic stuff and stuff with the Astral Realm was pretty good. Matter of fact, that was probably my overall favorite part of Berserk 2017, to be honest.\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/ouHYIbl.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/T5WC7LS.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/NOZPY4d.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/NBEYVmn.png)~~~\n\nUm... there wasn't any outright copy and pasted mobs this time... they still do the CG and 2D on the screen at the same time but it's certainly lessened comparing to last season.\n\nThat's about all I can think of right now. Now, let's not have any more false starts and __just get into it finally__.\n\n___\n\n#The More Things Clang... the More They Stay Hai Yo.#\n\nEpisode ~~one~~ thirteen, here we GO.\n\nyoutube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMqpdxdKH0g)\n\n\"Why is the camera shaking? Good lord, could you just keep it stable for two seconds? The shaking does not add to the actio--OH GOD RAPID FIRE CLANGS. THEY LEARNED NOTHING.\"\n\nGuts still clangs, Zodd clangs, Grunbeld clangs. Really, the clangs must just be an indicator if it's a strong character or not. Literally no other characters clang. And yes, it's the exact same clang from season one. They still didn't have enough money for a [new sound effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IClfBHSxec). But you know, I have to state I do respect Millefoolery for sticking to their guns and keeping the clang. The [memes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_IngYY4iWI) this show has spawned aside, like Hai Yo, the clang is a staple of this adaptation. A small part of me would have been sad if it was gone.\n\nWait. What?\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/s0XH1lM.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/QFDe2Kd.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/MCyuoQk.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/SZdmyjk.png)~~~\n\n...Guts used his sword as an actual sword against the ogre in episode nineteen. It clearly cuts through the ogre, and it does not clang. But spirits, possessed little girls, soldiers... everything else it clangs against? And I mean the clang is present throughout the episodes after this one so... why? Seriously, why only this scene?\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/IyxMtpv.png)\n\n_Actually, I was wrong. It happens against the trolls in both the episode before and after this one. Still, why only against the trolls and ogres?_\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/Yg8spVp.png)\n\n\"Oh my god they did Raksas PERFECTLY. And in full 2D! Wait no, the only reason why they would do that is if this is his only appearance in what they're covering of the arc.\"\n\nI was correct. Berserk 2017 is only covers a part of the Millennium Falcon arc. Unfortunate, but was to be expected. There was no way we were ever gonna get to the boat. Or the ~!World Transformation.!~\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/CIsPelR.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/Ujj2k13.png)~~~\n\nWas kind of really surprised that we even got to see the Abyss. You know, since both times it actually appears other than this time, have always been skipped over by various Berserk adaptations. It's what he says in the manga too, but I could only stifle a laugh when Guts says \"he's seen it before\" in Berserk 2017. Yeah, we could have seen the introduction of it if they hadn't decided to just skip everything else to just get to Conviction with Berserk 2016.\n\nIt's fine, really. The entire main theme of the first review was me ranting about them leaving things out from the manga. I shouldn't be annoyed that they actually _included_ something, even if they left out the actual introduction or explanation of the thing they included.\n\n___\n\n# [Seriously, Stop With Hai Yo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIE7vl8ayXE) #\n_For the full experience, only click on the above link while wearing headphones and having volume up to full blast._\n\nI had thought they were going a little bit crazy with this in the first season. Almost every single time Guts appears or steps out with the Dragonslayer, Hai Yo starts to play. I know it's Susumu Hirasawa and he's a __[walking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-et_5qY46rQ) [musical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwZTl5-7VYk) [god](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjPJm55cTm0)__, but there is such a thing as overuse. I honestly think that GEMBA and co. honestly couldn't afford a full Susumu Hirasawa OST like [some other Berserk adaptations](https://anilist.co/anime/33/KenpuuDenkiBerserk) or maybe Susumu Hirasawa was like...\n\n\"No, you can have TWO songs. Only two. Because I don't want people to associate my music with... well, with this.\"\n\nimg440(https://i.redd.it/zlganyqrf70z.gif)\n\nAnd quite honestly, I can't blame the man if that was actually true. He probably felt obligated because apart from Satoshi Kon's stuff (which are all winners by the way, [especially this](https://anilist.co/anime/1943/Paprika)) and [this](https://anilist.co/anime/1178/DetonatorOrgun), the only series he's ever done music for is Berserk.\n\nLike if they had just tried a bit harder with the OST, they wouldn't have had to rely on Hirasawa's Hai Yo and Ash Crow. With season two, I guess they felt that they needed to experiment because on two separate occasions, both early as well as later in the season, they suddenly just bust out some jazz.\n\n...Jazz? In Berserk? You... you did watch the previous Berserk adaptations right? You did... you did listen to[ the music Susumu Hirasawa did for Berserk before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ew3--XVFioU), right? Why in the fuck would you ever think jazz would be a good idea to _trips over a stack of conveniently placed frying pans_\n\nBut no really, jazz aside, almost the entire OST is totally forgettable and that's just... honestly one of my least favorite parts of the entire series. Maybe I'm just biased because of how much I love the 97 series/Susumu Hirasawa. But no really... there's Hai Yo, [Ash Crow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mva6nc7YBpk), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTfjg2LYquY), [Blood and Guts (but that's from the 2012 movies)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MC7H1rOU1Gg), some generic metal and/or horror sounding stuff, and that's basically the entire OST that I can even barely remember at this point.\n\nWell actually, there was also [My Brother](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr6BMiHMPtI). Which was quite good, but for some reason every time I hear it, I just think I've heard it from somewhere else. Oh right, it's actually a remix and [from the 2012 MOVIES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVrcMRq7saA). But it's fine really. Why even try to do something new when you can just rely on the music from past adaptations? Just be sure to get Susumu Hirasawa to do at least a few songs, and then use those as much as humanly possible until people literally get sick of it.\n\nI honestly truly liked Hai Yo early on in the first season. It's literally one of the handful of reasons why I and several others stuck around. People were literally trying to construct Hai Yo each week when they played snippets of it before Hirasawa's new Berserk album with it even came out. But I can safely say despite it being a Hirasawa song, because of how much they relied on it, I wouldn't mind if I never heard it ever again.\n\nOh yeah. I almost want to genuinely applaud them for apparently at least having enough sense to go with Ash Crow with the Berserker Armor reveal. Because I genuinely was preparing myself for a completely out of place Hai Yo. Hai Yo does not fit the Berserker Armor or even the Grunbeld fight in general for that matter. It's supposed to be a fucking hugely dread and violent struggle against this gigantic Apostle fire dragon, and Guts has now been put in a suit that will essentially force him to continue fighting as his bones break because the armor _will literally dig into his flesh_ and repair his body enough to where he will still be able to move.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/BOqNWII.png)\n\nI _was_ going to applaud them, but then in the actual fight, Hai Yo starts on full blast the moment Schierke helps Berserker Guts get back in control of the armor. Like immediately the moment you can see Guts' eyes through the armor, Hai Yo starts. Yeah, no that's okay, Hai Yo definitely fits for a severe and desperate battle against an inhuman monster... or trolls, or ogres... and it also fits for when Guts steps out to brutally kill a bunch of just normal human soldiers. It fits for everything, so why not use it for __everything__. \n\nOh hey, got an idea. Here's [an idea of how Guardians of Desire (from that little unimportant arc of the manga, you know, the very first one which they mangled entirely, THE BLACK SWORDSMAN ARC) would play out if it would ever be animated (it won't) and it's animated by Milleplease and GEMBA (I hope it won't)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxnWn0JmdhI). Again as always, thanks goes out to the Berserk meme community [which yes, is a thing,](https://www.reddit.com/r/berserklejerk/) who I know for a fact LOVED Berserk 2016 and Berserk 2017 because it gave them so much material.\n\n___\n\n#Really Not Much Else Going For It Beyond the CG Monsters#\n\nI think in general, the CG for most of the monsters is fine. Some of the CG Apostles are iffy at best, but at least they got Grunbeld down okay. \n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/UpTdelx.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/57H7Rck.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/l6iIY3p.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/U681PFe.png)~~~\n\nWhich I suppose is the absolute bare minimum because when you say \"we're gonna adapt Falcon of the Millennium\" to a Berserk fan, immediately their minds are going to jump to \"Oh God, how bad is the Grunbeld fight/Berserker Armor going to look?\" and I hate to say it but... the fight itself was okay. I'd still take what [a random Berserk fan could edit together from past adaptations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_THLrGbLUAw&t=229s) over it for a billion years, though. \n\n\"The PS2 game looks better\" is not just a silly meme, holy shit. Admittedly, he also threw some of the Berserk Musou's (which came out literally thirteen years after the PS2 game) cutscenes in there for what was missing from the PS2 game.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/sGyjtYo.png)\n\n_\"There he is. The best Apostle of all of Berserk, animated. My boy, Schnoz.\"_\n\nAlso, can I just take a moment to say that... from season one, I hated Millehack and GEMBA's tendency to put credits over scenes? I didn't even bother to mention it the first time around, but this time, they actually did it with one of my favorite parts of this arc, and probably one of my overall favorite panels of Berserk in its entirety.\n\nOne of the better scenes of the episode and Berserk 2016/2017 in general, hey let's put fucking CREDITS OVER IT.\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/smetVLm.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/9l6eESD.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/djlJQe6.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/QtgyIYX.png)~~~\n\n...I really like this scene, and even how they did it. Like seeing Guts' party through Guts' eyes while in the Berserker Armor and their panicked voices being distorted... but, sure yeah, let's put the credits over this scene. No big deal. But would they have ever put credits over \"Guts fights trolls as Hai Yo gets blasted\"?\n\nNope, not in a MILLION FUCKING YEARS.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/2tU7QVB.jpg)\n\n___\n\n#The Worst Episode of Both Seasons#\n_Episode 9 or Episode 21_\n\nThere's no way this wasn't gonna get a section for itself. The very slight improvement of this season puts you off guard, and then wham. There's no excuse for this, really. Are we still at \"it's better than nothing\"? How far does the rabbit hole go?\n\nyoutube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHt3xszL9wg)\n\n_Disclaimer: That Hai Yo is for comedic effect because again, Ash Crow plays on the immediate reveal of the Berserker Armor, not Hai Yo._\n\nI honestly did not think they could top that episode in Berserk 2016 with the cult orgy which was __[really really bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUoA0xyW_vc)__. This is the episode where the Berserker Armor is revealed and it's just absolutely awful. I know that they probably saved all their money and time for the Berserker Armor itself as well as the impending Grunbeld fight (there was a recap episode the week following this episode as if to underline that fact) but oh dear god.\n\nLike obviously they were not prepared to actually have to animate Apostles all of a sudden. Especially not several in the same episode. Apostles just sort of suddenly transitioning into their Apostle forms is just... unforgivable. It's even worse that they actually did it with Zodd too. You know, [considering we've seen him transform before](https://youtu.be/h63YO1cInQM?t=4m18s)...\n\nThis episode is so bad that it honestly... like if this episode wasn't anywhere near as bad as it was, I would have probably put Berserk 2017 actually above Berserk 2016. But the overall incompetence of this episode alone has dragged it back down into the mud where it belongs with its sibling.\n\n___\n\n#Not Important To This Arc or Review At All#\n\nimg500(http://i.imgur.com/HgdljgB.png)\n\n___\n\n#The Pinnacle of Despair#\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/7ubG3oA.png)\n\n\"I can't believe they decided to end with the introduction of the cartoon pirates. The Grunbeld Fight, the Boat... both of the best spots where they could have ended it, they decided to go with the Pirates instead. I just can't believe this.

And thankfully, it seems like I won't have to.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/fQNQKnL.png)\n\nBecause if they were gonna do a season three, I don't see why they would have put \"the story continues\" because that just reads like \"just go read the manga, dudes\". This adaptation was a very mixed bag until the very end, but Berserk 2017 did... feel kind of better than Berserk 2016. But part of that for me is because again, with this season, they were starting as well as ending in Falcon of the Millennium. Berserk 2016 started with a VERY LIGHT touch of Black Swordsman stuff, and just skipped full steam to straight up Conviction. Which... infuriated, and ___still___ infuriates me.\n\nIf it wasn't for that one really trainwreck of an episode, I'd give this season like a 65 out of 100. But instead, a __6 out of 10__ is a fine. The exact same score I gave to Berserk 2016 which is admittedly still on an overall basis worse than this.\n\nSo yeah, to conclude, [go watch Teekyuu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e23qODH79c4). I genuinely only watched Teekyuu because of Berserk 2016 because I wanted to have a look into the other anime Millepensee had done and... you'd be surprised. It was pretty enjoyable and I will in fact be watching the ninth season, and I hope there are many more because I'd rather Millepensee keep going than the [ICLA guys](https://anilist.co/studio/6078/ILCA) with [Yami Shibai](https://anilist.co/anime/98978/YamiShibai5).\n\nAm I really beginning and ending a Berserk review with Teekyuu shilling? Yes, yes I am. __Teekyuu forever.__\n\n~~~img440(https://68.media.tumblr.com/efebf93a965830afd01388e91a1a7372/tumblr_nmstnqr4KR1t33d6lo1_500.gif)~~~"}, {"id": 2240, "score": 60, "body": "You might have heard of Cygames. They made [The Idolm@ster: Cinderella Girls](https://anilist.co/anime/20693/TheIdolmsterCinderellaGirls) (Joint with Bandai Namco), [Shingeki no Bahamut](https://anilist.co/anime/20590/ShingekinoBahamutGenesis), Shadowverse and, obviously Granblue Fantasy.\n\nIf you don't know, Granblue Fantasy is a turn-based mobile RPG with a gacha system. That's probably the best way to describe it simply.\n\nFair warning before we start, __this review will contain unmarked spoilers__. So if you can't take spoilers, stop reading and go do something else. Also, as this is an adaptation, I will be making some comparisons to the game and its story.\n\nSo, [A-1 Pictures](https://anilist.co/studio/561/A1Pictures), probably best known for the [Sword Art Online](https://anilist.co/anime/11757/SwordArtOnline) anime adaptation. Notably for Cygames they did [The Idolm@ster: Cinderella Girls](https://anilist.co/anime/20693/TheIdolmsterCinderellaGirls) anime adaptation. Certainly this is quite different from an idol/cute girls doing cute things anime.\n\nLet's talk about the art style and the quality of the animation. The art style seems rather rough. It feels like they didn't quite sharpen the characters. Overall the animation is fine, aside from some moments in Episodes 1 and 2.\n\nTime to talk about the main thing, the story. Until Episode 8, the anime is an almost straight adaptation of the game's story. Inside an Erste Empire airship a knight called [Katalina](https://gbf.wiki/Katalina) is taking a mysterious girl called [Lyria](https://gbf.wiki/Lyria) and escaping from the Empire. After a general named [Pommern](https://gbf.wiki/Pommern) waves a glowing purple crystal near Lyria, which seems to cause her some pain, the crystal causes an explosion on the Empire's airship which flings Lyria out of it and down to the ground below. After the OP we cut to a boy named Gran (the game's male protagonist). This farmer boy and his pet/friend, a small dragon-like-thing (that constantly reminds people that call him a lizard that he is not one) [Vyrn](https://gbf.wiki/Vyrn) see something (Lyria) falling down to the island and goes off with Vyrn to investigate. As is typical in an RPG game he takes his sword with him. Gran finds Lyria lying unconscious on the ground. After some knights of the Empire attack Gran, Katalina appears to help.\n\nIt all sounds very much like a typical Final Fantasy game doesn't it? Yeah well, this is more or less the start of the game's story.\n\nAnyway, some more things happen and so based on a letter Gran's father sent him, Gran, Lyria and Katalina set off on a journey to Estalucia, the so-called \"Island of the Astrals\". They are later joined by the airship helmsman [Rackam](https://gbf.wiki/Rackam) and the young mage [Io](https://gbf.wiki/Io).\n\nYeah, it still sounds like a typical Final Fantasy plot. You can't really blame the anime for this, as I said a few lines up, it's the game's story.\n\nHowever, as I mentioned, Episode 8 (A Pair Apart) changes things. Episode 8 is mainly a filler/side-quest episode which features the treasure hunters [Mary](https://gbf.wiki/Mary) and [Karva](https://gbf.wiki/Karva). (Actual characters you can get in the game (!))\n\nEpisode 9 (Horizon in the Clouds) goes back to the story again but decides to deviate from the game's story. In the game's story the party goes to the Auguste Isles in pursuit of the [Black Knight](https://gbf.wiki/Black_Knight) and meet the retired skyfarer [Eugen](https://gbf.wiki/Eugen) who is an old friend of Rackam. We find the Empire has come to the isles and has been polluting the oceans which annoys the local Primal Beast Leviathan. The party put a stop to the Empire's plans and beat up Leviathan and calm it down. After that the party head to the Lumacie Archipelago, meet the even more mysterious ~~JK~~ woman [Rosetta](https://gbf.wiki/Rosetta), who joins the party, and beat up and calm down the Primal Beast [Yggdrasil](https://gbf.wiki/Yggdrasil).\n\nThe anime however keeps the plot point of the Empire polluting the oceans and meeting Eugen, but the party decide to split up and do some individual tasks while Gran and Lyria explore Auguste. Two more obtainable characters, [Lowain](https://gbf.wiki/Lowain) (along with his bros Elsam and Tomoi) and [Karteira](https://gbf.wiki/Karteira), have a small voiced role. At the end of the episode Lyria is kidnapped by mysterious assailants and in Episode 10 (Separation), Pommern, for lack of a better word, mind breaks Lyria by reminding her that she is a tool. Complete with flashbacks which briefly feature the summon [Lich](https://gbf.wiki/Lich). At the same time Leviathan is clearly annoyed and is trying to flood the island. The party are saved by Rosetta (who also made brief appearances in Episodes 3 and 9) and are told that if they want to heal Lyria they'll need to accompany Rosetta to Lumacie and meet Yggdrasil. The party leaves Eugen behind to help the residents of Auguste while Leviathan is still rampaging.\n\nEpisode 11 (Lyria's Wish) starts off by showing something that the game had never shown or hinted at until not long after the episode aired: Yggdrasil can shrink herself to human-size. The episode features Gran diving into Lyria's mind to convince her that she's a friend. After healing Lyria and a brief skirmish with the Empire the party leave Rosetta and Yggdrasil and head back to Auguste. Of course Episode 12 (Showdown on the High Seas) culminates with a battle with with Leviathan.\n\nEpisode 12, however, features a multitude of playable characters; Mary and Karva return and also the episode shows (in no particular order): [Yuel](https://gbf.wiki/Yuel), [Yodarha](https://gbf.wiki/Yodarha), [Narmaya](https://gbf.wiki/Narmaya), [Silva](https://gbf.wiki/Silva), [Soriz](https://gbf.wiki/Soriz), [Jessica](https://gbf.wiki/Jessica), [Feather](https://gbf.wiki/Feather), [Charlotta](https://gbf.wiki/Charlotta) and [Zeta](https://gbf.wiki/Zeta).\n\nEpisode 13 (Another Sky) decides to do something different: A fanservice beach episode. However Gran has been replaced with Djeeta (the game's female protagonist). Djeeta offers to help a beach bar in Auguste which has run out of ice. Some more characters that are playable in the game get cameos. (This time I can't be be bothered to list and link them.)\n\nOverall, as I mentioned multiple times the plot is very much a generic Final Fantasy plot. The changes from the game's plot tries to keep it fresh for people who play the game, while still keeping a story for new people. The trouble is its too generic. The story is rather boring, honestly. I can't blame the anime for this though, this does lie as a fault with the with the game.\n\nGee, I've talked about the plot a lot, haven't I?\n\nOkay, time for something different, the music. Most of the music is taken from the game directly or is a new arrangement. (the anime does particularly seem fond of using [The Rusty Bloodline That Burns the Blue Sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djZBYZn423U). There seems to be a few small incidental tracks that are original. That isn't to say the music is bad (I actually kinda like Granblue's music). The music is mainly composed by [Nobuo Uematsu](https://anilist.co/staff/100150/NobuoUematsu) and [Tsutomu Narita ](http://vgmdb.net/artist/6443). Personally, I feel the OP and ED are forgettable.\n\nNext I feel I should talk about the voice actors. (Don't worry, the review is nearly done.) The cast is mostly the same as the games with a few exceptions: Eugen is voiced by [Kazuhiro Yamaji](https://anilist.co/staff/101755/) (Who happens to voice Yngwie in the game instead of [Keiji Fujiwara](https://anilist.co/staff/95063/KeijiFujiwara), Gran and Djeeta are usually voiceless ingame but are voiced here by [Yuuki Ono](https://anilist.co/staff/96154/) and [Hisako Kanemoto] (https://anilist.co/staff/103555/), respectively. Overall, the voice acting is spot-on, the actors are putting emotion into their lines, as they should be.\n\nOne thing I quickly want to note, is that Pommern is a lot more evil in the anime. The game shows later in the story and in a side-quest that he isnt a complete jerk and that he has his nice moments when he isn't dealing with the party.\n\nOk, final thoughts time. If you're looking for an anime to pick up, watch something else. If you're interested in Granblue Fantasy, there's plenty of vids of the gameplay and story on Youtube, watch them instead. If you're a Granblue veteran, consider only watching Episode 13 and possibly Episode 12.\n\nBy the way, the DVDs and BDs contain codes for ingame items (including exclusive items), so expect them to sell well enough for the anime to get a 2nd season.\n\n(Sorry for the length of this review, by the way.)"}, {"id": 2246, "score": 60, "body": "_Outrage Girl Shiomi_ is the sort of title that has a lot going for it but has almost as many strikes against it. It's undeniably well-made but at the same time rather hard to recommend.\n\nThe manga's central premise is that yakuza boss (they just call him a \"mob boss\" but let's be honest with ourselves, we all know what that means) Gen Shiomi, whose clique is embroiled in a mob war, gets extensive plastic surgery to disguise himself. Through the machinations of a perverted doctor he ends up looking like a high school girl (specifically, a famous idol). Fair enough, strange premises are nothing new to the medium and there are all kinds of angles you could pull out of this sort of thing.\n\nSo what frustrates about OGS is that it so frequently is decent, sometimes is good, and occasionally is great, yet also manages to fumble the ball when it comes to anything that's not specifically school-based comedy hijinks or mobster action scenes (of which there are surprisingly many and almost all of which are manga highlights). In particular, there is just enough weird out of place fanservice and just enough shitty cracks at the expense of crossdressers and transpeople that even if you're a part of neither group, it will inevitably wear on your nerves unless you're thoroughly desensitized to such things. When crossdressing schoolboy Rei is introduced and offers to take Shiomi to meet his \"friends\", it doesn't take a clairvoyant to guess (correctly) that they're depicted as gonky middle aged men in maid-themed drag. It's just rote and is honestly more sigh-worthy than actively offensive at least in the opinion of this particular transwoman, but it's frustrating nonetheless. There aren't a _ton_ of these scenes, but there are enough that it detracts greatly from the overall experience.\n\nReally that's the main problem with OGS. That if it were just slightly different--a few scenes changed or omitted, one or two characters rewritten--it would be great, and much easier to go to bat for. In its best moments it's reminiscent in tone of _One Punch Man_ in the way it seamlessly blends ridiculous physical comedy with actual serious action, but it simply falls back on laziness too often to be truly recommendable to most people and sadly, it doesn't really seem like it has an interest in pulling itself out of this holding pattern. Despite being on-point in the technical sense (I must restate again that the action scenes are a highlight and are very well done, especially anything that involves Shiomi and a katana) it has too much holding it back to be truly great."}, {"id": 2249, "score": 67, "body": "_Chio's School Road_ is a schoolgirl comedy manga with a novel premise, it bills itself as a \"dramatic extreme going to school comedy\", and indeed, the vast majority of the manga's action takes place, specifically, on our protagonist's daily journey to her house of higher learning. But, a novel premise can't carry a title on its own, so how does Chio's stack up to similar manga?\n\nLike a lot of entries into this very frantic, physical take on comedy manga, a lot of Chio's School Road's strengths lie in well-drawn closeup panels showcasing shocked expressions, ridiculous and convoluted situations played with utmost seriousness, with the occasional softer, less hectic intermission to allow the story (what of it there is) to catch up. Chio's also builds up a fairly thorough network of callbacks and recurring supporting characters who play off our protagonists in interesting ways that reward ongoing reading and make it marginally more involved than a simple 4koma might be.\n\nOur protagonists are Chio herself, a western video game otaku (she expresses outright disdain for JRPGs) and the possessor of a very overactive imagination, and her marginally more normal friend Manana who herself seems to have something of an unhealthy fixation on appearing \"normal\", \"adult\" and so on. The two have something of a vitriolic dynamic and though we're *told* that they're longtime friends, whether or not it actually *seems* that way tends to vary chapter by chapter. The tone of the manga makes their interactions something of a knife-edge walk, and while it could fairly be said to succeed more often than it fails, it does occasionally lapse into *+tic Nee-San* levels of the characters seeming to just genuinely dislike each other, which is unpleasant to say the least.\n\nThe manga tends to really shine when it focuses on Chio and her harebrained misadventures. Because of the narrow scope of the premise, many of these involve her becoming stuck in some kind of situation that requires her to essentially \"platform\" in real life. The very first chapter has her *Assassin's Creed*-ing her way through her neighborhood, and through a combination of the panels--excellently-drawn and with the architecture throughout reminiscent of how actual sandbox video game levels are sometimes designed--and Chio's goofy narration, the entire scenario is tied together really nicely. It's hilarious, and later chapters that tackle similar concepts, or related \"gamer nerd concerns\". One chapter, in a diversion from the usual premise, focuses on her staying up too late and debating the classic \"is it too late for me to go to bed and get a good night's sleep\" question with herself, in another she has an extensive argument with her Inner Hardcore Gamer (who takes the form of herself dressed in a bunch of military gear and sunglasses) about whether a clear stand-in for *Pokemon GO* is a \"shit game\" or not. \n\nManana is noteworthy too, as the deuteragonist and Chio's more level-headed counterpart. Her fixation on appearing socially normal and adult tends to get her into just as many awkward situations as Chio's otakudom does her, but the methods by which she navigates them are different. So the rare chapter that focuses on Manana, providing it doesn't make her look like an asshole (which does happen once or twice), is a different kind of highlight, and prevents things from becoming repetitive. These segments that focus on Chio and Manana are the almost indisputable highlights of the manga, and show an uncommon command of character comedy.\n\nIt's a shame then that the manga begins to fall apart a bit when it brings in characters who *aren't* Chio and Manana. Some of the supporting characters are fine--a reformed delinquent provides one of the few other effective foils for Chio--but many are rather boring and lean too heavily on stereotypes and cliches to ever rise above mild chuckle levels of humor at the absolute best of times. There's a school track star who has an exhibitionist streak, a kabadi(!) club captain who is portrayed as a predatory lesbian despite the fact that \"being a kabadi club captain\" is infinitely more interesting a character trait on its own than a stereotype that started being unacceptable decades ago, an overweight salaryman who makes so little an impression that one tends to forget he exists, and finally there is a homeless man who lives in a park near the school who seems to exist solely to crow about how sexy and awesome he thinks high school girls are. Oh, and we're told this fellow came to his current state after groping a high schooler on a train. I have a vague idea that this is *supposed* to be funny (said character is probably an author stand-in, which speaks volumes in of itself), but it's mostly just kind of stupid, especially since characters like these are a dime a dozen anymore. Occasionally a backup character will get some development to make them more interesting--such as when the school goody two-shoes (she's a member of the ethics committee, goodness) indulges her love of candy with the help of our lead girls and is later able to impress her favorite teacher, and a character who we find out is an indie idol is probably the most interesting support character in the entire manga, so it's certainly not all bad.\n\nIf some of this sounds rather ecchi for what seemed like a fairly innocuous premise, that's a bit of an issue too. Since even if you have no particular moral objection to fanservice on the conceptual level (and indeed, this reviewer does not), it's kind of out of place here especially when a number of gags rely on how allegedly homely our characters are. \n\nSo at the end of the day, _Chio's School Road_ undeniably does some things wrong. But the highlights come often enough that if you have an existing interest in this sort of story it's recommendable. Really it comes down to how well you can overlook its flaws. Buried beneath the lazy supporting characters is an expressive art style that manages to rise above many of its expression panel-focused peers, and most of all, a strong core cast who play well off each other."}, {"id": 2257, "score": 65, "body": "The following assumes familiarity with the reviewed material. Spoilers below.\n\n---\n\n---\n\nUpon completing *Flagtime* (also called *Fragtime*, no one seems to be entirely sure which is the proper translation), I was left with a feeling I find difficult to describe. Equal parts relief, disappointment, and confusion, maybe. If nothing else, *Flagtime* is a textbook example of how a late-series development can torpedo a promising first half in almost any kind of series.\n\n*Flagtime* is your usual 'schoolgirl lesbians' story with a small twist (that \"one of the girls in the couple can stop time for 3 minutes a day and bring her girlfriend with her\" qualifies as 'small' says a lot about how truly out there manga can be) and for the majority of its read time it is above all, pleasant and cute. POV character Moritani is adorably dorky and crushingly socially awkward in equal measure (using timestops to escape awkward social situations can stunt one's development as it turns out), it's more with co-protagonist Murakami that issues start to emerge, and they're unfortunately not really evident until the end of the series.\n\nMurakami is, both in-story and out, a hard girl to read. Throughout the manga Moritani wonders if she's being strung along by the other girl, even after she and Murakami begin dating and for the majority of the story it's easy to write this off as a combination of Moritani's social anxiety and the usual boneheaded lack of communication that tends to come part and parcel with romance manga both straight and gay. But....well, as it turns out, Moritani is *completely right.* She in fact *is* being strung along. We find out in Chapter 15 (in a manga that is mind you only 17 chapters long) that Murakami avoids considering her own feelings to a degree that suggests some deep-seated mental issues (and indeed earlier we learn both that one of her teachers occasionally gropes her, and that some of her \"friends\" talk about her behind her back to her knowledge), oh, *and* we find out that she keeps a literal file on everyone in her school (in the form of word card rings, the kind one uses to memorize simple math facts as a child). Including Moritani.\n\nWe're then treated to a genuinely very unsettling [four ](http://i.imgur.com/undefined.png) [page ](http://i.imgur.com/gPzZmFC.png)[long ](http://i.imgur.com/eb4zIFj.png) [sequence ](http://i.imgur.com/zQ0T17c.png)in which Murakami effortlessly cold-reads her girlfriend and makes it seem like their entire relationship has been predicated on her bizarre desire to be used for the happiness of others. It's upsetting, and by all rights, this is the point in the story where one of two things should happen. *Either*, we--the audience--have been taken for a ride and this is actually a very dark manga about the consequences of naivety and how easy it is to abuse people, *or*, more likely, Moritani and Murakami should begin the long, hard process of healing what is clearly a *quite* damaged psyche on the latter's part. It could well worm its way back to touching! With the two, both of whom have serious issues with stunted social development, bringing each other out of their shell. In this version of the manga, which perhaps exists in a parallel universe near to ours, where this manga is a good deal better and some other manga is a good deal worse, *Flagtime* is a 10-volume, comprehensive document of two girls finding happiness in each other's judgement-less love, and slowly but supportively working through their issues.\n\nI have an inkling, and it *is* just an inkling, that something not unlike this may have in fact been the original intent. Because what *actually* happens seems like a greatly, greatly abbreviated version of what I just laid out and while it's better than the alternative it does give off the vibe of something that was supposed to be a much longer and more in-depth story being rushed to a conclusion. Out of fear of being cancelled or some other factor, I cannot say. But what we're left with is a hyper-condensed mini redemption arc that just doesn't really feel believable. And while I *want* these two to have found happiness in each other, and I can buy that it *does* happen *eventually* some time some number of in-universe years after the manga ends, the actual ending we're presented with just doesn't really work. So much emotional development is crammed into the final two chapters that, when combined with dropped plot threads (such as the overly touchy teacher, the tennis club rep / mangaka Moritani befriends, and Moritani coping with the eventual loss of her powers), cancellation starts to look like the only sensible explanation.\n\nAnd it's a genuine shame. Because this is a manga that clearly tried to be something much greater than what it actually was. And that hurts, because when something aims low and is bad, that's not really surprising. When something aims *high* and greatly undershoots, it's depressing, because you can easily see how it might've been so much better. So, because it *does* ultimately end on a happy note and because it *truly does* try, and because it *does* clearly have a heart to it, *Flagtime* is hard to hate, but it's even harder to truly love, despite how much I might want to. Generally, it just leaves an impression of wasted potential and sadness at how it could've been so much better."}, {"id": 2258, "score": 50, "body": "#ALL UBW SPOILERS | Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works Review\n\n\n__Disclaimer: This is my first Fate entry__\n\nAfter the first season of UBW ended on an anti-climatic note which set up the second season, I was optimistic that the second entry in the show could do something good with an entire season\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth of build-up. I must say I am thoroughly disappointed in the second season, mainly with two points. \n\n__Major Gripes__\n\nThe Archer reveal. It sounds really awesome in concept, but the execution was horrible. Firstly, there was never a particular moment that they explicitly stated the fact that Archer is Shirou. While yes, you figure it out in your head, it being stated gives it impact, which was rightfully deserved. Secondly, the massive disconnect between the two characters makes it feel meaningless. Anything that is the Shirou we know is gone in Archer and anything of Archer we know is not present in Shirou, besides the fighting style. Thirdly, there was barely any, if any, foreshadowing regarding Archer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true identity, besides the scene right before. Shirou adopting Archer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s style is _not _ foreshadowing. Anyone would think Archer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s style is cool as fuck and want to adopt it themselves. If there was any foreshadowing, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t memorable enough for a first-time watcher to remember it upon the reveal and afterward, making the reveal feel very abrupt and sudden. Even with the reveal, the connection between Archer and Shirou is just barely there, especially given Archer isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even from the current timeline, contributing even more to the disconnect between the two. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even see any physical similarities between them. Archer has white hair, different eye shape and is much darker than Shirou. I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be surprised if they had already written up to the point of Archer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reveal and decided it would be cool that Archer was Shirou and just threw it in there, making for a lackluster plot twist. \n\nThe ending, more so Episode 24. Archer, who we saw die, with multiple swords inside of him, saves not one, but two of the main characters, and at that the only main characters still alive. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure that there is an in-universe explanation on how Archer could come back to life after dying, but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make it feel any less cheap. The two main characters had to rely on a dead man, a deus ex machina, to survive the Holy Grail War. Neither of them could accomplish what they wanted based off their own merits. The writers wrote themselves into a corner with Rin, so they had to do something for her not to die. That something wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be satisfying no matter how they did it. They needed a deus ex machina. In the event someone can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find a way to get a character to survive without the use of a deus ex machina, ~~maybe~~ they should just die. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like Rin was still important either, she had done her job, the Holy Grail War was practically over at that point and Shirou no longer needed her, so what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the problem with killing her off? Though even if she was still important, the same would be true. They could also re-write the whole scene or write it in the first place so she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get into such a situation, or write so that there is a way out that won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel forced or feel like there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bullshit in the air. The plot armor is strong until the bitter end. Furthermore, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even understand why Archer had the save Shirou. They may have written themselves into a corner with Rin but they could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve easily made the Holy Grail suck Gilgamesh in immediately rather than giving him time to chain Shirou to him. After that mess, episode 25 was solely fan service episode, feeling a need that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist, a need to see the after-story. By the end of Episode 24, the story was complete and nothing more really needed to be added to the route. If anything, Episode 25 should\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been an OVA. \n\n__Less Major Gripes__\n\nThe biggest problem with the Holy Grail War itself is the unbalance of the Noble Phantasms and the servants themselves. A servant should have drawbacks and strengths, but for some servants, they just opt for the strengths instead. Because of this, the power gap becomes too large. Berserker is an insanely OP servant, which the show makes a point of in the early episodes though he is finished by Gilgamesh, showcasing his insanely OP Noble Phantasm. Masters being unbalanced is a given and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind that at all as the Holy Grail chooses the masters. If it thinks they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re fitting, sure, they can go crazy, but the Holy Grail War itself should be a battle of skill, not raw power, so why should the Holy Grail provide servants of differing strength to everyone? If you enjoy an underdog facing the odds, as I said, the masters can be of varying experience so that would be more than enough to satisfy your needs. Additionally, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like they give weaker servants to stronger mages or vice versa. In the end, a battle of wits has much more to it than a battle of raw power.\n\nThe Heroic Spirits themselves were greatly disappointing. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a big fan of History, but the identity of the servants ended up being a side note rather than a focus or at least a detail with some amount of significance. The addition of being able to summon people from the future and different timelines means we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be lucky if we see a few memorable people of history as servants, and with appropriate Noble Phantasms at that. \n\nLastly, the antagonists in the show were all portrayed horribly. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even bother trying to have a semblance of grey morals in the story. Most if not all are shown as evil and unable to compromise or have a proper discussion with enemies, which doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make for the most compelling of antagonists. \n\n__Pros__\n\nThere were _some _ interesting things in the show. The Kotomine reveal was well done, besides the fact he also died and that he died again a few minutes later\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Illya was pretty interesting too, along with her berserker~~, mostly because she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s super cute when she says berserker~~. She seemed like someone who could be reasoned with unlike the other enemies, but, they also killed her off\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll both get their time to shine in different routes, but it was pretty disappointing we see so little of them. Perhaps this route just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t my route but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll like another. Even with everything I've said, I'm excited to watch Heaven's Feel and eventually Zero. The visuals by Ufotable were glorious as to be expected, and how could I forget Rin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thighs. \n\n__Conclusion__\nIn conclusion, Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works ends on a cheap note, having to utilize a deus ex machina while having poorly executed developments throughout and ending the interesting ones prematurely. Most importantly, thanks to Rin, I now am now sure that I like deredere more than tsundere."}, {"id": 2263, "score": 55, "body": "The following review assumes familiarity with the reviewed material. Spoilers below.\n\n---\n\nTo say that the second *Kara no Kyoukai* film--*Murder Speculation Part A*--is a bit confusing is an understatement. While the literal events that unfold aren't particularly difficult to parse, the characters enacting them have opaque and blurry motivations, which blunts any possible emotional impact and renders the entire narrative--down to its intended *tone*, confused and unclear.\n\nMurder Speculation's three main characters are Shiki, a reclusive girl who is the possible heir to her family's fortune and unknown to most is a serial killer, SHIKI, her split personality who is more rebellious and punky, and Kokutou, a shy nerd who falls for Shiki. If these descriptions seem slight, well, we're not really given much insight into their personalities and none of them really grow outside of the fairly short descriptions I've given here. We get *some* backstory wherein SHIKI tries to explain that he (I am told SHIKI uses male pronouns, and am not about to debate the gender identity of a doubly-fictional person) is in charge of Shiki's \"repressed emotions\", and in a turn of phrase that I am only very slightly paraphrasing, and is so laughably clunky I desperately want to believe it's the result of a poor translation, says that the \"only emotion [Shiki] feels is murder.\"\n\nKokutou of course finds out that Shiki is a murderess (fairly early on in fact), but it's here where the film takes a bizarre narrative turn. Rather than going to the police (he is rather close to an individual implied to be the lead investigator in the murder cases), he simply chooses not to believe her. Then, when he actually *witnesses* her murdering someone, chooses to stake out her house every night in a strange ploy to temper her murderous instincts (recall that the film frames Shiki's impulses as not being her own fault). Unbelievably, this actually *works* for quite some time, an entire fall and winter, in fact. Then, in the film's only genuine moment of suspense or action, Shiki attacks Kokutou, coming dangerously close to killing him. We're not really given much clue what happens after that. There is a timeskip near the end of the film to a few years later, where Shiki appears to be in a coma, but again the film fails to provide any reason for what occurs within it, and without proper background knowledge of the source material this entire development comes across as confusing. \n\nThere is furthermore the issue of Kokutou's character. Whether he's supposed to scan as genuinely kind and endearing (which he very much does not) or as dangerously obsessed with a woman he barely knows to the point of his own detriment (which he sort of does) isn't really clear either. This isn't an inherent problem, and in a better-executed film could be a point of intriguing ambiguity, but it doesn't seem to even be on purpose here, and rather feels more like the film either simply forgot to provide us with some kind of emotional connection to this character, or was simply uninterested in doing so in the first place.\n\nThere are certainly positives, mainly aesthetic ones. Animation studio ufotable remain as capable with pen and paintbrush as ever, and their astounding backgrounds bring a haunting sense of eeriness to scenes that desperately need *some* kind of tonework and emotion. Furthermore, the subtle visual distinction between Shiki and SHIKI, which mostly comes down to body language and some very slight design alterations to make the latter look more androgynous, are a really nice touch, as is her floaty, wraithlike movement in her confrontation with Kokutou. The soundtrack is, of course, excellent, adding another notch to Yuki Kajiura's long belt. Unfortunately none of this can excuse the seriously lacking narrative.\n\nSo what we're left with again is a movie that down to its title and its short runtime (a minute short of an hour at 59 minutes), feels like and is indeed largely *branded as* the second episode of a series rather than a proper film, but the fact remains that while it is obviously a sequel to the first KnK film at least in terms of release order, the fact that its plot takes place *earlier* in the franchise's chronology and thus neither film provides any real narrative or emotional context for the other makes it fall flat on *that* axis too. It comes across as hollow. Well-made, certainly, but without any real care as to whether you understand it or not. To be generous, it scans as a \"for fans only\" affair. There is of course the possibility that later \"episodes\" will draw on what this one has laid out, but what that essentially means is that this particular film is, on its own, all buildup and no resolution."}, {"id": 2280, "score": 60, "body": "Before jumping straight into the review I have a strong need to talk abou the \u00e2\u0080\u009canime vs. manga\u00e2\u0080\u009d thing. Most people think that the anime is bad just because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a faithful transposition of the manga. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a really bad argument to me. Is true that the director of the anime (actually because he dislikes the manga) made some consistent changes to the plot, but this is not sufficient to say that the animated version of Bokurano is bad. According to my idea in cases like this we should consider the manga and the anime as two separate entities; with one born from the other. Thus the fact that the anime isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t faithful to the original plot does not prove that it is a bad anime. It is not a case that director Hiroyuki Morita wrote on his blog \u00e2\u0080\u009cFans of the original, please do not watch the animated version from now on\u00e2\u0080\u009d. With this stated let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s jump to the main matter.\n\n~~~img700(https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b7IJEI3vZzs/maxresdefault.jpg)~~~~~~Characters of Bokurano with their chairs, an important element in the series even cited in other works (like PMMM)~~~\n\nI had great expectations for Bokurano since it was suggested to me as an anime with great dark tones, surprising effect and drama; all things that, when well done, I definitely enjoy. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not ashamed of saying that the first episodes really catched on me: I think that I rushed something like 8 episodes in a single day (that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unusual to me). The first part of the show is well done: dark tones are settled correctly and the reactions of the characters are surprisingly real. I was so hyped for it that, the next day, I watched something like 13 episodes all in one time and, as I was going on, Bokurano slowly started to lose me. I found the anime to have two main problems at that point:\n\n- __The drama is poor__: nobody really feel sad for victims of terrorist attacks. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because you do not know the people who died, you do not care for them. Something similar is applicable to animation: if you want to make some good drama you have to make the viewer cares about your characters. In Bokurano this is done horribly: most of the characters receive a backstory/characterization and die in the same episode or in the next one. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not saying that is impossible to make you care about a character in a single episode but rather that Bokurano failed in doing it. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll easily find yourself saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, X died, who cares?\u00e2\u0080\u009d several times during the anime.\n\n- __The cast is too vast__: 15 children is a huge number. And even if children are supposed to die during the anime they are immediately replaced by other characters. For most part of the show you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find yourself dealing with some children, a couple of guys from a military association, politicians and even some scientists. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a whole mess! This is connected to the point above: with lots of characters you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re less likely to care about them. Not to mention the fact that is literally impossible to remember every character name; that will make you say \u00e2\u0080\u009cWait a minute, who is X?\u00e2\u0080\u009d quite a bit (especially during \u00e2\u0080\u009cremembering the dead friend\u00e2\u0080\u009d scenes). I also want to say that I used \u00e2\u0080\u009cX\u00e2\u0080\u009d instead of a character name in those examples because I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t barely remember a single name; and I finished the show two days ago, not two years ago.\n\n~~~img700(https://terminaato.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bokurano_7.jpg)~~~~~~Koemushi, the \"bad guy\"~~~\n\nThen the final episodes arrived and my disappointment becomes even more real. I think the anime have some serious problems here:\n\n- __The masterminds__: at some point during the last 5 episodes a guy discovers the existence of masterminds. Who they are? How do they interact with the story? We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. The anime really  tell us nothing about a concept that is supposed to be really important and even the key to understand the whole worldbuilding of the series. This is probably well explained in the manga but, as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said above, the anime is a whole different work. I actively think that it would have been better for Morita to never include masterminds in the anime at all.\n\n- __Koemushi and Machi backstory__: this is another thing that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supposed to be important and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s developed poorly. I mean, Koemushi is the \u00e2\u0080\u009cevil guy\u00e2\u0080\u009d that tricked the children to pilot Zearth, I wanted to know more about it and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s backstory but the whole thing was rushed in something like half an episode. I needed to rewatch that segment a second time to actually grasp all the useful information and I felt like I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t had enough.\n\nAbout the finale: I actually saw the finale coming two/three episodes before. Really, really predictable for an anime that was actually capable of surprising me several times during its early episodes. I do not think this finale is necessary bad but I can think of a better one, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s usually a thing that happen with finales that does not satisfy me at all. It was that sort of \u00e2\u0080\u009cmhe\u00e2\u0080\u009d finale to me: nothing too god, nothing too bad.\n\nAbout minor stuff: really great opening (with a [fantastic remix from DJ Sharpnel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZOef38-BzY), if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re into the genre) and overall idea (even if this last point isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually a thing about the anime but more about the original manga). Despite the points above I do not hate the show, but rather I had a nice time watching it: if I could travel back in time I would not tell myself to not watch it.\n\n~~~youtube (8SGmjBrHArQ)~~~"}, {"id": 2281, "score": 50, "body": "The following review assumes familiarity with the reviewed material, spoilers below.\n\n----\n\nOne of the challenges of criticism is that it's not always easy to explain *why* something works or doesn't. Sometimes this can actually almost be a positive, marking something as a \"so good you have to see it for yourself\" sort of experience, but sadly the opposite is the case with *Expelled From Paradise*, a bafflingly dull CGI film produced by Toei Animation, directed Seiji Mizushima, animated by Graphinica, and with a screenplay by Gen Urobuchi. It is a failure from all parties, expected in some cases, surprising in others.\n\nThe simple fact of the matter is that above all else, *Expelled From Paradise* is awkward. Deeply, *deeply* awkward. In a way that'll be all too familiar for anyone who has watched anime for any length of time. A solid half of EFP is exposition, and at that, exposition about things that you, the audience, cannot reasonably be expected to care about. EFP's exposition is not unlike a lecture from the driest history professor imaginable, except instead of learning about actual, real history, and its tangible impacts, you are learning about \"the Nanocaust\" (seriously), and the construction of various colony ships. It's material that, better handled, could be genuinely interesting, but the presentation here is beyond flat, and it's difficult to muster up any particular emotion about the backstory, about 5 minutes after we learn of \"The Nanocaust\" we're introduced to something that dates to before it, which is clearly intended to be a revelation, but because of the clipped structure it simply doesn't *feel* that way.\n\nThe film is also preoccupied with a strange anti-technology agenda. A sharp contrast is made between our two leads, DEVA-employed cybercop Angela, and her Earth-bound, \"rugged\" (I use the term loosely), and of course male counterpart Dingo. The two barely have personalities, and really are more stand-ins for the philosophies they represent on the whole. Dingo's is fairly clearly defined. He's a natural, free-living sort, who likes rock and roll and drives a jeep (for the second time in this review I must emphasize, yes seriously). Angela's is much murkier, and while her near-blind loyalty to DEVA and its administrators is persistent throughout the first half of the film (where most of this moralizing takes place), the actual content of her philosophy shifts several times from conversation to conversation to the point that it's kind of hard to say what, really, she's meant to stand for. There are a handful of times that EFP comes close to making something like an actual *point*, a conversation in the film's middle in particular seems like it might be headed toward a veiled condemnation of capitalism--which, hey, is something--but then veers, and Dingo makes the absolutely baffling declaration that life on Earth, which he defines as being driven by pure luck, is better than life on DEVA, a sort of harsh meritocracy. At the end of the day *neither* character comes across particularly well in this department, which is frustrating because again, both seem like they *could* be interesting in other circumstances, handled better and propped up by better writing. Here, they are caricatures, and worse, it's not even clear caricatures *of what.*\n\nIt must be mentioned that the dialog being rigor mortis-stiff contributes a lot here. No one--past, present, or future--says aloud things like \"we should consider not only the defense ramifications, but public opinion\" in emotion-driven, spoken speech. Whether this can be attributed to translation or the writing itself is ambiguous, but to say that it comes across as wooden is an insult to the many fine uses--both practical and decorative--of wood itself.\n\nThe AI introduced in the film's second half (revealed to be Frontier Setter from the introduction) is actually the film's most *charming* character by far, if simply because he isn't meant to grandstand for some kind of moral agenda, and has no stance--at least not one we're given--on the Earth-lander/DEVA conflict (plus: at one point he remixes a song, which has to count for something). But by the time he's developed, the film is already nearing its end, having already been crushingly boring for a solid half of its runtime.\n\nSo is the film without redeeming qualities? No, for one thing, most of these complaints are about the film's first two-thirds. By its final stretch it effectively becomes a different movie entirely, as the focus shifts from Dingo and Angela on their mission to Angela and Frontier evading the forces of the DEVA ship. The plot takes a firm backseat to the action here, and the battles between Angela and the DEVA mechas are cool enough that you wish there were more of them in the film. Sadly, EFP can't avoid itself, and the film ends in disappointing and predictable fashion (Angela chooses to remain on Earth with Dingo instead of leaving to the stars with Frontier) and in the end the entire experience feels like it was for nothing in particular.\n\nOn top of that there are so many minor quibbles. Angela's body being explicitly pointed out as physically 16 for no good reason, the fact that Frontier has a guitar strapped to his back for much of the second half of the film despite not having hands, one of the film's last shots being a shot of a baseball cap falling to the ground, Dingo singing a shitty guy-with-an-acoustic version of the ending credits theme (itself pleasant enough) before the real one kicks in, the *absolutely baffling* decision to set so little of the film in cyberspace despite it starting there and cyber-psychadelia being an obvious choice for depicting in a full-CGI film. Lastly there are the intangibles, EFP simply doesn't *feel* correct. Shots linger for just too long or cut just too quickly, the dialogue isn't laughably terrible but not a single memorable line is spoken, the animation is competent but never rises above \"JRPG Cutscene\" excepting the final confrontation, and really, nothing interesting happens! At the end of the day *Expelled From Paradise* is a *profoundly* average piece of media. It is technically competent on a basic level, and has no glaring shortcomings in terms of literal execution, it tells a story that progresses from start to end more or less coherently, but these are all *very low* bars to clear. *Expelled From Paradise* commits the double sin of both not aspiring to be anything particularly interesting, and failing to even fully fulfill its already conservative ambitions. If it is recommendable on any level, it's as a baseline, in many ways, EFP is too bland and too competent to be truly terrible, and in that sense it is genuinely almost exactly average. If you could create a computer capable of generating anime films from scratch, *Expelled From Paradise* is the sort of thing it might come up with. Technically proficient, but on every artistic level, it simply isn't anything interesting."}, {"id": 2296, "score": 60, "body": "Hey. Do you remember Jaws?

That one movie with a bunch of people on a space station that get murdered by a badass alien monster ~~(which was of course really just a goddamned guy in a fucking suit, __MOVIE MAGIC__)~~?\n\n_Jaws set the template for many subsequent horror films, to the extent that the script for Ridley Scott's 1979 science fiction film Alien was pitched to studio executives as \"Jaws in space\". Scott would later reveal in a 2017 interview that Jaws had made a lasting impression, \"I was always put off from swimming ever since I watched Jaws,\" says Scott. \"I quite liked swimming, actually, and I'd occasionally dive, but once I saw Jaws there was no way I was ever going to learn to surf \u00e2\u0080\u0093 no way!

Tomie, Tomie: Another Face, Tomie: Replay, Tomie: Re-Birth, Tomie: The Final Chapter - Forbidden Fruit, Tomie: Beginning, Tomie: Revenge, Tomie vs Tomie, and finally in 2011, Tomie: Unlimited).\n\n~~Source for all the Tomie film titles: AGAIN.

Perhaps just one day he watched Jaws, and said hey, I want to do a manga of that! Or... actually, maybe he just realized he hadn't done a manga featuring fish yet. The result? \n\nimg440(https://graphicpolicy.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/gyodeluxeedition.jpg)\n\n__GYO!__ ATTACK OF THE DEAD FISH HORDES FROM OKINAWA. THESE ROTTING SMELLING FISH ARE DRAGGING THEMSELVES OUT OF THE WATER TO STRIKE BACK AGAINST US, THE FILTHY LAND DWELLERS. IT'S LIKE JAWS, BUT UNLIKE JAWS, THE SHARKS ARE COMING ON LAND!!! __OH MY G[O](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyophYBP_w4)D!__\n\nJaws is a classic. Gyo is not. Gyo is just the product of a day when Junji Ito said \"hey I feel like drawing some fish and weird shit\" and that's perfectly okay. Don't know why it was a long series. It would have been perfect if it was just the ONE chapter where the shark on spider legs bursts through the wall. \n\nBut unfortunately, we're not here to talk about Junji Ito's vision of rotting monster fish attacking people. We're here to talk about [some guy](https://anilist.co/staff/102247/TakayukiHirao)'s vision of his take on Junji Ito's vision of rotting monster fish attacking people.\n\n...This review is not about the Junji Ito manga Gyo, but the 2012 anime OVA, Gyo.\n\n_...I'm so sorry._\n\n___\n\n#One of the worst adaptations I've ever fucking seen#\n\nimg440(https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDFjZGEzN2MtMjg1OS00ODcxLTkwNzMtMmJjYTg2ZjEyZjdhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1OTYxNzU@._V1_UY1200_CR85,0,630,1200_AL_.jpg)\n\nIf I haven't gotten the message through, the original Gyo wasn't exactly a masterpiece in any sense. Rotting killer fish, it gets kind of weird because how do you stretch rotting killer fish to twenty chapters, that's just what it is and not much more. But then ten years later, a little studio named [Ufotable](https://anilist.co/studio/43/ufotable) and a man named [Takayuki Hirao](https://anilist.co/staff/102247/TakayukiHirao) came along and said \"HEY, we'll animate that shit!\" and oh boy. What a terrible fucking idea.\n\nTakayuki Hirao directed, did the storyboards for, and wrote the script for this... this take on Gyo. He took the story and decided rather than the guy, the girlfriend should be the protagonist. Right out of the gate, THE PROTAGONIST OF THE ORIGINAL STORY IS NO LONGER THE PROTAGONIST. Hell, the whole original story is the guy and his girlfriend going to this cabin together. In the adaptation, _he's not even there_.\n\n...What? But that's the whole thing. She can't just be in the cabin alone--\n\n__UFOTABLE__: \"GOOD NEWS! NOW INTRODUCING TWO BRAND NEW ORIGINAL GYO CHARACTERS! BECAUSE YOU KNOW IN HORROR, THAT WHOLE THING WHERE A BUNCH OF FRIENDS GO TO A [CABIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evil_Dead) IN THE [MIDDLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Voorhees) OF [NOWHERE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cabin_in_the_Woods).

That sounds fucking terrible and completely pointless. What is the point of horribly and purposely ruining a Junji Ito manga? The original Gyo is silly and weird enough on its own just do a faithful and true adaptation! The guy and girl going there as a couple was way more interesting than... _that_. Her phobia of horrible smells was more interesting than that! Additionally, how is she going to even work as the protagonist with her phobia--\n\n__UFOTABLE__: \"OH NO, WE AXED THAT. WE HAD TO. SURE, THAT WAS HER ENTIRE CHARACTER, __BUT FUCK IT__.\"\n\nYou know, I don't think \"__BUT FUCK IT__\" should be used for literally every creative decision in a creative project especially when adapting someone else's shit. But that's just me. Whatever, we need to get back on topic.\n\nSo after the one friend character goes to have sex with two random guys in the other room, that's when the CG shark shows up and the horror meter __skyrockets to eleven__.\n\n~~~img440(http://pa1.narvii.com/5777/0d9373f91d5fff8336638b9d7e997faa097a4764_hq.gif) img440(http://i.imgur.com/A9s8H0f.gif)~~~\n\n...\n\n___...___\n\n__UFOTABLE__: \"...\"\n\nimg220(http://i.imgur.com/wWG3i9l.png)\n\n___\n\n#Conclusion#\n\nThis huge steaming pile of shit was how I was first introduced to Junji Ito. Quite frankly, I couldn't believe what I was watching. Laughed through quite a bit of it. My reaction to it as a big horror fan was... I needed to see more. I needed to look up the original creator and read all of his things because I was not previously aware of this person's existence. That's exactly what I did. \n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/D1qooA0.png)\n\nYou too can download the entire Junji Ito collection at LINK RE[DA](http://i.imgur.com/IHx2Kf8.png)CTED. I of course started with the manga version of Gyo and was surprised to find that... well... comparatively, it was the best thing ever? As a main character, the boyfriend is stronger (although as previously said, she was more interesting in the manga even if her role wasn't main character), I was surprised ~~and PLEASED~~ to find Kaori's friends didn't even EXIST in the manga.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/u8sZ7EI.png)\n\nThe shark's a lot more imposing and intimidating in the manga... then again, the black and white of manga is fucking intertwined with Junji Ito's style. I'm not sure if that even makes sense. To reword, I don't really think color and Junji Ito's monsters work together. But I'm honestly not sure if it's just because of Gyo the anime. Everything is just so colorful and bright...it's just... ugh.\n\n[Hypothetically, if there's ever another Junji Ito adaptation](https://anilist.co/anime/99940/ItoJunjiCollection), I hope they bring animation that's a bit closer to Junji Ito's style and go a bit less... bright.\n\n__UFOTABLE__: \"THAT'S NOT FAIR. IT'S TOO BRIGHT IS ONE OF YOUR CRITICISMS? BUT WE ADDED A BRAND NEW OCTOPUS MONSTER. THE MANGA DIDN'T HAVE AN OCTOPUS.\"\n\nWait, did you?

Despite being completely off the rails, this adaptation still works in some stuff that's actually from the manga. They actually do more or less do the plot even if the main characters are switched. They even animate the bizarre as shit circus scene which is about when the final nail of the coffin of me checking out all of Junji Ito's other stuff was nailed in. \n\nLike seriously what the fuck. We started with rotting fish monsters, now rotting fish monsters are infecting people to become horrifically ugly bloated gas spewing monsters, and now there's just a fucking circus for some reason.\n\n~~~img440(http://i.imgur.com/0k9OAEu.png) img440(http://i.imgur.com/E7rSWpx.jpg) img440(http://i.imgur.com/WUH7pgT.jpg) img440(http://i.imgur.com/2kV07A4.png)~~~\n\nI know Junji Ito draws _whatever_ the fuck he wants _whenever_ the fuck he wants and that's a reason why I love him, but what the fuck. The rotting fish infect humans and turn them into blob creatures that spew gas, and if that gas is lit on fire, it turns into screaming nightmarish ghost faces that can't be captured on camera? What??? What the fuck does any of this have to do with sharks on spider legs???\n\nTo conclude, I give Gyo the animation a __6 out of 10__. I do not recommend watching it, but I do recommend giving the manga a try. Like yeah okay, the OVA is a pretty funny watch as it's pretty bad in comical ways, but so is the manga itself and the manga actually provided more genuine enjoyment.\n\n__UFOTABLE:__ \"Wait, what the fuck?\"\n\nWhat?\n\n__UFOTABLE:__ \"You said this was one of the worst adaptations you've ever seen! A fucking six out of ten???\"\n\nIt made me laugh a huge amount. The negativity only really crept in after when I read the manga which is still bad and funny, but way better than this. THE GIRLFRIEND IS LITERALLY CHASED BY ONE OF THE FISH MONSTERS BUT THE GUY PUT IT IN A TIED UP GARBAGE BAG. WHERE WAS THAT SCENE? THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HILARIOUS TO SEE ANIMATED.\n\nHad time to include anime original characters, an anime original octopus, but nope. Bag fish gets shafted. It's not right. IT'S NOT RIGHT.\n\nimg440(http://i.imgur.com/TIuXLHp.png)\n\n__UFOTABLE:__ \"A six out of ten isn't even a bad score.

Not to say I didn't enjoy this because I did and I would probably buy it again because so far all of Junji Ito's manga's physical forms have been neat. Like with this, on the cover, the sibling characters actually come out of the cover a little bit which is a neat little thing. Then you have [Fragments of Horror](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1yWhrWyRQL.jpg) which is like this Junji Ito version of that [ONE PAINTING](http://images.mentalfloss.com/sites/default/files/ahh.png?resize=1100x740), but like if the light hits the cover or the back just right, you can see like fucking typical Junji Ito nightmare creatures beneath of both sides.\n\nNot to mention, all three of Junji Ito's \"long series\" are matching hardbacks, and everyone knows that hardbacks are superior to paperbacks. __THEY'RE SUPERIOR.__\n\nManga/book nerd-ery aside, this is one of the exceptions of Junji Ito's collections. All chapters are connected and/or there are at least one or two key central characters that are throughout all chapters. You have this weird pair of siblings that move from house to house after shit goes down in each chapter.  The older brother is tall and wears glasses, and the younger sister asks a girl to let her suck her brains like within the first ten pages.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/gitBSng.png)\n\nThe sister just shows up and stares at the girl for three pages, and then bam, on the fourth page we're right into it. The brother has done nothing but apologize, whereas the sister just chases a girl out into the street to get hit by a truck and oh, the brother shows up and apologizes because the girl with a creepy face is his sister and he blames his sister taking on an evil streak on him killing small animals because of his parents arguing, and SHE IS POSSESSED BY ONE OF THE SNAKES HE KILLED WITH A ROCK.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/Ntrz1tP.png)\n\nThen the girl is like okay, I'm gonna go befriend your sister because apart from the creepy face, she's probably not all bad. But then the sister is like, no you got it all wrong, my brother is actually a Satanist and he keeps our parents' partially melted heads in a closet, and his apologies are in fact to Satan or a demon and they cause other people to melt basically.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/5kA6Oea.png)\n\n_\"EXCUSE ME MISS, DO YOU HAVE A TISSUE? OUR BRAINS SEEM TO BE COMING OUT OF OUR NOSES, MOUTHS, EYES, AND OUR EARS. IT'S A SERIOUS FUCKING PROBLEM.\"_\n\nThen the girl becomes self-aware of the fact that she is in a Junji Ito manga and that both siblings are fucking completely out of their fucking gourds, so she does the smart thing and just fucking runs away but it turns out everyone in the entire school has already melted. But the guy is still chasing her because he really wants her to accept his heartfelt apologies that for some reason seems to melt everyone's brains. She manages to escape total brain melting but apparently her brain still melted enough to where while she's still alive, she's basically brain dead. And her parents who met the brother before and were thus apologized to are also dead. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/ziG6KxR.png) \n\nI own the actual physical copy of this and the dialogue is translated differently. In the official translation, it's actually more insane? \"My brother's apologies make people's brains melt. It must be the evil electromagnetic waves passing between him and the Devil!\"\n\nElectromagnetic... waves? What???\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/yrICILM.png)\n\nSo the first chapter or story with these fucked up siblings ends with an entire school of people's brains melted, and our first protagonist is left braindead and alone. The siblings move away to melt innocent people's brains for another day. Actually, they move to another location literally after almost every chapter.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/oc1yrlP.png)\n\n___\n\n#Conclusion#\n\nNot my favorite Junji Ito manga, but it was fun overall. A __6 out of 10__! There is a little bit more that happens than literally just people melting, but I'll leave that to your imaginations. I just wanted to review this one because out of all of the ones I've read, this is the one where Junji Ito was the loosest as far as plot went. And also Satan's electromagnetic waves aside, it IS pretty weird to just do a manga where people melting is the entire thing.\n\n\"Oh, the creepy sister is evil and possessed by a snake the brother killed. Oh, the brother is actually a Satanist and for some reason if he apologizes to people, their brains melt. Oh, the brother and sister are now fighting, maybe they'll end up turning on each other--oh no, that didn't happen. Oh, the brother is still denying everything his sister is saying and is instead blaming it all on the sister... oh, it's over. WHOOPS, THE ENDING LITERALLY JUST SAID OKAY YOU DECIDE WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SIBLINGS IN THE END SO NO RESOLUTION. _Granted, given all the chaos at the end, I'd probably say they're dead._\"\n\nWeird, nasty, disgusting, and ugly. My type of Junji Ito manga. To conclude this review, here's a parting sneak peek at one of the other chapters of this. Sorry!\n\nDon't worry, your brain will be fine. _Because I'm not actually sorry.

Why exactly is it dangerous, and in what manner? But also, can it help you, and if so, then how? But perhaps most shockingly, it ponders - what if it's neither good nor bad? Why not just treat it as a lifestyle choice?\n\nWhile the individual scenarios are fairly simple and chliched, the picture painted by the entirety of the show is slightly more intricate. In fact, the worsted compiled by all the individual plot threads is so tangled, that the series doesn't even try crocheting the final chapter out of it. Instead it abandons the topic of escapism and devotes the last few episodes to its internal mythology. It's a hard decision to judge, and part of me wishes the show had just stuck with its major theme till the end. But in a sense such shift really does fit this kind of story. In the end, the task of combining all the answers and extracting thoughts on escapism is left to the viewer.\n\nThis isn't the only unusual story structure decision made by the show, as some of the messages left by individual episodes feel contradictory, as if they are meant to dare the viewer to disagree. In particular, the episode where protagonist tells a character to give up on her wishes and stop escaping her destiny comes to mind. In that sense the series feels thought-provoking, as it touches on big ideas, but absolves itself from responsibility of moralising. Instead it just rummages the topic and leaves the task of cleaning it up to volounteering viewers.\n\n~~~img220(http://blog.tanuki.pl/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/0-5.jpg)~~~\n\nWhat it does put effort into is maintaining the dream-like atmosphere in all its facets. For example, there's big focus on leaving things unsaid. Open endings and unanswered questions are one thing, but what's more important are details such as the method in which professor Kanzaki enters the dream world, or how he brought his device that allows communication with real world into it, or the mechanics of what happens when Haruto falls asleep inside the dream world. None of that is explained or brought up, it just gets accepted for what it is. \n\nIn similar vein the show sometimes breaks one of the golden rules of storytelling, when it connects consecutive story beats with dreaded \"and then\", rather than usually preferable \"therefore\" and \"but\". This is the main tool used to make the dreamlike stories feel, well, dreamlike. After all, dreams rarely make sense. They operate on their own internal logic that works while you're inside of them, but is jarring from the outside perspective. Moreover, characters will sometimes try to make sense of the world's rules and question certain events, but usually they just accept things as they happen, which is another characteristic of specifically oniristic narration, rather than fully abstract.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle is the use of different animation styles (along with different directors) for each episode. Between melancholic episode 3, fable-like episode 7 and narratively-experimental episode 8, every dream world has its own distinct feel, immediately setting the tone of the story and telling us a lot about the type of person whose domain it would be. Solid pacing and good audio mixing further help in immersing us into these worlds, and sometimes the series hits some serious highs.\n\n~~~img220(http://www.animefeminist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18if1-24-1024x576.png)~~~\n\nHowever, I find it really hard to rank it. For instance, I wonder whether I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m giving creators too much credit by assuming that the ham-fisted final was intentional. I also have to say that most of the series has very few interesting observations. It will make a funny comment about idol world here or bring up an unusual topic there, but then it just gets acknowledged and show moves on, making no impact on the way. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no doubt in my mind that there are plenty dream stories more worthwhile (Paprika for one). But at the very least, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rare to see one with \u00e2\u0080\u009cmonster of the week\u00e2\u0080\u009d formula.

But what she really wants is for her friend to fall in love for who she really is... without the magical hairpiece to change her appearance.~~~ \n<br>\n#~~~Story and Characters~~~#\n<br>\n~~~ Lan Mo De Hua is a Chinese romance anime, only 9 episodes long,  about a teenage girl who wants to date her high-school sweetheart but can't find the right way to tell him that she loves him. \n<br>\nThe anime's backstory can be quite deep when you think about it with an open mind. Lan Mo buys a magical hairpiece that can make her look more like her lover's ideal dream girl. This works for a while until Lan Mo realizes that she wants her friend to love her for who she really is and not pretending to be someone else...\n<br>\nThere are only 2 main characters in the entire anime; Lan Mo, who is the cute and goofy main girl who can transform into her crush's dream girl. The other main character is Lui Yi Feng, the oblivious childhood friend of Lan Mo who only sees her as a friend. There are other characters but are mostly very forgettable.\n<br> ~~~\n~~~img220(https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EV8wXzMi4uU/maxresdefault.jpg)\n~~~\n<br>\n#~~~Art and Animation~~~#\n<br>\n~~~The artwork is decent, not quite as extensive or as detailed as Japanese anime but sufficient nonetheless. The chibi art is especially cute however! I was surprised with this specific art style, It could blend in for a Japanese anime if I didn't know otherwise.\n<br>\nMost of the background art looks like the producers took a random photograph and then placed it inside the anime to make it look more like anime. Whether or not you think this is good or just lazy, is up to you to decide. \n<br>\nThe animation needs help in some scenes, all I can say is that the anime company is making a lot of anime recently and that this certain anime they skipped some important parts. Some of which is fine, but I wish they could have improved on the lip-sync animation - sometimes the mouths move when the characters are not speaking... Everything else is fine though.~~~\n<br>\n#~~~Sound, Music and Voice Acting~~~#\n<br>\n~~~The sound effects was relatively average in respect. But what I can say for sure was the music was calm and peaceful, just what you would expect from a romance anime to have relaxing music. The music is naturally more energetic during dramatic moments, of course.\n<br>\nListen everyone, I am going to say this now... _this anime is made in China so of course, there will be Chinese voices_. Often people complain about Chinese voices in anime but that is only because they are not used to hearing the language... I don't see why people complain about this, it's the original language so it must get some respect from the people who watch it?\n<br>\nSubtitle quality can depend however... I watched it in Chinese with English subtitles and overall it was a very good subtitle quality by Guodong Subs. Some people have complained that the subtitles don't make logical sense but I thought they made perfect sense.~~~\n<br>\n\n#~~~Final Thoughts~~~#\n<br>\n~~~If you are a fan of romance or shoujo anime then you might like this. It's a really under-watched anime since not many people have watched this or have even heard of it. But I can be sure you will find the story to be sweet or at least heartwarming towards the end of the anime.\n<br>\nThe bad thing about this anime is that there lacks any real story plot except the main character's interaction with each other. The creators do try to place the main characters in situations where you would think they would become closer but instead they save it until later on in the anime, which is a real shame.  Then again, maybe that's what was supposed to have happened?\n<br>~~~\n~~~Thank you for reading my first review! If you see any mistakes then please let me know.

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s often used as a motif in stories of young adults having trouble finding themselves and still longing for those school days, but also as the symbol of inevitability for freshman and sophomores who ponder about the flow of time and come to realize how soon their youth will end.\n\nBut it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suprisingly rare to see a story that actually focuses on the very last stage of student life, those last few months of senior year, when it becomes apparent how different everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lives will become soon. Some people already have their college recommendations, others are busy studying for exams, and there are even those who are already done with their education and will join the workforce immediately after receiving their diploma. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the twilight of high school, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at the crossroads of how you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll begin your adulthood. On one hand it feels like being suspended between these two completely different phases of your life, on the other it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the last minute to do the things you can only do now, before moving on. Confess love to your long-time crush, rethink your career path. Try to find a surrogate for the achievement you were never able to accomplish, in hopes of having fewer hang-ups going forward.\n\n~~~img220(https://i.imgur.com/ahF5dHz.png)~~~\n\nJust Because is brimming with the atmosphere of fleeting time. Between washed-out color palette, grounded designs and quiet, calm soundtrack, the show drowns the viewers in nostalgia and melting mood. The timeframe of late autumn-early winter definitely helps in creating a very somber, but warm and charming story. It can also feel very personal and touching at times, thanks to detailed animation of faces and gestures. This show associates a particular taste with this time period, a taste not everyone will recall from their own last few months of high school, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so palpable here that almost everyone should be able to empathize with some of the characters in one way or another.\n\nOn a different note, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth mentioning that this is first and foremost a love story. Some kids have feelings for one another, which they explore and decide how to act upon. Perhaps all I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been writing about, the atmosphere, the theme, are just a window dressing for the events of love lives of a couple of teenagers. But for me, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the exact opposite - the drama is just there to drive the plot, while main focus is on those little touches, background events and other aspects of the show, that combined together create its mood. \n\nThe characters aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very complex, largely defined by just few traits and interests, but there is some nuance to at least a few of them. The relationships between them seem to work largely on the things unsaid, and on how they dance around topics and keep thoughts for themselves, afraid of the other party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reaction. This leads to a lot of nice, subdued moments, and a few emotional outbursts which appear powerful by contrast.\n~~~\nimg220(https://i.imgur.com/2E4O7CD.png)~~~\n\nAll this results in quite a unique show. Between the unexpectedly rare timeframe, lowkey drama and nostalgia oozing out of every moment, Just Because manages to find its niche in the everbusy high-school-slice-of-life genre. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hardly revolutionary, but it delivers on its promise and I could definitely see it being exactly what people longing for their high school days might be looking for. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comfy as hell, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as much as anyone could ask of such show."}, {"id": 2338, "score": 50, "body": "Moved a bit slow for my tastes, and I like slow-moving stories that build with a payoff. There's no real payoff here for one of our couples. While the opening of the series leads you to believe there will be many characters and couples, there's really only four main characters/two couples. One couple's romance is fun to watch and the other's is a bit slow without being intriguing. I don't mind a slow burn, but it felt really aimless until halfway through the series when things start actually moving in a direction for both couples.\n\nThe supporting characters get a few minutes of airtime, but their storylines are opened up without any real end. Several of their storylines left me wondering what was going to happen with them; it felt like sloppy storytelling. And for a series titled 'Konbini Kareshi' I kept wondering why the school was more of a focal point than the convenience store. Far more scenes take place at the school than at the convenience store, which makes me wonder why the title is so misleading.\n\nI was really surprised at how cruddy the animation was in this; I guess I shouldn't be surprised, Studio Pierrot takes shortcuts (look at Naruto's action scenes), but it's like they put all their junior animators on this and didn't review anything. There's a scene where Misaki's legs/pants are drawn so poorly in episode 12 that it looks like someone forgot to actually do the outline properly, it looks like a sketch. You can't tell if she's wearing hot pants, her legs are malformed or she has on pants. (She has on pants.) Every character's motion is odd too, there was nothing smooth about it and every time someone would run, or play a sport, it was jarring.\n\nI also didn't care for the character design. I found the eyes on the boys odd, the design was fine for the women, but for the male characters, each close-up of their face just reminded me how much I disliked the character designs. The color palettes in each and every frame are pleasing, but backgrounds and scenery lack life and detail.\n\nThe 'fun' couple are the only saving grace of this series.

The only difference being the use of \"Land\" instead of \"Country\".\n\n-----\n\nThere's really only so much you can do with a reboot. You can try to re-create the original series faithfully, you can try to update it to better suit a modern audience, or you can split the difference and try to do a bit of both. Broadly, all reboots fall into one of these categories. The 2017 adaptation of *Kino's Journey* is very much in the third.\n\n *Kino's Journey* if you're not familiar, is a traveler story (a genre defined by a protagonist who goes place to place, untethered to any locale they visit, who is usually superhumanly skilled in some area, often combat-related, and serves as a hero or antihero to the places they visit, usually solving the locals' problems or at least, meaningfully impacting things in a large way) revolving around Kino, an androgynous traveler skilled with firearms of all types, and Hermes, her talking motorcycle (for reasons that have never been explained and maybe don't need to be, the German term *motorrad* is used unilaterally throughout the *Kino* franchise). *Kino* is actually a surprisingly large franchise, consisting of the original light novels, a *very* well-regarded anime from 2003, two separate manga, several visual novels, a handful of animated movies, and late last year a second TV anime. Kino herself even appeared in a fighting game at one point, as an assist character. So there is no shortage of material to choose from when deciding to take a dive into the world of *Kino's Journey*, and unfortunately, the 2017 anime does not make the best case for itself as a starting point, as a sequel, a reboot, or as really, much of anything.\n\nLet it be said though, that it cannot be accused of lacking love for its source material. In addition to the fanbait trivium that is the fact that Kino is here voiced by Aoi Yuuki--the very same VA who voiced Sakura in the closing episode of the original series--and that the stories to be adapted were (apparently, hard information on this is surprisingly difficult to find) chosen via fan-poll, it goes to great lengths to try to *seem Kino-y*, sometimes to a fault. While it could never capture the visual charm of the original adaptation--a scratchy, muted look that most modern anime don't really try to pull off (though the contemporary *Girls' Last Tour* by sheer coincidence managed to rather well)--standards have after all changed, it *does* often try to recapture the spirit of the original and in three instances straight up remakes three episodes from the 2003 anime. This makes it all the more frustrating when it fumbles the ball.\n\n\"Land/Country of Adults\" is arguably the only episode *improved* in the reboot, certainly at least up to par, the more grim lighting (closer to the 2003 show's palette) and various changes (such as Young Kino's \"school\" being more like some kind of gothic church) nicely playing up the cultlike nature of the country. A lack of subtlety actually serves it well here, making Young Kino's parents and entire society seem all the more psychotic with cramped camera angles and shouted, blunt voice acting. In particular, a sequence near the end of the episode where Young Kino pulls away on Hermes for the first time and rushes through the city gates to escape, and the entire world suddenly explodes into bright colors as Kino sees the natural beauty of the world outside her country for the first time, you get a real taste for what this reboot really could and should have been throughout. *Kino's Journey* refined and distilled. It's also an interesting juxtaposition with the previous episode, \"A Kind Land\". In the 2003 anime the two were quite far apart (\"Land of Adults\" was only the fourth episode in the '03 anime, and \"A Kind Land\" was the *last*), but here they form interesting counterpoints. Kino attaining the same freedom that young Sakura would later be denied (it's also vaguely implied that Kino's original name may have *also been* Sakura, which is interesting certainly).\n\nSadly, the rest of the episodes aren't quite up to this bar. Very few are outright bad (aside from the clipped retelling of \"Colosseum\" that omits most of the changes made in the 03 adaptation for a story that is shorter but certainly not more impactful) but for the most part they stick to one of two formulas. Either, Kino enters a country, is faced with some moral quandary, and handles it--or doesn't--in her own Kino-y way (almost always in a way that leaves the question of who was right up to the viewers to decide the answer to, the only episode that actually takes any kind of stance itself is \"Land of Adults\"), *or,* the episode doesn't focus on Kino at all. The latter in particular are hit-or-miss, and it sometimes feels like *Kino's Journey* doesn't quite know what to do with its title character. The b-side adventures of the swordsman Shizu and his talking dog (and, later, a soft-spoken girl they pick up who has sociopathic tendencies and a fondness for grenades) are entertaining enough, but they seem a bit out of step with the rest of the show, and since combined with other episodes that focus on non-Kino characters, they take up almost half the episodes, it gives *Kino* a bit of an identity crisis, even as two of those very episodes (\"In The Clouds\", about a slave girl who somewhat inadvertently breaks free of her chains, and \"Historic Country\", about Kino's mentor)--consecutive ones it must be mentioned--are two of the series' most interesting episodes.\n\nAll in all it's rather hard to decipher who, exactly, this particular telling of Kino's adventures is aimed at. It's far from bad--certainly not the trainwreck some fans of the 2003 adaptation have claimed it to be--but it certainly doesn't reach the impact of that series, and really it barely stands on its own at all, seemingly most suited to being a sort of visual companion for the books, which western fans are unlikely to own. At the same time, it's hard to recommend anyone to watch the 2003 anime and *then* this, since doing so is likely to spoil them on this series' lesser but certainly extant merits, and the other way around is likely to leave viewers confused (witness any number of Crunchyroll commenters cooking up convoluted fan-theories beneath any given episode on that website to explain what seem like plotholes. Though really for the aforementioned reasons it's a bit hard to blame them). Combined with other more minor quibbles; the often distracting CGI (which has no excuse to be so lazy, given that it aired alongside *Girls' Last Tour* and *Houseki no Kuni*, both of which made great use of CGI in very different ways), the somewhat generic soundtrack, and Crunchyroll's sometimes choppy and occasionally outright bad subtitling (blatant typos are not a good look on any show), this rounds up to a show that while certainly having merits, is kind of hard to recommend to much of anyone. Certainly, *Kino* diehards--those who don't hate it for not being *Kino 2003* at any rate--will find *something* to like here, and it does open the doors for more *Kino* in the future, which is hardly a bad thing (and the ending of the final episode, the supremely bizarre \"Fields of Sheep\", does nod toward that fact. With a long shot of Kino and Hermes relaxing as the two discuss journeys ending), but on its own it's a rather confused series. With tighter direction, more focus, and less CGI, it could've been great, as it is, it's something that can only be recommended with a lot of caveats, which is a serious shame, Kino deserves better."}, {"id": 2348, "score": 65, "body": "Following the trend of Fate adaptations comes Fate/Apocrypha, an anime based on a light novel based on a scrapped concept for an online game (a niche which was ultimately filled by Fate/Grand Order).\n\nApocrypha provides a different take on the \"Holy Grail War\" format of previous entries in the series by depicting an all-out war between two teams with seven magic-using \"Masters\" each partnered with a \"Servant\" based on a historical (or mythological, or literary) figure. \n\nFate/Stay Night--the initial entry in the series--as well as its prequel Fate/Zero deal with half the number of characters in a battle-royale format and both do an excellent job at developing their characters, themes, and general narrative.

A-1 Pictures is far from a bad studio, but the animation quality is rather inconsistent with sudden dips and peaks at various points.

Yeah, *Gleipnir* is one of those. Manga like this, those of the oft-ridiculed tits-n-gore genre, tend to be the target of derision for a reason, there's really not much to these beyond taking some combination of stale shonen tropes, adding more bare breasts and the occasional character death (or fakeouts thereof) to sharpen the edges, season with some whacked-out character designs and call it a day.\n\nDo I sound negative? It's not entirely fair, *Gleipnir* is not notably bad for its genre and in fact I'd go farther, it isn't bad at all, it's just not particularly *good* either, and it certainly has its share of problems. Our protagonists (they each pull about half of the narrative weight) are Shuichi, a dark-haired coward with the ability to turn into a fursuit with super strength--really--and Claire, a half-white sort-of femme fatale who spends a majority of the manga's runtime in various states of undress. The two meet when Shuichi saves an unconscious Claire from a burning building, and immediately has to restrain himself from sexually assaulting her unconscious body. There is of course the \"oh, he's not *really in full control of his actions\"* angle, but even if we buy that it's hard for this to not immediately sour one's opinion of Shuichi. Claire later blackmails him into helping her find her missing sister using this fact, these are not the best of people.\n\nBut here's the thing, if the manga were *merely* extremely dark and its characters amoral, there would not really be a problem. This is how *Murcielago*, a much better action seinen with a very dark tone, manages to tiptoe around having to give its characters real motivations or moral codes--if everyone is a horrid douchebag all the time, you don't ever expect anything else and the story is free to focus on other things. *Gleipnir*'s problem is that it cannot decide if it wants to do that, or if it wants to be a 'dark shonen'-esque story with actual emotional stakes, so the result is that it ends up yo-yoing between the two, often at inopportune moments.\n\nShuichi and Claire discover that Claire can actually *enter* Shuichi while he is in his super-strong fursuit mode, and the two essentially combine in this way to tackle the first threat they encounter--another superpowered human. This would be a great setup, and in fact the fight itself actually *is* very compelling. Shuichi retreats and mentally curls up into a ball while Claire takes over the actual function of fighting, when she shoots their attacker, he's distraught and she's gleeful--there is an actual conflict here. Then Claire decides to joke that she soiled herself while inside Shuichi. This is the flow of the manga, genuinely interesting action-oriented or emotional scene followed by a stupid, crass thing that seems to have been xeroxed from some other property. It's jarring, and more damningly, it's *predictable*. When a lesbian is introduced to the cast later on, she is *of course* predatory and tries to rape Claire. When a cute cat girl is introduced, there *of course* is a bit where we're shown her dying horribly by being crushed (she recovers, but this is not the point). Imagine a dark shonen manga that was, at the end of every important development or interesting scene, handed off for a few pages to a 14 year old child, and you have adequately summed up the problems with *Gleipnir*.\n\nWhat's most frustrating is that the manga's actual ***premise*** is interesting! Superpower stories are nothing new of course--certainly not to seinen--but their origin here, by way of alien coins which need to be collected for the benefit of a mysterious extraterrestrial benefactor, who makes use of what is best described as a magic vending machine to create these powers, is intriguing enough. Combine that with snappy dialogue, a cast that expands comfortably instead of ballooning right away, and a small web of connected central mysteries, and you have something that really could have been something special. That *Gleipnir* fumbles the ball so often, and in ways that are so predictable, is irritating.\n\nTo put it straight, because of this, it is rather hard to recommend *Gleipnir* to anyone except those numb enough to these flaws common to the genre (*Gleipnir* is by no means the only manga to have them, and certainly it is not the worst) to not care, which is deeply, deeply annoying, because with a few tweaks it could be so much better. \n\nFinally, there is a technical problem to mention--one that is outside the manga's fault, but still annoying nonetheless. Currently the easiest way to read *Gleipnir* in the west is via manga aggregator sites. Unfortunately, the skilled Psylocke Scans seem to have dropped the series, and currently chapters are being machine translated (apparently from the Spanish translation, into English) by a person or group calling themselves Kirishima Fansubs.

It was kind of rushed.\nThe story kind of grabbed me around episode 6 and I really wanted to find out if Alice and Oz would find the thruth, so it was disappointing to me that it was kind of an open ending which was basically screaming for a sequel.\n\nI love the story of Alice in Wonderland and at first, that's why I started watching this anime. I like that a lot of characters from the book like the Mad Hatter were incorporated into the storyline of this anime. But I also feel like they could have done more with the storyline.\n\nI think I might have to read the manga, seeing that that is also finished publishing.

However, when Oz's coming-of-age ceremony is interrupted by the malicious Baskerville Clan intent on banishing him into the depths of the Abyss, the Vessalius heir realizes that his peaceful life of luxury is at its end. Now, he must confront the world of the Abyss and its dwellers, the monstrous \"Chains,\" which are both not quite as fake as he once believed.\n\nBased on the supernatural fantasy manga of the same name, Pandora Hearts tells the story of fifteen-year-old Oz's journey to discover the meaning behind the strange events that have overtaken his life.

However nothing like this is shown, mentioned or event hinted to in the actual anime. The two girls are literally wandering aimlessly through modern Japan without a clear intention in mind. So it seems that they are not travelling for a specific purpose (namely that of \"saving\" or making their world a better place) and that is very confusing: I couldn't figure out if the OVA was actually failing to tell me something or if it's intention was that of not telling me anything.

The girls are cute, the situations are heart-warming and kinda of melancholic. I will with great pleasure spend hours watching Chron fooling around. The music is very good, as it's indeed one of the main points of the anime, particularly the ED. The two episodes' subplots are nothing special nor inventive but they are at least well realized. The characters aren't that special: we have a joyful hyperactive Chron and a more mature and thoughtful Escha; a pretty standard pair of personalities we're by now accustomed to. However I must say that I never thought something on the lines of \"come on, I've saw this a million times before\" for the whole show and so I think that the characters did indeed a very good job.\n\n~~~img720(https://www.animeclick.it/immagini/anime/Escha_Chron/gallery_original/Escha_Chron-595e0c9a8c344.jpg)~~~\n\nGiven the problems above I would not recommend this OVA to everyone.

Thank you.\n---\n<br>\n # ~~~__Synopsis__~~~#\n<br>\n~~~Jiang Xiaobai is an editor for a weekly magazine, but one day he remembers an old childhood friend he used to know and then suddenly meets someone who used to look just like her.  The only problem is that Jiang Xiaobai has forgotten most of his memories and can't remember exactly what happened in his past to make him forget about her...\n~~~ \n<br>\n# ~~~__Story and Characters__~~~#\n<br>\n~~~ This story is about a man called Jiang Xiaobai who has amnesia and doesn't remember much about his past. His co-worker who is helping to work on a project together is Tong Li, a young woman who resembles Jiang Xiaobai's long-lost friend from childhood.\nWith each episode you learn about both of their pasts and the connection they had when they were young. This is told through using flashbacks which gives an good amount of detail also to other characters. \n\nJiang Xiaobai is your typical character with amnesia and he suffers from headaches which help him to remember parts of his past. The main female character Tong Li who is much more complex as she is the one who makes this anime what it is. Her story is awkward to explain without spoiling the story but she knows Jiang Xiaobai for who he was in the past and she fears he has forgotten about her. \n\nThe only other side characters to note is Xiyu and Xiao Li; Xiyu is Xiaobai's childhood friend from Xiaobai's past. She is the girl who greatly resembles Tong Li and I cannot say anymore than that without spoilers. Xiao Yi is a really shy girl who has a crush on Jiang Xiaobai but cannot tell him how she feels for him. The other characters are from Xiaobai's past who formed a band together at school. \n\n\n<br>\n# ~~~__Art and Animation__~~~#\n<br>\n~~~ The animation is a bit difficult to explain... Let me say first this anime has CGI artwork but that is not a bad thing. I know a lot of people are not fond of CGI in anime (_myself included_) but it's not as bad as what you think. This is one of the better CGI you can watch as it's been made with a lot of care and attention to detail. Only the lip-sync is way off...\nHowever the reason why the characters move so fluidly is because of Motion Capture. Whether or not you think this is lazy or innovative is up to you.  \n\nMeanwhile the artwork is vibrant, especially when you get a good look at the city skyline from a distance. \n\n\n~~~\n<br>\n# ~~~__Sound, Music and Voice Acting__~~~#\n<br>\n~~~ The first thing I will say is that the opening song \"Bu Xiang Bing/\u00e4\u00b8\u008d\u00e6\u0083\u00b3\u00e7\u0097\u0085\" by \"Er Hu Sheng\" is absolutely brilliant, so much that I never skipped the song. Definitely a favourite of mine because it also fits some of the more emotional scenes later on in this anime so well, but I won't say what those scenes are about. Why do I like the song so much? Well keep the song in your mind and you will understand what I mean...\n\nThe ending song is called \"Yunyan Cheng Yu/\u00e4\u00ba\u0091\u00e7\u0083\u009f\u00e6\u0088\u0090\u00e9\u009b\u00a8\" by \"Fangdong De Mao\" and in my opinion is calm but melancholic, yet at the same time puts a smile on my face. However this song becomes really sad once you begin to understand the events in this anime.\n\nThe insert songs you will hear throughout this anime are timed well so you feel the emotions during key scenes and it breathes more life into the story. I really commend the use of these songs and there is a lot of varity too, some are relaxing ballads while some are more upbeat or dramatic songs. There is also the band song called \"Fly\" which you will know when you hear it. Still, you start to think this is a musical anime with so many insert songs..\n\nEnough about music, let's talk about voice acting. The voices are in Mandarin and they are not bad. Each voice suits the characters and doesn't sound annoying in any way. There is no Japanese version or English dub for this anime as of writing this review so you have no choice with languages.\n\nSounds are fine, I didn't really notice anything extraordinary since this is a romance anime.~~~\n  \n<br>\n~~~\nyoutube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq3oxEiw9a8)~~~\n# ~~~__Final Thoughts__~~~#\n<br>\n~~~ A surprisingly interesting  seinen/romance anime that rivals Quanzhi Gaoshou/The King's Avatar for \"Best Chinese Anime\", but the 3D art might be too weird for some.\nThe OVA is not the ending to the series! But it does give you a hint as to what happened.~~~\n\n~~~Thank you for reading my review! If you see any mistakes then please let me know. I would greatly appreciate any advice you can give me.~~~"}, {"id": 2433, "score": 50, "body": "There's a sting of bitter irony in the fact that *Re:Creators*, an anime about anime, will probably end up being defined by its meta-narrative in the long run. The show itself was in possession of an interesting premise, a knack for visual flair (sometimes sadly disrupted by cheap CGI), and a tendency for better and worse to pile odd plot kinks on top of each other, leading up to a conclusion that has been alternately praised for its unusual direction, and denigrated for allowing the main villain to essentially get away with everything. \n\nIn spite of the mixed reception, though. *Re:Creators* had an admirable amount of ambition, characters who often managed to step outside the logical bounds of being direct xeroxes of well-worn cliches, and a really damn cool villain. Despite, or maybe because of, its ambition so vastly outstripping what it could reasonably *do,* there was a real charm to watching the series work itself into knots, and even just in watching the cast interact. So it's not particularly surprising that it did enough numbers to get a manga adaptation, and that that adaptation had a spinoff. What *is* surprising however, and what is probably most damning about *Re:Creators One More*, is that it possesses exactly zero of that charm.\n\nMaybe it's a bit overly blunt to lead with that, but it's the honest truth. There's nothing *wrong* with *One More* per se, it's not horribly written, the art is good and nicely expressive (although its resemblance to the series' art is pretty thin), but there's a major problem in the fact that it takes place during the exact same time frame as the show, and as such, it writes around the series' plot and attempts, on that, to awkwardly graft the non-story of hardcore otaku Miharu. Miharu is not the most interesting protagonist. There have definitely been worse, but \"otaku girl\" is not anything super new, and a good chunk of her characterization is her devotion to her fictional \"husband\", Sho (who did indeed appear in the later episodes of the main series), and her quest to meet and marry him. She has a daki, that sort of thing. Occasionally, she will humorously misinterpret an event from the main series. For instance, attributing the sudden appearance of a new design for Selestia as the author's \"burning passion\" overflowing and causing her to manifest in the real world. She also has the slightest bit of extra depth in that she's an amateur mangaka herself, and is apparently rather insecure about her work (whether this is a subtle bit of self-insertion by mangaka Yuuki Kumagai is left as an exercise to the reader). Miharu is far from unlikable--in fact in terms of immediate likeability she's probably doing better than main series protagonist and famously vanilla individual Souta, but she's just not that *interesting*. \n\nimg220(https://i.imgur.com/QLnyaQO.png)\n######*Protagonist Miharu is certainly cute, but, well, not much else.*\n---\n\nPart of the original *Re:Creators*' strength is that the Creations (inexplicably the term \"manifested character\" is used here instead) felt like anime characters, and the Creators felt more like real people. Comparatively down to earth and subtle. Miharu seems more like an escapee from one of any number of slice of life comedies than an actual person herself, and the same is true of her two classmates that comprise the rest of the \"real person\" cast, and this really is the manga's main writing flaw. Miharu treats everything like a game (partly due to not having the context of the main series that we on the other side of the fourth wall do) and part of her quest to meet Sho. There's no real stakes here, just a girl and two of her friends kind of shuffling around behind the scenes of *Re:Creators* and saying and doing goofy things.\n\nimg220(https://i.imgur.com/5XfrHnv.png)\n\nimg220(https://i.imgur.com/W7QbiSr.png)\n######*Yes, the manga does feature* both *of these old-as-sand gags in its meager six chapters.*\n---\n\nFunnily enough, the character that actually steals the show is main series transplant Mirokuji, who essentially tells Miharu off for treating their suddenly very real struggle as a means to meet her huzbando. When she finally *does* meet Sho in the manga's penultimate chapter, he's weirded out, and after gushing to him for some indeterminate amount of time, Miharu has her phone shot to pieces by Blitz Talker in what is undeniably among the funniest scenes in the manga. \n\nThe manga's final chapter is devoted to Miharu (now in an understandable funk from being blown off by her favorite fictional character) and her friend attending the Elimination Festival. What this means in practice is that we're treated to a cliff's notes of the actual events from the main series, intercut with visually well-done but plotwise meaningless shots of Miharu enjoying herself. Afterward, a still-bummed Miharu is cheered up further by reconciling with Shou and Mirokuji. She laments (before being cheered up. Again) that she's \"merely an observer\" and \"not the main character, not the heroine\". The tragic irony here is that she's actually *right.* In spite of what's presumably supposed to be an empowering finale, Miharu really *isn't* the main character. Because this isn't her story, it's *Re:Creators*' story, which she has been awkwardly written into the sidelines of.\n\nGiven her own series, and more than six chapters to develop as a character, Miharu could probably actually be a decently interesting protagonist (the series' funniest joke is its very last, where she draws a doujinshi *of herself and Sho*, it is absolutely the sort of thing that an obsessive fangirl sort would do, and it's much more original than the billionth \"look at all her merchandise!\" joke). But here, scribbled in the margins of a story that's not her own, she doesn't have that room, and there's something again kind of bitterly ironic about that. Even the most clich\u00c3\u00a9 of characters deserve better.\n\nimg220(https://i.imgur.com/mMjZ5Ql.png)\n######*In addition to the occasional more clever gag, it's really Kumagai's command of art, especially facial expressions, that are redeeming factors here*\n---\n\nIf there's a silver lining to be extracted, it's that Kumagai can *certainly* draw, and this is probably not her last rodeo in the medium (she had an ongoing serial even before starting work on this series). It's hard to believe that there are not brighter horizons ahead for the talented young artist, and maybe in those stories--that have yet to be written--a sort of retroactive place for the character of Miharu can be found, as a symbol of potential yet-unrealized. And really, what is *Re:Creators* about if not taking control of the narrative?"}, {"id": 2447, "score": 60, "body": "I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m an avid fan MMORPGS. I grew up playing them, non stop in the confines of my own room so this Overlord was a joy and a breeze to watch. I finished this anime in a couple days. \n\nThe story centers on Momonga, an unidentified Japanese man lingering on the servers of the soon dead Dive Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game or (DMMORPG), Yggdrasil. The game is known for its unusual freedom given to the players making it the most popular game in Japan. Our Main MC, Momonga is reminiscing about the great times he has had playing the game for some unknown reason is being shut down. It is never explained why the game was coming to an end but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll leave it to later seasons to explain why this was the case. The catch is when the servers finally shut down Momonga finds himself stuck in the world that was once Yggdrasil. He has no idea why this occurred yet he is thrust into a chaotic world as the ruler of a despotic kingdom surrounded by inhuman servants that serve as Guardians to the Tomb of Nazarick. His goal is to reach potential allies who might also be stuck in this fearsome world and to do that he plans to spread his name across the lands. A badass premise, eh? \n\nI was reluctant to get into this anime since most anime about being stuck in a game are kinda shit. (SAO, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m talking to you.) I was pleasantly surprised to find that this anime was unique and interesting. No harems, no overpowered characters without justification, and no bullshit! The MC is indeed overpowered but not without reason. It is shown that he was level 100, most likely a cap level for the game, therefore, it is perfectly reasonable to suggest he is god tier in terms of abilities. It was nice to see that Momonga is a spell caster when they could have easily shot for a warrior even though is very capable of playing the role. Momonga now taking on the role of Ains Ooal Gown is my favorite part of the entire series. He stands out because he is what I always wanted in an MC who is thrusted in a video game world. Confident, intelligent, a complete badass but a dork at heart because at the end of all this he is still a nerd playing a video game rather than being social so basically me. Time and time again he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shown his prowess in a way that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t overbearing. My gripes come with the other characters. \n\nThere are only a select few of Guardians that I care for and it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Shalltear. Cocytus and Albedo are ones that stood out for me. The condescension towards the humans was a constant annoyance. Albedo and Nabe were constant edgelords that would not shut up about humans being shite. We get it, Ains Sama is the epitome of greatness. Let us move on. I found the Guardians loyalty not to be endearing but sheep flocking to a wolf. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why I found it laughable that the Guardians look down on humans so much. But perhaps that flaw is what \u00e2\u0080\u009chumanizes\u00e2\u0080\u009d them in the end. If that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what they were going for, so be it. It was just too annoying for me. I appreciate the inhuman servants being different from one another difference in personalities and abilities. It gave life to the cast even though I had some minor problems. Overall they were alright. Oh, thanks for the loli elves. I very much appreciate it. \n\nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have much to say about the world building since it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty simple so far. Where the worldbuilding shines is when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s compared to the likeness of what it once was, an MMORPG. The animation was great because of how it was executed the CGI never really affected me too much. However, the final fight scene when it came to magic buffs felt a bit dragged even though it was necessary. \n.\n6/10.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this.

However I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get around to watch it for quite a while, I finished it about 30 minutes before writing this review actually.\nSo what are my thoughts on it? Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start the review.\n\n__- S T O R Y -__\nDespite the extremely thrilling premise that just yells ''GRANDIOSE ADVENTURE'', you really don't get any of that.\nThe characters barely go through anything yet progress so much due to the extremely fast pacing. The series is extremely telegraphed in that aspect, as you always know when Reg and Riko face a big danger and manage to overcome it, they're practically at the end of the layer and will dive even further only for the same ''Explore a bit, get into a hopeless situation, prevail'' cycle to repeat.\n Practically the whole series' plot can be summed up to the same length of the previous paragraph.\n\nThe series does introduce a villain by the end of the season as a set up towards the announced sequel but he is nothing but a textbook bad guy, since nothing screams evil more than ''Booo gruesome experiments on children''.\n\nDespite this, the series have a lot of emotion in them alongside an extremely well constructed world with a lot of potential for further development.\n\n__- C H A R A C T E R S -__\nMade in Abyss is full of visually distinct and memorable characters but a lot of them are extremely simple as personalities.\nThey have no depth or any inner conflicts, what you see is what you get. What the characters say, that's what they think, what they say, they feel, there's never a moment of subtlety or expressiveness without mentioning what they're expressing with words outside of a major moment in the final episode.\nAll of them have valid motives for what they're doing, be it sense of exploration accompanied with wanting to meet your mother who's waiting at the bottom of the Abyss or wanting to find out who you are. The motives don't feel weak but sometimes the conviction of the characters' does and unintentionally so.\n\n__- A R T  &  A N I M A T I O N -__\nThe art is absolutely gorgeous, no other way around it. It's extremely detailed and atmospheric. The world couldn't have been portrayed better. The animation is good enough, although the quality jumps a lot.\nIt's usually above average with plenty of double framing and that works, but out of nowhere it can get real smooth and dynamic when an action scene comes. Which wouldn't have been so haphazard... if... the smooth animation didn't occasionally show up out of nowhere on some completely arbitrary moments. It's kind of evident whenever a better key animator's turn comes around to animate a portion of the episode.\n\nThat's a minor nitpick though. The smooth animation is welcome.\nIt compliments the show's world as a whole and could be really expressive given it's quality if the characters just let it do it's own work instead of yelling out their emotions constantly.\n\n__- S O U N D T R A C K -__\nThe OST is fantastic, it's extremely memorable and almost always played at the right moment to play with your feelings. The whole track list has that sense of mystery, beauty, sadness and adventure at the same time so almost every piece of the score can be used at any given moment and it'd fit perfectly.\nThe compositions are mostly made of orchestral arrangements and medleys with touching vocals.\nI do feel like the track ''Hanazeve Caradhina'' was played a bit too much (4 times in total) for what it was.\nIt's the most special track in the whole OST so it should've been handled with a bit more care as it's amazing.\n\n__- O V E R A L L -__\nI think Made in Abyss is a really good show overall with plenty of positives but is stopped from being the grandiose adventure it's supposed to be due to it's extremely quick pacing and lack of exploration. The characters sometimes feel like they literally fly past the Abyss' layers.\nIt's definitely worth a watch though. When Season 2 comes around I'll definitely watch it."}, {"id": 2508, "score": 60, "body": "I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t blame you for overlooking Etotama. At first glance, it looks like a generic moe-blob show with a twist in that all the girls are animal spirits. In truth, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do anything too impressive, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d still say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great timewaster, and a solid all around comedy!\n\nThe story of Etotama is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Weird. Written at the last minute, aka. rushed/insignificant kind of weird\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Our main character *insert generic ecchi protagonist here* just bought a new apartment, and in said apartment, female animal spirits spawn from a hole in the floor of his living room (don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t question it). Said animal spirits include, but not limited to; the animals of the chinese zodiac. You can usually expect an episode to go as following; Shenanigans, conflict, badass fighting scene, victory pose, end. It is nothing really to write home about. All for pure enjoyment. Its very much a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo not think too much about it\u00e2\u0080\u009d kind of anime. That being said, the show does like to do a complete 180\u00c2\u00b0, by having a character stabbed through the head with a sword, and ultimately dying! In an ecchi mahou shoujo anime\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yeah\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\nCharacters : As mentioned before, the main cast consists of Takeru Amato, whom is *Insert generic ecchi protagonist traits here*, and a plethera of female animal spirits whom either has a speech impediment related to their race, or abuse the top notch comedy known as punology. For example, there is a cat character introduced in the first episode whom ends every sentence with nyan (japanese perception of the sound a cat would make). There is a saying that a rooster looses its memory after walking three steps, and of course there is a girl spirit thingy whom looses her memory every third step, though not as obnoxious as she could have turned out, gladly. I figured the main antagonist would be a bee-spirit, since fuck bees, but I digress.\n\nAlso, the animal spirits possess superpowers fueled by others happiness. After having experienced the euphoria of uttering a god deed, the animal spirits, after a transformation sequence, turn into cgi chibi characters in a fighting game along the lines of Tekken, on a tv that magically appears on the spot. (As i said earlier, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think too much about it). So in a nutshell, the show is a magical girl anime on acid, or should i rather say; magical chinese zodiac girl anime. As for characterisation, there were quite too many characters for the show to go through each and every one, but you do get the general idea of them quickly, due to everyone being buildt of a stereotype of an animal, which also made it quite entertaining. With this being a comedy, the characterisation does not need to be perfect, as long as the interaction is on point, which for the most part, it is! You could say a lot about the characters themselves, but the fact stands that most of them are just tropes to get the story progressing.\n\nThe art and animation of Etotama is a weird case. On one end, it is \u00e2\u0080\u009cshortcuts, the animation\u00e2\u0080\u009d, in the sense that there are still frames, repeated sequences and other lazy shortcuts everywhere. On the other hand, the actual cgi fights themselves look fantastic! Cgi done well in an anime! The cgi art-style is done in such a way that it looks quite a bit like it is drawn, which is weird\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 You\u00e2\u0080\u0099l get were I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going with this, as the entire anime is presented to us within the first few episodes. The rest is mostly rinse and repeat with a few twists and turns here and there for good measure.\n\nIn the musics department, there is absolutely nothing to talk about. Abso-fucking-lutely nothing. The opening is a typical \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is going to be stuck in my head for the shows runtime, then become forgotten for good\u00e2\u0080\u009d. You know, a typical ecchi opening -> DxD, Love-Ru, HotD, SAO, etc.. Songs that will ultimately be forgotten, however unfortunate. As for the actual soundtrack itself, it is the epitome of mediocrity. Neither good, nor unfitting. Just mediocre supporting tracks.\n\nUltimately, what is the appeal of the show? Jokes, puns, shenanigans, pop cult references, and the utter destruction of the 4th wall. This is by all means a \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is bad and I know it is bad\u00e2\u0080\u009d kind of anime, but I still can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It is simply very enjoyable. Thank god this anime does not\ntry to take itself seriously. What makes it bearable, is how it acknowledges it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own stupidity. With the exception of fan-service and comedy, there are no redeeming factors whatshowever. If you look for an actually good anime (plot-, character-, animation- and sound-wise), then I advise you to\nstay as far away from this as possible, unless you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re of course looking for a change of pace. If you on the other hand if you want to sit back and enjoy 12 episodes of absolute bullshit, then go ahead! Etotama is dumb entertainment at its finest, which has me giving it a 3/5, which is a great\nscore for your run of the mill \u00e2\u0080\u009c12ep one of ecchi\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}, {"id": 2517, "score": 60, "body": "~~~__The Currency of Indifference__ ~~~\n\nWhen watching this show I ponder on what it really means to \u00e2\u0080\u009cFalling into the Hype\u00e2\u0080\u009d.It is naive to think that when a show is popular that it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t affect your mood going in. But on that same thought is there a difference in \u00e2\u0080\u009cFalling into the Hype\u00e2\u0080\u009d and just seeking understatement on why something is popular. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come into this show hyped but throughout this experience I was always search for that special something. Something I never found. All I was left was this indifferent feeling. When you are stuck in an indifferent feeling is a good indication that the show is average. It is tasked upon you at that point to go through all the aspects of the show and see what would you say is above average and if that is enough to warrant putting up the score. \n\nWhen I asked about this show before I started watching my comrades noted there was a lot of mentioning of economics.That is definitely something that caught my attention and was the most enjoyable plot about the show.I actually wrote a paper in college all about merchant guilds and having an anime that covered it was satisfying but only to a certain extent. We saw glimpses of the trade warfare going on but it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a full-fledged dive into the economic wars of the world. I would personally like to see a show about merchant guilds that would operate more like 91 Days or Koei's The Romance of the Three Kingdoms. There was no individuality given to any of the guilds. \n\nThe merchant guilds were primarily there to only put hardships on our main character Lawrence. A character that I have to say am disappointed in as he was fairly bland the entire entry. There were glimpses at the end that showed he could improve in the second season. But he needs to drop the White Knight act. Then even as a businessman I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t respect him as I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know who in their right mind would put all their money in one basket instead of building up a contingency. There is no time in this show where I can definitively say I felt bad for him.\n\nWhen Holo calls this guy a loser. She isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wrong. Holo is the best character of the show by default but still isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly my type of girl.I have seen a lot of individuals deeming Lawrence and Holo to be one of the best couples in all of anime.Yet the romance in this season has barely even been scratched. I would hope in the second season there would be much improvement. In the first season it has we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve only seen Tsundere flirting. That is nowhere near enough for me. \n\nThen we move on the supernatural element of the show. I really liked the opening of the show and the world it was attempting to create in episode 1 about Holo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s origins.But all of that was downgraded to a side story and an unfulfilling one at that. There was all this talk about the people believing they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need Holo anymore to bless their crops. But because of everything else going on in the show the climax to that just fell flat. I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even put that into the importance of the currency wars that was noted throughout the season. Having rivaling currencies was very intriguing aspect to follow.But when the economics changed over to just being there for hardships on Lawrence we lost that flare there as well. \n\nEven when I attempt to think of something satisfying I'm coming up with a blank. The OP and ED are good but nothing I would put in my top 20. The Art is good but nothing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rave about. Maybe 3 or 4 points given for that. I will also note that I felt the pacing was rushed for the plot. There was also time for more plot that was taken up by slice of life episodes. Finally I do find it ironic that even in the moment of writing this review. My feeling on this review of the show reflects my opinions of show. Indifferent. So I feel like a base 60 out of 100 is the right way to go. Spice and Wolf is neither a bear or bull market. "}, {"id": 2522, "score": 60, "body": "Ito Junji: Collection, despite what the average score might lead you to believe is actually decent. Based on the collection of manga of the same name, these stories depict various abnormal occurrences and happenings. From what I know, there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a pattern as to which stories were picked.\n\nIto Junji surprised me in many ways, one of those being the creepy atmosphere. Many of the stories are quite unnerving at times, especially with how crude the artstyle is. The fact that the overall art looks quite bad, as in the character models aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anything special and the backgrounds are rather cheap-looking only adds to the tone, which is fitting for a show like this.\nOne good thing I can say about the characters, or rather, character in this case, is that our main protagonist, Souichi, is a nice addition to these stories. His peculiar and bizarre nature makes everything just a little bit creepier, especially with how he behaves around others. Whenever he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on screen he does something weird or funny, and it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be the same without him.\n\nEven though Ito Junji is a horror anime, it has a surprising amount of outright hilarious moments, like the whole circus story. The way everything played out felt like an unintentional comedy of sorts, although it worked in this case since it was genuinely funny and not just ironically funny like some \u00e2\u0080\u009cso bad it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good\u00e2\u0080\u009d shows which don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try to be funny but end up actually being funny.\n\nAll in all, I quite liked Ito Junji: Collection, and I plan on checking out the manga in the future.\n"}, {"id": 2534, "score": 57, "body": "#__Disclaimer__\n__SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS__\nI can't write reviews, this text will just include my random thoughts about this show. Also, I've started watching it back when it first aired, stopped and finished just yesterday so my view on this title may be a bit off.\n~~~You were warned.~~~\n\n#Obvious Problems\nNet-juu no Susume is a show about a NEET woman who literally quit her job just to play MMO games. Fair enough, we've seen this in anime already. But there's one issue. Where does she take money from? Maybe it was explained and I missed it but to me, it seems like she shouldn't have internet access, water, food, ANYTHING. And that's partly where my *review's* summary is coming from - she's more like a teenager whose parents are sending them money to live and study but they quit the school because who cares about a job or education when you can play games while you get money for doing nothing.\nBut there's another smaller issue which, to be fair, triggered me even more which is at times the characters were even more annoying than your teen drama romcom cast. How is it possible? I have no idea but they're supposed to be reasonable, mature adults and somehow they're more childish and dense than freakin' middle-schoolers.\nI honestly wouldn't have any problems if Moriko and Yuuta were, say, 10 years older. But honestly, can you imagine 30-year-old acting like that? Well, I can't.\n\n#But this anime has to do *something* right, right?\nYes, yes it does. Actually, if you turn a blind eye to my nitpicking it's pretty decent show. Soundtrack was pretty nice, character design was appealing and animation was good. Besides characters' unexplained behavior they actually progress - that's something I wasn't expecting from a show which served me otaku romcom with 15-year-old in two times older body. Their relationships feel pretty natural and development is believable - again, something I'm never expecting from a romcom.\nBut that's about it - strong basis, but nothing more.\n\n#So then, why such low score?\nIf the plot was only as predictable as it was I wouldn't complain but oh man those coincidences are seriously something else. They are playing *presumably* large (or at least somewhat big) MMO game and not only they live in the same city but __they all also live near eachother__?! That's seriously some [r/nevertellmetheodds](https://www.reddit.com/r/nevertellmetheodds/) material. Not only that but also Yuuta turns out to be __the same person__ Moriko was playing with years ago. NOT ONLY THAT but Yuuta also __hires at the same place__ Moriko dropped out from. And the list of __coincidences__ goes on. I apologize but if the plot can't think of any reason for any action, I can't score this show any higher, despite how cute, enjoyable or whatever it was.\n\n#But hey, both OP and ED rule"}, {"id": 2535, "score": 60, "body": "(This review was originally written for MyAnimeList on March 28, 2018)\n\nOsomatsu-san's second season is not offensively bad or even bad at all: I can't say it didn't manage to entertain whenever I sat down to watch it every monday. But with every new episode, it felt like something was lacking, like something from season one was lost.\n\nTo start with, the move from two or more \"sketches\" per episode to episode-length sketches feels like a misstep. With season one, sketches never became too tedious (outside of fan-least-favorites like F6) because of the fact that they were not the length of the entire episode. When a sketch ended, it felt like it was because the premise has been exhausted and the show can now move on to something else.\n\nBy having entire episodes dedicated to one sketch, some flaws that were in the writing previously become much more evident, and things become a lot more tedious. It wasn't until season 2 that I realized that whenever a joke was made about one Matsuno, a similar joke had to be made about every other brother before the show could move on. If this happened before season 2, it only became obvious now, and if I didn't think a joke was funny once, it certainly wouldn't become funny after hearing it five more times.\n\nEven episodes with more than one sketch had a similar feeling of tediousness, that the joke was simply going on way longer than it needed to go. The sketch involving Choromatsu and Ichimatsu had a promising premise, but at some point the one joke of the sketch, that they are uncomfortable being alone around each other, was just being repeated over and over again by the end. Maybe this aspect of the show has always been here, but if that's the case then it only got worst.\n\nAnother complaint I have is that the show at times feels like it is resting on its laurels when it comes to episode scenarios compared to season one. It often relies on interaction between the brothers to be enough for a sketch, when season one offered a lot more than that. Season one utilized the side characters very well, especially Chibita, and in this season, while he still is a great character, side characters were relegated to being vehicles for more inter-Matsuno banter and one-liners. There was no \"Iyami's Counterattack\" this season, no \"The Karamatsu Incident\", no \"Jyushimatsu Festival\", all episodes with fun premises that took advantage of the show's unique qualities.\n\nIf there's one thing the show does right, is that it actually manages to provide some good characterization for the sextuplets. For one thing, Karamatsu has actually become more self-assured in terms of not becoming the punching bag for the other five, often being allowed to get in his own insults and comments. But we also see his insecurity towards needing to do everything for his brothers in order to feel validation. Osomatsu is also given some much needed depth in the second to last episode, an aspect of his character that has been hinted at before but never completely explored until then, and the episode right after doesn't immediately erase all of it! These characters are very easy to turn into vapid stereotypes of their actual personalities, and there are instances where that does feel like the case, but more often than not they are consistently written with care, or at least as much care an irreverent sketch comedy show could have.\n\nThat's what keeps the show watchable for me: it still cares. Episodes like \"Iyami in the Wind\" and the two final episodes show that despite how flippant, bitter, and absurd the show is at times, there is something very genuine at the center of it, keeping the tradition of the 1988 series alive (and perhaps the writing of the original manga as well, although I have not read any of it so I cannot say for sure). Maybe the writing quality has been worsening, but I can tell that no one has given up, which gives me hope that if there is a third season, perhaps the writing staff could fix their flaws and create something as good as what I remember season one being. "}, {"id": 2539, "score": 60, "body": "The setting of Beyound the Boundary is really simple: There are monsters and guys that kill monsters. The comedy is created from the character traits of the cast: The protagonist really, really likes girls with glasses, the girl who tries to kill him is a shy girl with glasses. The best friend of the protagonist is really, really obsessed with his little sister, so they fantasize together about the little sister and what she would look like with glasses. This style of comedy is very simple, but at least not terrible. Beyond the boundary manages to at least write comedy that makes sense from what we know about the characters, for example when the poor girl with glasses sells pictures of her to a anonymous buyer with the initials of the protagonist.\n\nBut the comedy is not the main focus of the story. After episode 6, an episode that only consists of the friends fighting a monster that can be distracted by scantily dressed, singing girls, the story begins to speed up, but also gets worse to the end. That is the biggest problem of the show, it's not a bad show, but it is wasting its potential. The ending has a long emotional buildup, only to destroy the point of the whole fight and story in the last thirty seconds.\n\nThe characters are characters written for comedy. They have one or two defining character traits and have only little character development. We learn about their backstories and their motivations, but they never become really complex characters. That being said, the love for glasses of the protagonist is a funny idea, it's different to the normal love for little sisters or other questionalble likings, not that they don't exist in this show. The good thing about the characters is that they all are connected, no character is there for no real reason. \n\nOne of the biggest selling points is certainly the amazing animation, the fighting scenes are fluid and nice to watch. It\u00c2\u00b4s always nice if a bloodsword doesn\u00c2\u00b4t look like a bloodsword, but like a sword made of strange dirt.\n\nSure, good animation alone can't save an otherwise bad show, but Beyond the Boundary is not a bad show, it's better than most shows I watched. It's just sad that there is so much wasted potential. "}, {"id": 2540, "score": 50, "body": "Dagashi Kashi has potential, but fails in fully using it. Its cast is way too good compared to the rest of the show.\n\nI feel that the show could have been really good if it weren\u00c2\u00b4t for its focus on the candy - the core component of the show. What we got is a series of 24 minute commercials for japanese sweets with occasional good parts, the moment when the focus was on the characters and not on the sweets. The cast consists of only 5 people with a strong focus on Kokonotsu and Hotaru. There is a reason that Hotaru has more favorites on MAL than the show itself, she is a great character. While it seems at the beginning that she has some sort of higher goal you realize later that while she certainly likes Kokonotsu, she will forever only have one love: candy. As the daughter of one of the biggest Japanese candy producers, she knows EVERYTHING about every candy in Japan. That\u00c2\u00b4s why she wants Kokonotsu to take over the store of his father, he has to operate the store with his own big knowledge of candy. Because Kokonotsu has no intention at all to continue the store while still knowing a lot about it, the majority of the show consists of the two candy pros arguing about candy. That\u00c2\u00b4s the reason why the show is rated so low: It can be quite boring at times to listen to them talking about chocolate for the twentieth time in a row. The real highlight are the times when they meet the rest of the cast, the siblings Saya and Tou: With Tou\u00c2\u00b4s ability to be impressed by the simplest things and Saya\u00c2\u00b4s crush on Kokonotsu and her being constantly annoyed about the childing behaviour of everyone, we have everything we need to have comedy. But the comedy of seeing everyone\u00c2\u00b4s personality clash together is interrupted by candy commercials which can be funny at times, but often feel a few minutes too long.\n\nThe character design is good, everyone looks like you would expect them by their personalities while the minimalistic art makes them rememberable(look at Hotaru\u00c2\u00b4s pupils) and the animation is quite good.\n\nDagashi Kashi is a show that I would recommend for the great characters and the comedy, if you can look behind the bad to mediocre story. Personally, I think that this season should have been a 15-minute short while the second season should have gotten full 24 minutes because they realized that people wanted more Hotaru and others and less of the candy talk."}, {"id": 2549, "score": 60, "body": "Ah, yes, New Game! The show with undoubtedly the most impressive animation this season. What's it about, you ask? Cute autistic girls who work at a video game company, of course. Look, I get it.

I get that Doga Kobo doesn't exactly have the track record to take on something dark and gritty, but the team is very obviously so fucking talented that I can't not get pissed at a show like this existing when it looks this damn good.\n\nYou'd think that after I just bashed this show, I'd say that I'd hate it, and to a point I do, but inside of it's genre of cute-girls-cute-shit SoL genre, it's really not that bad. It's got all the same pandering and canned jokes that every other series of this same type does, and it's a strangely warm and relaxing experience to watch. I don't know much about how a Japanese office works, but in terms of a development office, it was at least sort of relate-able to me. The programmer, Umiko, and obviously best girl Hifumi were the only two stand out characters for me. However, as you'd expect, all the character designs are unique enough and downright adorable, so I'm sure you'll find something to like if this genre is your thing. OP is also above average and has some really cute animation.\n\nThis show's biggest problem is that it's not Love Lab or Nozaki-kun while still having the same super high quality Doga Kobo constant sakuga.

This one's is pretty good: our main character's love interest (note: love interest, not the MC herself) is an otaku artist who is obsessed with nothing more than drawing the perfect anime waifu. In fact, it's the only reason he's in the struggling art club. \n\nHilarity ensues with miscommunications, misunderstandings, and all your standard school romcom faire centering around this core gimmick. Our MC, Usami, is still hopelessly in love with this guy even though he constantly states that he's \"not interested at all in 3D\" which instead of being overly annoying to the viewer, just makes us root for Usami even more. The rest of the characters are all pretty standard: energetic autismo loli, ditzy teacher, sleepy/dejected senpai, pretty-but-otaku love rival, etc..., but our core two are enough to keep the comedy funny enough to make it not feel like a slog.\n\nAesthetically this one is better than average for it's genre. The character designs are all super cute and endearing, and help push the overall light nature of the show. Animation and art pretty standard for the setting as you'd expect; not a lot of opportunities to strut your animation stuff in a school setting unless crazy stuff is happening (which it isn't). There is, however, an almost alarming amount of care taken when showing the beginnings of characters drawing, although this doesn't happen very option. There's also some particularly horrid and unnecessary CG in a few episodes which I'll leave to you to be surprised by.\n\n\"Light\" in general is a great word to describe this show, as it never starts to take itself seriously and instead just goes for the ride.

I'm aware that Love Live is ridiculously popular, and honestly after watching this I can see why.

Sunrise knows what they're doing to create boatloads of money with this franchise, and who am I to complain if they keep using the funding to keep making kick-ass Gundam OVAs? \n\nOne thing I do have to praise this show for is its use of CG. Love Live is a perfect example of how you can use CG in even the most important scenes and still have absolutely no one give a single fuck: perfect execution. Sunrise is straight up with you that parts of the dances WILL be CG, but the models are incredibly detailed and are constantly shot at angles that make you question whether or not they are CG. The backgrounds are also styled to make the models \"pop\" less off of them, and the blending is done very well. If you like J-pop, you'll love the music. If you don't, you're going to want to kill yourself. This alone will probably be the deciding factor in you watching this show.\n\nStorywise, Sunshine is criminally formulaic. The first half of the show is about recruiting all the 9 different members of the group, with sprinklings of \"drama\" placed about, and then ending in dreamlike song and dance sequence. There's a strong recurring theme of facing your fears and putting yourself out there even if you might fail, trying your best despite that. The moe \"comedy\" is alright at best, with 99% of it being tired spins on the same gags you've seen in every SoL show. The term generic is something I keep coming back to when trying to describe the plot and character elements of this show, and I think it describes that aspect of Sunshine pretty well. \n\nDespite all this bullshit, I still found myself guiltily enjoying this show, and for the life of me I really couldn't figure out why. But then, a shocking realization came to me...\n\nLove Live is literally the anime equivalent of Glee.\n\nAs someone with a history in performance, this song and dance spectacle shit is always entertaining to me. Glee and Love Live follow the same sort of formula and almost cater to the same type of demographic, except that you replace Glee's celebrity spotlight shit with Love Live's moe otaku pandering. The shows are even structured the same. Every episode is set up -> contrived school drama -> resolution -> song and dance, Glee just went out of its way to try to edgy sometimes with its drama while Love Live tries to be as diabetes level cute as it can while also being anime.\n\nAs much as I ended up guiltily enjoying it, I still can't bring myself to recommend it. It's still painfully average and generic even as just a slice of life, cute-girl-cute-shit show, just with a little more musical flair. Also there really aren't any Gundams in the show, which for a Sunrise production was really a massive letdown.\n\n[__For more from this season and others, check out my blog!__](http://thebeanwolf.blogspot.com/2016/09/summer-2016-anime-in-review.html)"}, {"id": 2556, "score": 65, "body": "We don't get to see mafia dramas much in anime, which is kind of weird to think about considering that American TV and movies are rich with mafia content. 91 Days started late this season, so at the time of my writing this there are still 3 whole episodes left, so I'll reserve much of my judgement on the plot and just give a wider range for my tentative score. The ending with a heavier drama such as this is of paramount importance, so recommending or discounting the series without having seen it wouldn't be doing the series justice. What I will say however is that 91 Days has had a consistently engaging plot from episode 1 onward. I regularly when watching show find myself thinking, \"Wait, that's it? It's already over?\" because I am so interested and invested in what is happening on screen. The plot in terms of a mafia drama is your standard revenge story on a prohibition era backdrop, but it's refreshing to see that kind of story in an anime and it's been well executed so far.\n\nThe aesthetics department is where this show really falls short. The art is wonky looking at times, and the animation outside of a few key scenes is overall pretty stiff and unnatural. The music also isn't much to write home about, especially when comparing it to another mafia period piece of anime like Baccano. The OP in particular feels really out of place, with the ED feeling more in line with what a show such as this should have for \"bookending\" music. Speaking of Baccano, I really wish FUNimation had picked this up for a broadcast dub starting earlier, because I think it would definitely help this show's immersion factor. Something about the 1930s and 1940s just feels off with Japanese VA, even if the voice work for the show is above average.\n\nOverall, a strong and enjoyable drama series with a mafia flair. Chances are you already know if you'll enjoy a series like this. FUNimation is doing a broadcast dub now, so I'd check that out first if can wait for it all to release.\n\n[__For more from this season and others, check out my blog!__](http://thebeanwolf.blogspot.com/2016/09/summer-2016-anime-in-review.html)\n                                                                                                                                                                                    \n      "}, {"id": 2564, "score": 60, "body": "God, I really kicked myself after recommending this show in my preview. Almost immediately after I posted my review, the show started to go downhill fast. The comedy started to lessen in effectiveness, Chitose became even more of a bitch (to the point where it was no longer endearing), and visual quality seemed to go straight down the tubes. This show came out of the gate firing, seemingly being a seiyuu-focused version of Shirobako with a little more snark and a little less realism, but ultimately falls flat. It gets some stuff right, like how seiyuu's are effectively forced into becoming a \"product\" in and of themselves rather than being respected as actresses. The show plays off this by showing how different types of seiyuus deal with it, with some blatantly rejecting it, others begrudingly accepting it, some honestly loving it (being otakus themselves), and others being too new to the business to really know any better. The bleak outlook on the industry is also pretty refreshing, as its more likely to be ridiculous in this way than the roses and sunshine that studios make it look to be from the outside.\n\nWhat the show gets terribly wrong is how to deliver any sort of honest message or resolution. Chitose not only continues, but is ENCOURAGED, to act like a diva effectively \"faking it until she makes it\", which even by the end of the series doesn't even seem to work. She appears to have a change of heart at the ending climax of the series, but in reality it just really all seems fake with her original attitude just being amplified instead of transformed. While I found her character endearing at first, expecting that she'd get knocked on her ass and humbled like a new kid at a Melee tournament, she just became more and more like the kind of player I hate with no true change to her character in sight. The same can be said about the subplot with the producer, where there appears to be resolution for the sake of the story even though he himself has not changed his character at all. \n\nAesthetically this show has a great look for what it is, with very good character designs, but the art and animation dropped off hard around episode 5. The Chitose reaction images that you see pasted around twitter are mostly from this earlier stage, as later faces and cuts when viewed in a still make me want to puke. \n\n[__For more from this season and others, check out my blog!__](http://thebeanwolf.blogspot.com/2017/01/fall-anime-in-review-2016.html)\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          "}, {"id": 2569, "score": 50, "body": "What started as something relatively novel for a harem comedy predictably fell flat in the later stages, although it kept it longer than I expected.

Like most of these kinds of shows, it introduced some eleventh-hour common enemy for all the love interests to pull against, but it was just so much more worse than the average implementation that it really ruined the whole experience for me. Maybe I just can't relate to this beautiful girl of a main character getting fawned over by all these dudes for these attempted serious beats to mean anything, but it just feels like a reverse-but-weaker implementation of the ending in the more male-focused versions of this kind of show that I've seen.\n\nVisuals were only what I'd refer to as \"shoujo-tastic\" and \"male-moe\". Everything else in the aesthetic department was just like this show overall, painfully average. I really can't stand to watch the bad/average versions of these kinds of shows anymore, especially when there actually are a good amount of better-than-average anime romcoms out there. I thought the \"reverse\" part of this show would add something, but in the end I guess it didn't.

This show had a good chunk of the anime community clamoring for more after the first few episodes. How could a witch flying around on an anti-tank rifle killing Nazis possibly be a bad thing? Well, it turns out that even the most novel or interesting of new intellectual properties can turn to shit given enough time. To be completely fair, Izetta was a slow burn when it comes to pure combustion into garbage, but I was naive to ignore the signs that showed up as early as the second episode. Overabundance of \"A-1 face\" character designs, steadily increasing amounts of fanservice to the point of absurdity, a growing amount of plot-convenient asspulls, and a glossing over of the ever-important political interactions (this is alternate WW2 after all) are some of the biggest shortcomings that this show came to present. The first few episodes were light on these though, and I'd be remiss if I didn't admit that I had bought into the show entirely at that point. You can check my season previews to see just how excited for it I was and how much promise I thought this series had (which it did), only for how dejected and sad I am here to tell you how it all turned out in the end. If you're still interested enough in the premise to check this one out, just know that although the action scenes are pretty good and well choreographed, it's not enough to save the show from the stark contrast between them and the political/fanservice/yuribait segments.\n\n\"What do you mean yuribait segments?\", you might ask. Well, this show was determined to incite a lesbian relationship between our two main female characters because it figured that it just couldn't be interesting or well-done enough on its own to warrant selling enough merchandise to make the property profitable. Many a scene of Fin\u00c3\u00a9 and Izetta laying on a bed or eating lunch together was enough to make me just want to puke with how the series' incredibly poor attempt to make this \"subtle\". Let's not even talk about the episode eleven hamfisted euphemism for sex (complete with orgasm) that not even Disney could have gotten away with without raising eyebrows. Yuri is more than fine in my book, but you have to do it right. If you're just going to bait it, do it like Hibike, but otherwise you better just go full Sakura Trick, because everything else is just going to make your \"product\" feel like garbage for any normal person to watch. Actually, I think that's a great way to sum up my feelings on Izetta as a whole. It's a product, and was designed to be that from the beginning. It never had any aspirations of being art, like Flip Flappers obviously did and succeeded in. What's sad is that I don't even think Izetta succeeded in being a successful product, with originally great, albeit generic, visuals and soundtrack grinding to a mediocre halt at about the halfway mark.\n\nI'd avoid this one unless you really just want to see how the premise plays out (poorly) and can let the bad stuff roll off. It's the only way you'll be able to stomach the rest of this series. \n\n[__For more from this season and others, check out my blog!__](http://thebeanwolf.blogspot.com/2017/01/fall-anime-in-review-2016.html)\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         "}, {"id": 2571, "score": 65, "body": "This show is a masterpiece of loli magical MMA fighting.

I know absolutely nothing about Nanoha other than that, and I have to say that I legitimately enjoyed this completely retarded show despite it. A lot of misgivings like the weird loli fanservice, the unexplained magic technology, and some strange character interactions are apparently par for the franchise, and although I don't consider that to affect how much they detract from the show, it's still enlightening to understand the deep-rooted and strange points of such an old franchise. Still, the concept is just so incredibly stupid and entertaining in and of itself that the occasionally good fight scenes and an endearing (but expected) theme of friendship and support were just icing on the cake. \n\nThe Nanoha bug crawls into the show's aesthetics as well. The music is scored to pop-y and friendly just like the kind of magical girl stuff you'd expect. The character designs are overly cutesy and mostly basic, sticking to one core color scheme or design to make characters easily recognizable (a design strategy I lovingly refer to as the \"autism Sonic effect\"). Animation is pretty average, with a couple of the fights being above average. The last fight between Fuka and Rinne is particularly well done and relatively hype, which really sends the series out on a high note. This series is a \"what you see is what you get\" affair. You could honestly watch the OP and have a perfect understanding of what you'd be getting into.\n\nIf you want to watch some cute girls beat the fucking shit out of each other while they have flashbacks about being friends, or you're just looking for a laugh, then check this one out I guess.

Is that a ridiculous enough premise for the show to be entertaining despite the preceding \"adaptation of a Steam game\" bit? Not exactly, or at least not by itself, but Akiba'S Trip has enough to keep you chuckling if you're a part of the right demographic. The show follows a \"monster-of-the-week\" type format, with our lovably ridiculous cast of tropes fighting a new enemy set in a differing realm of \"otaku-dom\". One week it's audiophiles and idols, the next it's r/pcmasterrace, then Akiba maid culture, and continuing with a new shtick each week. This will either help keep you interested or cause you to want to drop the show all together, because our cast of characters are largely boring and predictable. Otaku-turned-hero, tsundere love interest, imouto, ditzy-but-genius, loli professor... it's all here, along with a set of equally tired villains, side characters, and plot contrivances. They hinge on the edge of being parody, but I'll leave that up to you to decide.\n\nIt's worth noting that this show is even more of an advertisement than anime normally is. Companies and products are literally shouted out and endorsed by characters. Hell, there is an entire episode dedicated to Street Fighter V and the characters openly endorse Carl's Jr. hamburgers. Advertisements like these in TV shows and games can be done well or incredibly poorly, but the show's medium of anime comedy lets it play it off pretty damn well. Above all else, Akiba'S Trip is crazy and random, so the endorsements don't end up feeling that out of place and have a good bit of thought put into their gags. The Street Fighter episode in particular went pretty far to be an accurate parody of a tournament, and even cameo'd numerous Japanese and American FGC players. \n\nUnfortunately, it's painfully obvious that Studio Gonzo needed every penny it could scrounge from those advertisements to make this show. The visual quality of the show is just absolutely downright terrible. The animation literally melts together and the still frames are nothing to look at. Character designs are uninspired, obviously not being designed with animation in mind (lifted from the game). There's also a ton of ham-fisted fanservice that fails to even achieve its purpose due to poor animation and art. The only time the show looked alright was the first episode, notably the first fight, and then it was straight downhill from there. Music is also forgettable to downright bad outside of one or two hype tracks. VA is... actually consistently funny and a joy to listen to, and you can tell that the voice actors and actresses had a great time recording this ridiculous show. The simulcast dub also seems to have been made with \"fun\" in mind, giving off a subtle Ghost Stories sort of vibe and is worth checking out since you're going to be picking this show up for a quick laugh if you end up picking it up at all.\n\nOverall, Akiba'S Trip can be a fun romp if you're not expecting too much out of it other than a couple clever pop culture jokes and stabs at otakus. It's by no means a pinnacle of comedy or parody within anime, but it's a good look for some laughs or a group watch, even if some of the laughs are from unintended sources. If I could compare it to anything, it would be that it's kind of like discount Ben-To.\n\n[__For more from this season and others, check out my blog!__](http://thebeanwolf.blogspot.com/2017/03/winter-2017-anime-season-in-review.html)"}, {"id": 2579, "score": 50, "body": "In rare form for Doga Kobo, Gabriel DropOut just really isn't that great.

Yeah, there's this ultra cerebral joke about how the angels are the corrupted ones and the demons are the kind ones, but that joke got old before episode one ended. The most unique thing in actuality with this show is that Gab, our main character, is a sarcastic NEET and Satania is full on chuunibyou, which are two things you really don't see in this genre very often.

Just go watch Love Lab or even rewatch K-On! or something; this genre is already over-saturated with shows far better than this.\n\n[__For more from this season and others, check out my blog!__](http://thebeanwolf.blogspot.com/2017/03/winter-2017-anime-season-in-review.html)\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n"}, {"id": 2583, "score": 55, "body": "Fat sad boy gets mad that girl turns him down so he weight trains for years to become an attractive high school guy only to be faced with the same girl that turned him down all those years ago! Wanting to get back at her, he vows to get revenge by baiting this girl into falling in love with him, then rejecting her the same way she did to him. All manner of wacky anime romantic comedy things occur based on this set-up, and I'll have to give this one credit for at least trying to have an original set-up. The problem is that this plot creates more problems than it solves, and the rest of the show just falls directly into the same generic pitfalls that nearly all romcom anime fall into, like introducing random additional suitors for no reason, incredibly hamfisted melodrama, and an eleventh hour additional conflict that just feels out of place. Characters are also wholely generic, and I just gave you most of the unique stuff, but I'll hit on the rest real quick: typical tsundere heroine, silent-but-deadly, bad Marika rip-off church girl competitor, otokonoko, student council president, etc... etc... Oh, and a 9/12 episode entering direct competitor for our health-nut MC Masamune, who uses \"his\" portly figure to try to assume Masamune's past identity and \"steal his girl\". This is all standard faire, and it's honestly what we should expect from the cover art. \n\nHowever, what's surprising is that this show is actually one notch above average its genre. Even though the characters are all the same tired archetypes we've seen before, the premise is slightly unique enough to keep you at least remotely interested, and the sins that the series commits based on this plot (\"I somehow forget everything but remembered LEL ecks dee\") are honestly no more ridiculous than what you'd find in its average and less-than-average contemporaries. The main character's internal fight against actually falling for the would-be victim of his revenge (spoiler alert: he falls for her OH NO I SPOILED IT) is pretty funny to watch, as is Adagaki's attempts to remain the man-hating attitude that she is known for. One particular point that always made me laugh was just how little any of the important characters gave a fuck that Masamune had put so much work into himself. He's almost made fun of for putting so much time into his self-improvement, although he doesn't help his own case since the results of his work just made him a pompous ass.\n\nThis one might be worth a look if you're starved for romcoms. Aesthetics are completely forgettable but not terrible, and in true romcom fashion, the story doesn't end. Fair warning: I read ahead and the actual ending of this series is complete shit, so if the hinted OVA actually comes to fruition, they'd better go for an anime original ending or at least flesh out the original one/make it less retarded. I don't have high hopes for that, and its not fair to judge the anime on it anyway, but it's something I wanted to mention before closing the book on this one.\n\n[__For more from this season and others, check out my blog!__](http://thebeanwolf.blogspot.com/2017/03/winter-2017-anime-season-in-review.html)\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            "}, {"id": 2586, "score": 60, "body": "So this isn't exactly an airing show, but it DID release in this past winter season and I DID pay a whopping $15 to go see it, so I figured I'd share my thoughts on it. I was and always will be someone who will at least partially defend the Aincrad arc of the original SAO; it wasn't anything great from a narrative standpoint and had one hell of an ass-pull to cap it off, but it was executed very well and was a very aesthetically pleasing experience. Hell, SAO is what got me back into watching anime in college, and even if it is an over-hyped, well-polished turd (especially Fairy Dance and season two), I can at the very least respect its popularity. As someone who went in to Sword Art Online: Ordinal Scale with this very prototypical anime-snob opinion of SAO at the ready, I have to say that I was honestly surprised. \n\nNow don't get it twisted here, Ordinal Scale is very firmly still SAO. The overall plot is forgettable, and simply a vehicle to get us into fights and show Kirito and Asuna in romance sequences. You still have your array of stupid and useless characters like Lizbeth and Silica. The plot is still incredibly forced and laden with ass-pulls and plot conveniences. Yui \"Deus-Ex Machina Incarnate\" still fucking exists to call Kirito \"papa\". This is all that stupid shit that makes SAO..., well, SAO, and without it I don't think that the series would be as monolithically popular is it is. If you stripped ALL that crap out, you'd have one of the most drop-dead gorgeous, technically impressive, and great sounding anime action movies that I have ever fucking seen in my LIFE, but all that \"SAO bullshit\" just drags you out of the experience and straight into the gutter. The ending fight in particular, where it's essentially just pure fanservice and bad-assery highlighting every character in the cast, was the most hype I have ever felt about SAO and likely ever will be. That is, unless they somehow kill off every male character, bring Yuuki back to life, and make a slice-of-life about her and Asuna living together.\n\nAnd it's worth noting here that I'm not even ragging on the Kirito/Asuna romance, which seems to ALWAYS be a point of criticism when discussing this series. Their relationship was always more well thought out and respectable than any offering from SAO's contemporaries, which has always been due in part to the fact that Asuna is far and away the best character. I can say without shame that their romance sections of this movie were definitely the plot highlights for me, giving Kirito a chance to act like an actual fucking human instead of a faceless edgedark husk of a killing machine. Their relationship is a far cry from something like Toradora's Taiga and Ryuji, but Asuna and Kirito are believable and charming enough in a world where everyone still plays video games despite almost being brutally murdered inside one. \n\nIf you're an SAO mega-fan and think that I'm an asshole for even attempting to criticize it, get the fuck out of your house and see this movie right now, preferably in the nicest theater you can. It'll be everything that you ever wanted, and it's a true sequel to the Aincrad arc for the series. Those who are more on my side of things should still go see it, as I'd say it's a technical marvel for a mainstream anime movie that didn't come flowing out of Miyazaki's skull. This is the best thing to come out of the SAO franchise since its initial adaptation, and although that might not be much more than \"meh\", at least it keeps bringing along something that's nice to look at and listen to. One day, it would be nice to see this series shake off the bullshit and grow into its aesthetic.\n\n...but SAO will always still be SAO, and that's the fucking problem."}, {"id": 2587, "score": 65, "body": "If you've been with me on one of my seasonal review journies before, you'll know that I'm a huge sucker for short-form anime in pretty much any form, whether it be a shortened episode count like Planetarian or an actual short like Aho-Girl here. Now Aho-Girl definitely doesn't do anything new, and it certainly isn't anything high-brow, but I'd be lying through my teeth if I didn't say I was having a good bit of fun with this show. If I had to sum up this series in just a few words, they would be \"simple and endearing\", and Aho-Girl leverages its shortened runtime of ~14 minutes beautifully to this effect. Speaking of \"simple\", the art here is possibly one of the closest to what I'd consider the \"bare minimum\" for being acceptable. Character designs are quite honestly downright boring, and the frame count is pretty low. It's never exactly hard to watch, but it doesn't have anything aesthetically that stands out either. The only exception somewhat is the short OP, which is typically spun into some kind of joke in and of itself.\n\nKeeping with the same theme here, \"simple\" also perfectly describes what you're going to get with this show, because the title literally gives it away: it's about how much of an idiot Yoshiko is and the trouble she causes. The rest of our cast is a pretty well-executed romcom standard with the exception of our other main, A-kun, who isn't having any of Yoshiko's idiocy. The comedy is the expected mix of extremely fast-paced, romcom-staple jokes and a heavy dose of slapstick, so you'll know pretty quickly whether you find it funny or tired. The shortened runtime is key in this regard, as I can see Aho-Girl easily running itself into the ground with a 24 minute runtime. You can really only see Yoshiko get hit in so many different ways before it stops being funny, but sidestepping this with shortened episodes is a welcome and effective choice in making the tired and overdone into something fun and enjoyable again.\n\n[__For more from this season and others, check out my blog!__](http://thebeanwolf.blogspot.com/2017/10/summer-2017-anime-in-review.html)\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "}, {"id": 2597, "score": 61, "body": "Now this was quite a hard anime for me to score. There were parts I liked and parts I disliked, a few that made me smile and rather more that made me cringe. On the whole I gave it a 6/10, which is not a bad score by any means. It just shows that I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enjoy it as much as some other anime.\n\nFirst off, just let me say that the opening and endings are great. Catchy and fun, and it was a really nice idea to have each character sing one personalised ending song \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it brought a little more life into the anime. The other sounds complemented the setting, and the voice actors suited most of the characters well (it was a talented cast, after all).\n\nI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find much fault with the art or animation either, the art beautifully detailed (especially in regard to the main characters), generally matching the mood (and actually quite cute in the chibi moments "}, {"id": 2599, "score": 63, "body": "An interesting show that starts off well, but ultimately goes down-hill after it decides to ignore the mysteries and instead introduce a massive cast of one-dimensional characters. \n\nOkay, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not as bad as that makes it sound. There are parts of the series that are seriously good, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d still definitely recommend it to people that liked anime like Zetsuen no Tempest or other magic/action shows with a lot of exposition.\n\nThe world building was really good, and succeeded in creating a intriguing society that had only fairly recently begun to harness magic as a form of science. There were some big mysteries in the air, such as \u00e2\u0080\u0098What is the story behind Tatsuya and Miyuki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship? Why do no two people seem to have the same powers when magic is just a form of science? Why is most of the B set filled with kids who are just as talented (if not more so), than the kids in the A set? Why on earth do we never see any of their teachers? What on earth are the terrorists even after? And why is the military so incredibly incompetent that it places national security in the hands of a few teenage kids?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nUnfortunately most of the mysteries were unresolved by the end, which left the series hanging a bit and with an \u00e2\u0080\u0098unfinished\u00e2\u0080\u0099 feel. The last arc was by far the most confusing, everything was just thrown together and felt rushed. It was also a big shift in tone from the first two arcs, which were mainly centred in school and around school related activities.\n\nThe MC was probably the best part of the series (unlike his sister). A refreshing change \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the overpoweredness in this case made the anime better instead of boring. It was actually fun this time to watch a really OP character instead of irritating, and I even found myself wanting to see more of him (which is rare, because normally I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand characters who are that far above everyone else). \n\nA lot of the side characters were interchangeable and forgettable but there were still some good ones: Erika, Mikihito, and Sayaka were developed decently. I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand Miyuki. She was the worst part of the anime by far \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in fact the only terrible part of the anime. It really did feel like she was only used as a plot device to show how awesome the MC is - which wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even necessary because the anime did a perfectly good job of portraying his powers without her help. Seriously, literally every comment was somehow related to her brother. She didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist outside of her brother complex, which sucked. She could have been an interesting character if she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d had a little more depth to her personality, or a little more character development. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supposedly overpowered, but if she is it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t portrayed very well in the anime.\n\nHowever, one bad character couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ruin the anime altogether. The plot was fun. There was a lot of talking, but it was interesting. the fight scenes were nicely choreographed. The mystery was intriguing, and did leave me wanting to see what happened next (more in the beginning than the end). The competitions were entertaining, even if they weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t particularly exciting. The art was lovely, the magic especially was well illustrated and is very pleasant to look at. The character designs were pretty, the backgrounds were gorgeous, and the sound was fine. All positives.\n\nOverall, it was a decent anime. There were parts of it that were good, and parts there weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. there were parts I liked, and parts I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. But I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t call it a \u00e2\u0080\u0098bad\u00e2\u0080\u0099 anime; the positives did outweigh the negatives in the end.\n\nSo again, I would recommend it to fans of its respective genres. Just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect to be blown away by its brilliance.

The anime is divided into a series of shorts each a few minutes long; there are normally about 4 or 5 per episode. Each is a small self-contained story about Takagi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and Nishikata\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daily lives in and out of the classroom. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a plot-heavy series and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not meant to be. What it is meant to be, however, is a character-oriented series, and so that shall be my main focus.\n\nJust to get the art and music out of the way: the art style is really cute. Huge heads, massive eyes (even by anime standards), high foreheads and relatively simple drawings altogether. It suits the characters and show style nicely without being too extravagant. The animation is done well, even if not much is being animated besides the characters. The music is good, nothing spectacular but again, just nice. No complaints on these areas.\n\nSo now to the characters. There are the two main characters, Nishikata and Takagi, who take up the majority of the shorts, and then there are a few supporting characters (a trio of girls in the same class) who feature every now and again. Nishikata and Takagi engage in a variety of activities, from making bets with each other to tandem riding to doing homework or going shopping. All basic daily activities, and nothing really happens in any of them event-wise, but they provide a lot of opportunities for exchanges between the two. \n\nNishikata seems to take these exchanges as mental matches between the two of them - constant sparring to see who comes out on top verbally. He reads deeply into every single thing Takagi says, wondering if she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trying to tease him and then trying to play bluff and double bluff. Whilst it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true that Takagi does slyly tease him a fair amount of the time, watching him thoroughly analyse every single little sentence of hers becomes irritating after a while.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obvious to the viewer (although not to Nishikata) that her teasing is well-intentioned and that she actually likes him, perhaps even has feelings for him. (The latter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shown more subtly until the last couple of episodes.) Nishikata does seem to like her (hence the blushing) but the feelings seem to be pretty pure and innocent. In any case, her teasing is always incredibly mild. If she wins a bet and gets the opportunity to order Nishikata to do anything she wants, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just choose something like going shopping together or another harmless activity.\n\nNishikata, however, sees every single tease as a personal failure, and a blow to his pride. He never seems to be able to best her in anything, and to be fair to him this is probably incredibly frustrating. But it never ends! He never actually tries to talk to her properly about anything! He never tells her unequivocally to stop teasing him, because it would be a \u00e2\u0080\u0098loss\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to let her know that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gotten to him. He just makes every exchange, no matter how harmless, into a mental sparring match and thus causes his own inferiority complex to worsen, because she always \u00e2\u0080\u0098beats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 him. (Even when there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing to \u00e2\u0080\u0098beat\u00e2\u0080\u0099 him on \u00e2\u0080\u0093 sometimes she just asks him a simple question that is literally only an attempt to make small talk.) \n\nThere is almost no character development whatsoever. If you look at the beginning episodes, and compare them to the later ones, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll notice barely any change. She still talks to him and teases him in the same way she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always done, and he still tries and fails to best her the same way he always has. \n\nThis was the main flaw of the anime, as a character-driven series. The characters just become boring after a while, you can predict almost exactly what will happen and how it will happen. Even Takagi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s initially adorable laugh becomes grating after hearing it every few minutes, episode after episode.\n\nThe show does try to add a few more characters into the mix, but they suffer from the same problem of one-dimensionalitis. Their exchanges are also cute, sometimes funny and sometimes boring, but I think the only reason I liked these three girls was that they were a break from the endless cute monotony that was Takagi and Nishikata\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exchanges. They were nothing special in and of themselves.\n\nIn conclusion, I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say that I dislike Skilled Teaser Takagi-san. Whilst I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly look forward to it every week, it has a lot of sweet moments, and it does have a few funny parts. I just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t binge watch it. If you want to try it, I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recommend watching more than one or two episodes at a time, with a large break in between sessions. That should keep it from getting too tedious, and instead just be a cute and mildly comedic series.

I have to give credit where credit is due even if this still feels kind of like a stamp-out riding on Madoka's wave: this show is smarter and more heartfelt than it seems from the outset. Our main characters form a very non-traditional but believable family dynamic. Sana in particular has the trait of complete honesty through total ignorance that never fails to be endearing, while Zouroku's dedication to serving as the family figurehead and protector despite his age is also a joy to watch. For every gruesome or dark moment (and there are a LOT), there is a heartwarming one to balance it out. \n\nUnfortunately this is where a lot of the non-aesthetic positives end. The show suffers from a clean line narrative split, having two separate \"mini-seasons\". While this isn't inherently a negative, the pacing issues and changes in overall tone are stark and off-putting. In the first half, the plot screams by with heavy doses of action, while the second half grinds to a halt and focuses more on cute family moments with sprinklings of existential dread until the very end. Throughout both halves, there are major issues with character motivations with almost every major character outside the first half's main antagonist and Sana herself. Zouroku's drive to do anything seems to come from nowhere other than that he hates \"crooked stuff\", and the goals of the two seemingly warring factions and their underlings are seemingly nonexistent. Sanae is also particularly useless other than to provide a motherly figure for Sana while still creating a more \"broken\" (and therefore predisposed to greater view sympathy) family structure, and could likely be completely removed without consequence. Overall, the show really can't seem to decide if it really wants to get dark or if wants to be a cute comedy that just plays with trend of dark magical girl shows. The whole package would have been much stronger if it could have decided, and kept an already shorter series to one narrative arc.\n\nWhen it comes to the visuals, J.C. Staff did about as good as a job as they normally do, albeit with some really, REALLY terrible CGI in the early episodes (that car chase still gives me nightmares). The character designs can't really decide if they want to Madoka or Alien Nine, sort of skirting the line and not being particularly powerful in either way. If I had to give any major aesthetic props to the series, it would be the first half's fight scenes, the second half's Wonderland sections, and the general effect composting for Dreams of Alice powers. Audio is good but doesn't have any standout tracks or moments, and does its job well enough. VA for Zouroku is really the only standout out of the bunch, with the rest being your usual smattering of anime tropes and typical voices.\n\nFor me, Alice and Zouroku really aired at a poor time to make much of an impact. At this same time it was airing, I was in the progress of rewatching Madoka + Rebellion, and I couldn't help but compare the effectiveness of this sort of \"cute plus dread\" vibe that they both sort of give off. Alice and Zouroku is much more muted in this, and focuses a lot more on the importance and signifigance of family, but that sort of \"this is cute but something is wrong\" feeling is always there. If you're someone that prefers something that really tries to play both sides, then this series might be better for you, but as someone who would rather watch two series that went harder in one way or the other, I can't really wholeheartedly recommend it.\n\n[__For more from this season and others, check out my blog!__](http://thebeanwolf.blogspot.com/2017/07/spring-2017-anime-season-in-review.html)\n\n                                                                                                                                       "}, {"id": 2623, "score": 50, "body": "Remember DanMachi? That show that everyone loved because of the boob strings? Well it's back, this time without (much) Hestia and Bell, slotting them out for over-popular kuudere Ais and a new character, Lefiya. The story follows the same timeline as the original show, just from Ais' point of view rather than Bell's, hence the show's status as a \"spin-off\" of the core series. The question that everyone is looking for the answer to: is a lack of Hestia and yuri undertones enough to save such a intellectually bankrupt and boring concept? Well, it's definitely not, but it's thankfully somehow more palatable than its parent.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, Lefiya is equally the main character of the series with Ais herself. Most of the plot of the show centers on Lefiya's (seemingly sexual) interest in Ais and becoming stronger in order to support both her and her familia, which take the place of all of the original DanMachi's cringe-inducing Hestia fanservice moments. This the largest (and I'd really argue ONLY) reason why this spin-off is better than the original, as our slotted-out cast is simply more compelling. The Loki familia in general is more interesting than Hestia's, as it actually has members and relationships, even if those relationships are incredibly canned and trite. Lefiya, despite having the same drive as Bell (\"I love Ais\"), is more interesting simply because of the fact that she doesn't wholly break the rules like he does, and is a \"support-based class\" rather than a dagger-touting everyman. The actual plot is the same sort of \"the monsters were smart and had a plan all along\" bullshit, but has more actual information than the original telling of the story, so it's far more interesting to follow and I could totally see someone who is really bought in to this world really enjoying it. To the rest of us, it's a pretty stereotypical anime plot.\n\nAesthetically this series is pretty much identical to the original. Good, but not great, and carried by character design like every other harem fantasy series. We do get some good animation when Ais is fighting, but also a lot of straight re-used animation from the original when Bell's and Ais' points-of-view cross. Music is incredibly forgettable to downright bad, as is most of the VA. Fans of DanMachi are really only here for one thing though, so if you were worried about the girls not looking cute, fret not. With that in mind, I guess Sword Oratoria fulfills it's aesthetic expectations.\n\nFor the life of me, I just can't get why they didn't just move forward with the original story. It's not like Hestia and Bell weren't a popular duo, because they were despite Hestia being one of the worst harem characters in recent memory. Going back to do a spin-off an entire year after your successful series seems to be either an admission of money-grabbing, requiring minimal actual writing, or just a lack of confidence in the actual material that comes later, which is also very likely given the objective quality of DanMachi as an IP. Fans of DanMachi are going to have plenty to like here, but it's really only a minor patch to an otherwise forgettable soft-isekai crank-out.\n\n[__For more from this season and others, check out my blog!__](http://thebeanwolf.blogspot.com/2017/07/spring-2017-anime-season-in-review.html)\n"}, {"id": 2626, "score": 60, "body": "Everyone's favorite meta-harem, Saekano, is back for a second season with one of the densest harem MCs known to man and the same host of meaninglessly head-of-heels girls for him to turn away. Or at least, that's what you'd think from watching the first season, or even from this season's ultra-fanservice \"episode zero\". This season took a much different direction, planning to splice some sort of strange misplaced philosophy about being a \"creative\" needing to be scourned to be challenged and grow inbetween the painfully abundant fanservice shots. That aside, Saekano's strange form of meta-humor manages to abound, skirting the line between making fun of being a harem show, yet at the same time fully embracing being a harem show. Although this season tried very earnestly to push the series closer to a character drama than a comedy, the same uncanny valley of the humor (my main issue with the first season) is still there, making everything seem stupid and meaningless instead of some sort of actual \"meta\" humor.\n\nThose Utaha and Eriri scale figures flew off the shelves, and A-1 definitely knows it. Shot composition in general is almost entirely for the purposes of showing off the girls at any given moment. If one of our core female cast is on screen, expect SOME sort of compromising camera angle, even when the series is trying to get serious. Everything outside the character design and facial animation is beyond forgettable; there's no real movement that's worth speaking of. Same goes for the music and sound, as nothing really stands out as even remotely notable.\n\nIn my opinion, Saekano gets points over the average for a harem series by at least heavily delivering on what most people believe they are promised when they sit down for one of these shows (sans any actual romance), but I fail to see the real appeal as to why this particular harem series is as popular as it is. If the character designs are really that strong (and I think they very well might be), then so be it, but the rest of the show and especially the attempts at meta-humor really fall \"flat\" for me...\n\nI'll see myself out.\n\n[__For more from this season and others, check out my blog!__](http://thebeanwolf.blogspot.com/2017/07/spring-2017-anime-season-in-review.html)\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "}, {"id": 2631, "score": 60, "body": "This anime is actually an allegory for Otaku culture in Japan. \n\nAlthough our MC (in this case analogous to Japanese male youth) is surrounded by peers and women who would be willing to be with him, he instead focuses on an unobtainable fantasy (a little sister). In the same way that it is literally impossible for our \"hero\" to get an imouto, it is literally impossible for the average Otaku to have his fantasy fulfilled. However, women in his life do not represent women, they represent the idea of opportunity. Nayu represents the simple-to-obtain release of hedonistic desires (the present). Myaa represents the long-term goals of every person (the future). However, our knight-in-shining-armor instead continues to seek to obtain the unobtainable. \n\nFurthermore, we see MC's friend acting as a representation of the crushed dreams of youth. The best part of having a goal is the buildup to it. Once a dream is reached it becomes the status-quo and thus becomes uninteresting and typically disappointing. Another idea explored in his character is the flawed personal hero. MC looks up to his friend as being a success, someone who he should look up to. However, internally the friend looks at MC as the truly successful one. The friend's character holds this duality from about the midway point onwards. The friend is in love with a woman who loves MC, he (through his own denseness) doesn't see that he is the more successful of the two. MC has independence, the women, the money, and the loyal fanbase.\n\nThe anime that MC and his friend strive to achieve narratively represents success. When the friend obtains his anime adaptation, it's nothing like he'd hoped. Things (seemingly) out of his control lead to it being a complete flop. This is meant to act as a cautionary tale to MC, but despite this, he charges head-first into a premature success that has doomed so many around him. \n\n\n\nThe anime chooses to end on a hopeful note for the group's (representing Japan's youth) future. MC admits his romantic feelings for Nayu (a woman who has been throwing herself at him for the entire show, usually literally), and he gets his anime greenlit (one of the ultimatums he set for himself to confess his romantic feelings).

Many memories were made from it, and new friends were met because of it. So I thought to myself that as a gamer, this anime would definitely stick out to me. It definitely did, in more ways than one. \n\nMisunderstandings: The Anime has something going for it. Brought to you by Studio Pine Jam\n\nWe have our MC, Keita, who seems to be one of the most passionate people for gaming. He does almost nothing but look down on his phone, doing what he does best: gaming.\n\nIn Keita, I see myself. Although not as addicted as he is, I certainly do have a great passion for gaming. We then have our famous blonde, Karen. Seen as the popular girl, but really is something else at heart: She is also a gamer. Seeing that Keita has similarities to her, she then decides to take action and get him to join the video games club. Of course, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not too easy.\n\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take a moment to appreciate the opening sequence of the series. The amount of references to games I played is phenomenal and brings back nostalgia. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure some of you who might be reading this might feel the same. Street fighter, Resident Evil, Super Smash Bros, a Tales Game (Phantasia I'm sure), to even PUBG! Of course I haven't played all these games, but I sure do recognize them.\n\nThe art is not too appealing, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enough to keep me watching. Of course, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pretty unknown studio doing this, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not doing that bad of a job. \n\nIt seems that misunderstandings in the anime will be a main focus in the anime, as expected since it did say that in the synopsis. \n\nKeita is someone that enjoys the games he personally likes, and actually doesn't prefer playing games that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t appeal to them. Even though he was offered as chance to join the club, he prefers playing games his own ways. That is something I can appreciate about his character. I mean, he was practically forced to play CS:GO. It hurts considering he plays so\u00e2\u0080\u00a6badly. But of course, it seems to be his first time with fps. So no complaints.\n\nOverall the main focus of the anime tries to give us clusters of situations leading to misunderstandings. If you don't like that type of thing, I would suggest staying away. Trust me, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like misunderstandings too much either. However, my passion for gaming overloads that concern, and I started watching anyway.\n\nIf you like comedy, awesome character interactions, and many gaming references, pick this up.\nIf you want a complete romance series without any misunderstandings, this ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the one for you (unless in the future it somehow changes into that type of anime, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see it happening anytime soon.)\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this series so as a gamer and anime only.

It takes place in a prestigious school where the good and the great are separated. Or in this case, the good and the bad. However, just as I feared, it started to fall off quite a bit.\n\nCOTE started off quite strongly, with an intense atmosphere in the first couple of episodes. It supposedly grasped the attention of the viewers and it sure has grabbed mine. We see early the ambitions or goals of some of the people in Class D, which is to get to class A together. While some may strive to reach this goal, some others rather not care.\n\nSome of the problems that occurred in the series is the feeling of rushed pacing, although not quite. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not terribly rushed, but I feel like they wanted to get things done faster than usual. But one of my main concerns lie within the inconsistent storyline, where things are just clustered and messed up.\n\nIn the beginning it was fine that the fact that the show was a narrative, but now I think that they tried just a little too hard to be a narrative focused show at this point. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeep\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeaningful\u00e2\u0080\u009d seeming dialogue felt a bit weak and felt like it had little impact for me to care at all about it.\n\nOne of my main problems with COTE lies within the lack of any sort of character growth throughout the series. I feel like they tried to focus the anime too hard on our 2 main characters Ayanokoji and Suzune. Even with all that focus on those 2 I still didn't feel any significant development between the 2 besides becoming friends or something.\n\nStill regarding the characters, they like they had no significant role since most of the focus were on our main characters. Which is a shame because I would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve loved to see more and learn more about some certain characters. Something that I didn't appreciate was how some character reveals something, but after that, it becomes irrelevant to the story whatsoever. It felt like they just threw it to the side and we see either little or none of those reveals anymore.\n\nNow to talk about the fan service. Listen, I am someone who does not mind fan service whatsoever. I will admit, the fan service in this series is good. The girls make you wanna bust a nut and the art quality when it comes to the service is tremendous I will give them that. However, I feel like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been used wrongly and just for the sake of fan service of course. I feel like they tried to somehow tie that into some sort of plot progression and I didn't like that.\n\nNow with the problems concerning Ayanokoji. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get me wrong I did enjoy his character and how he was initially written. I feel as though they didn't bring out his true potential as a Main Character. I felt like more could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been done to give him a more fully developed type of character.\n\nThe initial goal of reaching class A started to fade while the second half of the series played. Honestly, it felt like I was watching 2 seasons of a show into one 12 episode anime. They start leaving things that were probably critical plot and left it behind, later one there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no real connection between the situations that were given to us.\n\nOverall this anime was a disappointment, although it had its moments and it was still kinda entertaining, it still failed in executing a proper written story that had a nice concept at the beginning. The only things I can praise about regarding this series is the beautiful art and animation as well as the soundtrack. Even if this anime fell off later one, they still kept the same uncomfortable atmosphere throughout the show, well executed or not. It is indeed a shame however that it was only 12 episodes. If Classroom of The Elite had more time and episodes to develop the story as well as the characters with a good written narrative, I truly believed that this could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been a fantastic anime.

With only 11 episodes, it lacked the space to allow the characters and the world of grow and just told us the pure story. Which without the support of character development, felt like it kinda failed to deliver a  story that was as strong as Psycho-Pass 1.\n__Characters__\nThe weakest part of this show for me by far. Akane sticks around, and continues to be a strong character. Who as shown in Psycho-Pass 1 will continue to hold onto her beliefs, even when everyone is attempting to make her break. And while I feel she has changed some from Psycho-Pass 1, we don't see a ton of that change. She spends a ton of time moving from plot point to plot point, without any downtime to explore how much Psycho-Pass 1 really effected her. Which seems to be an issue I have with all the characters in Psycho-Pass 2. We get introduced to a number of new characters, many of which had a ton of potential to grow into great characters. Its just that we don't get a chance to see the characters just talk without an imminent threat coming. \nCharacters like Sho Hinakawa, get teases occasionally of character development. At least telling us about the history of the character, and yet after a single scene it is never brought up again, and kinda just fades. Until the only thing left of Sho is he is the shy red hair guy who is good at computers. \nThe other main Inspector in Psycho-Pass 2; Mika Shimotsuki gets a fair bit of development throughout the show. But can probably but summed up as believing 100% in the system, and doesn't want to deviate from the system. She is said to have a surprisingly clear psycho-pass, but we never really learn why this is. It is just stated as a fact near the end of the show, the only reason really mentioned that I can think of for it being so clear, is her near cultist belief in the system.  \nSakuya Togane, an enemy that was created to be a villain from creation. We get flashes of his backstory, but it is never overly explored. His main drive seems to be the person he sees as his mother, who is now part of the system. He did a decent job of being a kinda unhinged looming threat throughout the show. We are told early on to watch him, and it isn't till we get close to the end that we understand why. \nI guess the main villain would be Kirito Kamui, who following the trend of Psycho-Pass 1 isn't really a villain or a hero. He seeks out the Sibyl System in order to force a change in the world. A change that he sees as necessary in order to feel like he has a place in this world and gain judgement. I enjoyed his development, seeing how he came to be invisible to the system. And how caring the burden of all these people has drawn him to want to create a change. While I would have loved to see more development for his character, expanding on beliefs even more. It did a pretty good job the time given to it. \n__Music, Art, Sound__\nStarting with both the OP and ED, loved them really. Enjoyed them at least enough that I didn't feel like skipping them like I do many shows. While in general, the music and sound effects throughout the show did a good job. It did what was necessary, and helped to elevate scenes when needed.  While the art throughout was really good. Kept the style that I would expect, and was high quality pretty much everywhere you looked. The explosions from the Dominators where just as messy as you would expect.\n__Story__\nWhile the story developed strongly, and came to a definite satisfying ending personally. I can't help but feel like it was let down by the characters, which would have helped it have more of an impact. Feel like some changes unfortunately ended up occurring to things from Psycho-Pass 1, but I can give shows some freedom when it comes to shifting things somewhat to allow a story to come together. The idea of the paradox was satisfying and interesting, with a collective being forced to judge itself in order to judge another. But I feel like the change we believe happened, didn't really have that much of an effect. Since the system itself says it can't correctly judge collectives yet, and we know the system can freely tweak numbers to suit its needs.

Seemed to largely be in the same vein as Psycho-Pass 2 in that aspect. It greatly disappoints me, and makes me wonder if they will ever make another Psycho-Pass that stands up to that of the original.\n\n__Music, Art, Sound__\n\nAll of these are just as amazing as you would expect to find in Psycho-Pass, and never once did I have any complaints. The music all fitted the universe just fine, and did a great job. Meanwhile the sound effects where hard hitting, and helped to give more power to action scenes. Art throughout the movie was great, with a ton of detail being put into what you saw. With the movie dedicating a number of scenes to showing off the designs and set pieces of the world. While a conversation was taking place, or a slow portion of the movie rolled around to give some breathing room.\nNow I do want to mention the Voice Acting, and how I hated it. The English throughout the movie was horrendous, and seemed like they barely even tried. Definitely was something I would call engrish, and should have been easy to pull off. If you have a movie in which a large portion of the dialogue will be English, maybe you should find some English VA's who can do the part. \n\n__Characters__\n\nWith Psycho-Pass Movie, we don't get that many new characters who really matter. And instead spend a fair bit of time with an old friend in Kogami. \n-Kogami, who has kinda ended up as a religious type leader to a group of guerrillas, helping to support their cause and fight. A man who just wanted to find a peaceful place to settle down finds himself back in the action. It takes a fair bit of time to actually get around meeting him, but when it does it certainly has a decent impact.\n-Akane meanwhile is pretty much the same as she was in Psycho-Pass 2. Nothing much changes with her character, still maintaining the same beliefs as before. We do end up with a decent scene early on with some nice character building, at least letting us see that she does in fact have a life and friends outside of work. Though I do question why a single woman has such a massive and empty apartment. \n-The Colonel Nicholas Wong, kinda ends up just being a generic evil guy.

He doesn't seem to really have any moral compass of any type, and could be replaced by anybody really.\n-I'm going to just group the mercenaries together, cause we never learn anything about them really. They get paid by the Colonel to do a job, and that it what they attempt to do. Spec Ops of some kind, ruthless in executing their plans and getting the job done. Though they also don't seem to be all that loyal to the Colonel, willing to change plans to suit them\n-Chuan Han, or otherwise known as the Sibyl System in this movie. A man used as a figure head to get the Sibyl System in place, and is fully replaceable and unnecessary once that goal has been achieved. \n\n__Story__\n\nA decent fast paced story, that asked a simple question really. How could the Sibyl System be introduced to a country in the middle of a civil war. And if it forcing the Sibyl System on the people to achieve peace, is worth giving up freedom. Or if the people should still be able to have a free democracy. By the end though, it feels as if the choice has already been made for the people. The Sibyl System is in place and staying, even if the people choose something different in the elections. \nMeanwhile, I question how the Sibyl System to capable of taking on such responsibilities at all by this point. It seems like the system has always been under pressure due to the amount of people it is supporting in Japan. Just seems like adding hundreds of thousands, or even millions of more people would have the system collapsing under the stress. \nBut overall, the story does a good job for the time provided. It does a good job at introducing conflict, and giving the characters motivations. Even if I feel like the story didn't really progress the world or characters very much, but just kinda filled out the world.

However, it suffers from its blistering pace causing it to miss out on character development and fall flat with its attempts at humor. Your enjoyment hinges on how well you can tolerate its flaws, and while I'd argue that this anime has more good than bad it does straddle the line quite hard.\n\n#Review in full:\n\nLet's start with the good. Black Bullet's most frequent quality is its steady (but not overbearing) action scenes. The show does a good job of making action intense and brings out some of its best animation and music for these scenes. The fights felt varied from each other as a wide variety of battlegrounds, circumstances, and opponents (both human and Gastrea, the antagonist monsters of the show) prevented even repeating rematches from feeling repetitive. There are a few fights that feel like they were cut short to prevent important characters from dying though. Still, solid overall. The other strong point of Black Bullet are its emotional scenes, which are pulled off beautifully thanks to how the show uses its setting.\n\nWhile others have criticized the setting because it doesn't convey a sense of imminent human extinction, I would argue that this was never meant to be the case. Humanity clearly suffered a heavy blow in years past, but the discovery and usage of the fictional metal \"Varanium\" is shown to have protected humanity and allowed it to get back on its feet. This is made bluntly clear by the fact that the \"wall\" protecting Tokyo is just an array of Varanium obelisks. Armed with the Gastreas' kryptonite, it's reasonable to believe that the remaining human enclaves (of which there are implied to be many in Japan alone) could exist as futuristic city states similar to Singapore in form and function (which in loose terms is what the setting is).\n\n~~~img500(http://i.imgur.com/MbVdnuV.jpg)~~~~~~_See?  Totally impenetrable._~~~\n\nThat said humanity is still fighting the Gastrea, and it turns out that people who are infected with the Gastrea virus before birth (and survive) develop Gastrea-like abilities during their brief lives. This is the point that Black Bullet focuses much of its serious moments on; in a world where the main group fighting humanity's enemy are a bunch of child soldiers imbued with the genetic code of that same enemy, what happens when these children are inevitably distrusted & despised for their similarity to the enemy? When they are no longer seen as children but as weapons of war? How does this affect them and their worldview? Is it right, or fair? Black Bullet is just as much about a war between humans and alien-like monsters as it is about main characters Rentaro and Enju as they struggle to find meaningful answers to such questions. This turns what would have been merely a jaded & serious (but otherwise generic) teenage action hero and an energetic young girl into surprisingly appreciable characters and solid main leads.\n\nThe reason I say \"surprisingly\" is because plot-wise Black Bullet took a lot of shots and not all of them hit, with many of the misses being jokes and rushed plot elements. Black Bullet's touching moments are hits in this regard, and the serious scenes all hit hard. Expect many doses of emotion from this show. Everything is held together by the great soundtrack that feels right at home with the setting, plot, and whatever is currently happening on screen. It's even worth checking out on its own. The animation has both good and bad moments, but tends to be good on average. The CG is really hit or miss and is not infrequent.\n\n\n\nNow for the not-so good. Black Bullet's main flaw is that its pacing is simply too fast. While this partially lends to the steady flow of its action it also pushes much of its humor flat on its face, stunts character development, and affects believability by skipping explanations. That's really it, but I'll go in depth for those wondering exactly what this affects.\n\nAnyways, most of the jokes are centered around the loli characters and how Rentaro does a great job of (unintentionally) making a lot of them develop crushes on him. Not all of these jokes are inherently bad but the quick pacing means that these jokes often come shortly after serious scenes. I had to stop at least once when a touching scene was bulldozed by a poorly placed joke just to be forgotten by all characters involved. On the other hand there isn't much fanservice outside of these jokes (and these jokes aren't frequent either) leaving things balanced to those who can get past them.\n\n~~~img500(http://i.imgur.com/0Xx6JI3.png)~~~~~~_What better way to introduce a child soldier with a terminal disease?_~~~\n\nIt does lead to another one of Black Bullet's flaws though; character development outside of the main duo is quite low and many backstories are explained in seconds. This isn't helped by how oblivious most of them are to the joke scenes. Instead of making you think \"oh, so that scene wasn't serious\" they'll often make you think \"wow, that character is an idiot\" thanks to this combination. Even worse is the fact that many of them are implied to have super-human abilities (a rather common thing in Black Bullet, even outside of the child soldiers) but many characters don't so much as have their abilities discussed (with even less having their abilities explained well). It does come off as the sort of thing that is usually left to the viewers to fill in the blanks, but given how often these super-powers are relied on it does tug at the story's believability when so little of it is explained.\n\nLastly, the plot is rushed at points (especially during the last arc). Many plot elements are given little to no explanation and there's a few lampshades to be had. Sadly it all falls back to a lack of backstory for most of the characters, as most of these plot elements involve specific side characters that receive far less attention than their importance to the plot warrants. This affects the ending as well since it takes the time to set up for a continuation that seems quite unlikely at this point. At the very least the main plot points are resolved and the final scene is well done.\n\n# Verdict:\nBlack Bullet might have its problems, and many of them are glaring, but the things it does right are quite great. Its problems keep it from being easily recommendable though. It's the sort of show that you watch when you have nothing else planned at the moment, and only because you had a sudden urge to try it out. Then again pacing is really its biggest issue, so if you can get past that you shouldn't have much trouble finding something worthwhile here."}, {"id": 2712, "score": 60, "body": "When you watch some anime and you look at the cover, the synopsis and think, \"Well, this looks promising. I wanna try this one.\" All of that is just the first impression at the beginning of the episode and the rest of all are just a boredom that you have to push yourself or consider that to immediately drop the anime. Well, in a nutshell, \"Trickster: Edogawa Ranpo\" Shounen Tanteidan\" yori\" is an anime that falls into the category, an anime which I've put this in my ash and start to watch it when I last saw and found it dusty. This is not an action with psychological, thriller, or shounen that has been mainstream in pop culture but this is nothing more than an anime which fails in terms of storytelling and enjoyment. It's just a bunch of teenage kids who are playing as a spy like spy kids. Nothing else to be compared to some of your favorite.\n\nThe story consists of three phases: the pledge, the turn, and the prestige but nothing without a goal for the prestige. This is not Christopher Nolan's stuff or anything that relates to him but the narrative style is pretty similar to that but fails at the prestige. First of all, the story focuses more on Yoshio Kobayashi, someone without identity, a past, a friend who have mysterious powers when approaching something or touching someone it will hurt. The story will walk, walk, and walk away until it meets with one of the supporting character's Kensuke Hanasaki, a member of boy's detective club formed by Kogorou Akechi. When they were both meets, Hanasaki promised that one day he would kill Kobayashi just as Kobayashi wanted to eagerly in demand but eager to die. The beginning of the story seemed like a filler from a collection of detective stories that trying to complete the mission given by their client to the turn, we'll be introduced by the antagonist called \"the twenty faces\" who for no apparent reason want to play with Akechi. It's not a plot holes because the story will run continuously until it will explain the background of each character. The prestige fails miserably when the story wants to build the tension and provides a bit of suspense and twist at the climax. But we never know what happens next. Spoiler alert, is Nakamura captured or not? Did Akechi and the twenty faces die or just disappear? Why doesn't anyone care about them when before the climax focuses more on these two characters that run from the main story? No one knows because this is what makes everything is torn and there will never be the prestige and conclusion.\n\nNothing I could just say with the art because it doesn't look unique or there is something great in my eyes. However, it's also an irony when two big studios that made Amaama to Inazuma and D.Gray-man have no intention of working on this one anime. There is no intention at all to put a lot of effort or feeling to do this thing. Can't they make an anime like that or are they just being driven to do it? There's nothing more I can say for the art, visuals, and animation because nothing can interest me anymore.\n\nFor the soundtrack, I'm going to give a little great review on this aspect because GACKT exists in this anime. \"Kimi dake no Boku de Iru kara\" and \"Tsumi no Keishou: Original Sin\" are not too memorable but is great because it's rock. \"Unmei Dilemma\" and \"1HOPE SNIPER\" by Azusa Tadokoro are either same. GACKT also fills the voice of the twenty face. It's put a great expectation but not too memorable, along with other seiyuu. Daisuke Ono as Kogorou Akechi looks promising but doesn't show too much like the characters he's filled in. Azusa Tadokoro also, in addition to singing the opening and ending songs, she also fills the voice of Nao Nakamura but I don't need any review from the seiyuu.\n\nThe characters are just beyond too far when it comes to the development. Everything is just a good impression on the introduction at the beginning, the pledge. Kobayashi, Hanasaki, Akechi, the twenty faces, Inoue, all look reliable at the beginning. However, this anime always deviates from the main story. You can say that the beginning of the story focuses on the relationship between Kobayashi and Hanasaki. However, the main focus always runs and moves from one character to another. At the turn, the story will focus more on Akechi, the twenty faces, and their past until later, the author will drop the twist bomb that's not too shocking. The development characters are the worst of all. You can see when watching this anime until the end, the characters are always out of characters and it have bad scripts. As in the relationship between Kobayashi and Hanasaki are forgotten in the middle of the story when they both promise a thing. It's just beyond my expectation where I'm more expecting something like Kyoukai no Kanata, has the same premise about two main characters that are continuous but the anime can still be seen from the other side. It's not like this anime that forgets everything.\n\nThe pace is bad which means it's so hard to keep it up with the story, the characters, and everything. To be honest, the first impression is just promising at the pledge to the turn phase where everything slowly begins to disappear and lose the sensation of being able to overcome your anxiety. Nothing interest in the conversation, the characters who always disregard their respective roles, and two studios that failed to attract any attention. My rant is not too enough to put away this thing but I just feel pity for them and me. Nope, I didn't feel like that.\n\nTrickster is one of the anime that had a good impression at the beginning but failed in the middle until the end. It's weird when my review of this anime I used three stages from Christopher Nolan's or Christopher Priest's The Prestige. But, it looks like it does and this anime fails to tell the way it does. The plot twist is too sassy, the characters which are always out of character and lost their role, two big studios that make a mediocre animation, have a bad pace, and the characters development is also so bad. There's nothing more I can say about Trickster but it's not as bad compared to Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni. Both of them has the same level of what something bad always worse."}, {"id": 2713, "score": 50, "body": "_This review was taken from my reviews blog, [link to the original here](https://haxoscript.wordpress.com/2018/07/04/review-mahoutsukai-no-yome/)_\n\nI was really excited for this anime. I really wanted to love it. But there's a limit at the amount of bad elements that you can ignore. While the premise was very interesting, it failed to deliver any expectations that I could have.\n\n__Story__: _The Ancient Magus' Bride_ tells us a story about a girl named Chise who, after living a life of abandon, gets adopted by a mysterious mage called Elias. The story will be about that pair getting closer to each other while discovering all the magic elements that exist in their world.\n\n__Plot__: That's one of the points that fails the most. I admit it, the first half of the story (ep. 1-12) was great, as it presents more interesting  characters that will stay with the main ones, tells us about the rules of that world, and bases the conflicts that the story will have to resolve. But then the second part arrives, and for some reason it proceeds to ignore all what they build in the first part. The pacing gets messed up, those episodes get repetitive, in them they try to resolve conflicts that apparently were already solved, and it just throws the characters into trivial situations that won't matter for the plot, the character building, or the message. And in the end, the most important conflicts get suddenly resolved without previous building for it. Another point is the \"funny moments\", they constantly make little scenes with the characters looking chibi and saying something funny in an attempt to make some comedy, and sometimes it works, but on other occasions they just insert them in the middle of a serious situation and it just breaks the mood.\n\n__Characters__: Another aspect where it fails miserably. If i had to define all the characters with one word, it would be _inconsistent_. The main characters act differently from one situation to another, and this just ruins all the building they could have. Additionaly, some of the most misterious characters' past or motivations are never revealed, so at the end they seem lackluster. Regarding the side characters, they're used in a terrible way. Major part of them just show up for one episode and won't be seen again for a long time, and when they appear again they have a trivial role on the conflict. And yes, some of them are an attempt to develop the main characters, but it's worthless if that development is continuously ignored.\n\n__Visuals__: The best aspect of the show. The artstyle, the colors and the animation are truly beautiful. Wonderful landscapes, original looking character designs, and effects that really makes the world look \"magic\".\n\n__Sound__: Another good aspect. The first opening is excellent, and a few tracks are really great and they improve those \"magic\" moments along with the great art. The rest is forgettable but it does its job.\n\nAt the end, this show tries to make several points without reaching any of them. If you decide to watch this show, do it for the visual aspect, because regarding the plot and characters it leaves a lot to desire.\n\nOverall score: 5/10"}, {"id": 2718, "score": 65, "body": "_This review was taken from my reviews blog. [Link to the original here](https://haxoscript.wordpress.com/2018/07/04/review-kiznaiver/)._\n\nLong time ago, I promised myself to not watch any other show written by Mari Okada. However, when I saw that Kiznaiver was a collab with Studio Trigger, I told to myself: \"hey, maybe Trigger can do a good job here\". But no, not even Trigger could save it.\n\nWell, let's explain what's all this about.\n\n __Story__: A bunch of teenagers with opposite personalities to each other are taken as subjects of an experiment, and they're modified to share both physical and emotional pain. From now on they will have to pass some tests where their bonds will be challenged. At the same time, they will try to discover who are the people directing that experiment and why are they doing it.\n\n__Plot__: The anime is supposed to be focused on characters and their bonds with each other. However, there is barely any character development on any of them. \n\nAt this point, comparisons with Kokoro Connect are inevitable. Both share similar premises and intentions. KC decided to work around developing its characters, while leaving the supernatural part of the plot as just a way to do so. Kiznaiver ended up trying to develop its supernatural subplot, but it totally forgot to develop its characters, and at the end, in a story focused on character's bonds, the characters should've been the most important part.\n\nOf course, a big part of a story about character's bounds is the conflict, specially in that case where all characters are completely different to each other. However, those conflicts are way too overdramatic. It focuses on irrelevant stuff, rather than bigger threads. Getting rejected by your crush isn't the end of the world, but this show pictures situations like this one as if they were a huge deal, which are not.\n\nLastly, about the expriment plot... well, it's fine. It doesn't lead to any big conclusion, but it's there and it works, so I'm fine with that part.\n\n__Characters__: Insultingly underdeveloped. The main cast is supposed to be 8 characters. However, of all of them, only 3 get developed: the main character, the antagonist, and only one of the other kids. The rest are unfortunately left as one-dimensional.\n\nYes, the main character is extremely bland, but that's part of the story, so I'm fine with it. We eventually get to know the motivations and some of the backstory of the antagonist too, and while some of its points aren't clear, it's okay too, because at least it's relevant for the plot. And the third character to get developed is one of the rest of the main cast, and it's a really good development, they dedicate a few episodes to build it and the results were great. But why they did that with only one of the characters, and not with every one of them? Honestly, no idea. They showed us that they were capable to. But they didn't. Maybe it's because the show was too short and they didn't have time to do so, or maybe it's just lazy writting... anyways, the cause doesn't matter, what matters is that it's not there.\n\nOf course, bad development means meaningless interactions. Why would I give a #$@% about the interactions between one-dimensional characters? They won't learn anything, and the plot will move forward as if it never happened. They could just not be there and it wouldn't matter. Oh, and also the show tries to build a love triangle. Well, not a love triangle. More like a love hexagon, because every character falls in love with another one, who is also in love with a third one, who is in love with... okay, I'd better stop. But all this falls meaningless for the reasons I explained above, and it only contributes to the overdramatic situations that I've already complained about.\n\n__Visuals__: It's Trigger what we're talking about. Trigger is known to deliver unique and attractive designs of... well, everything, and it has not failed this time either.\n\n__Sound__: Some amazing music tracks, the opening is cool too, and a really good voiceacting.\n\n__Enjoyment__: Honestly, despite all its faults, I enjoyed this show. At the end it may leave the viewer unsatisfied because it didn't deliver to the expectations, but the good designs, the interesting story and the comedy parts make it a show that you may still have a good time with.\n\nOverall score: 6.5/10"}, {"id": 2734, "score": 68, "body": "This is a pretty good combination of the comedy genre with the aspects of RPG and adventure anime that are usually taken with a serious tone. This anime was quite refreshing in that it didn't really shove unfunny pervert jokes in your face like most anime would, instead it shoves it in your face whilst embracing that perverseness. I liked how the main character kind of subverted from the normal perverted character archetypes and had a sense of realism to him, always being doubtful of the situation. The nods to his old life do appear in this anime and it is done so pretty well, showing aspects of both his personality and decision making that mirror how he would have been as a NEET back in Japan which I do appreciate. In comparison to something like Re:Zero (disregarding the genre) who kind of completely disregards the fact that he used to be in Japan and living a normal life, only considering it when it is convenient for the plot - like when he pulled that cellphone shit. To complain more, Re:Zero literally does a flash back to him in the grocery store as an example of how he wasted his life which is complete garbage. But small pieces of flavour in KonoSuba like the fact that he treasures his tracksuit from Japan etc. allow for the character to be a bit more realised than the bullshit Subaru. Anyways, enough with that irrelevancy. Speaking of plot conveniences, this anime definitely does that as well, but I can probably dismiss it more here than I can with Re:Zero since KonoSuba needs those stupid conveniences in order for the characters to get through the shitty situations that they find themselves in (also it's a comedy so yeah \u00c2\u00af\\\\\\_(\u00e3\u0083\u0084)_/\u00c2\u00af ;). And I mean, they weren't even that bad in all consideration, since it was done in a comedic way I think I can excuse that.\n\nThe characterisation of the main cast was pretty good even though they are all stupid in their own way, that's what makes the cast that much more charming. Although each one of them could obviously fit into an archetype, it doesn't seem as forced as other anime tend to be with their archetypal characterisation. I think the dynamic between Kazuma and the others really brought this series to life for me, which was kick-started by the pretty well done character introductions and slow development of the cast. Although, I think that this series could have worked better if it did focus on the deeper development of the main cast and the main character, although I can probably excuse that also since it's a comedic anime and doesn't really need to capitalise on its pretty wide stretching (in terms of personalities and traits) cast.\nThe hardest thing I found about this anime to enjoy was most likely the art, since you could tell that it wasn't really trying to go for amazing visuals or anything of course since it's a comedy. But yeah, I can understand why the art was so simple and I started to appreciate that after a few episodes of getting used to it. Sometimes the art is pretty good but it's a bit inconsistent throughout the series, when compared to a great comedy like Nichijou (although that's not a fair comparison considering that Nichijou is a school-based anime whilst KonoSuba is an adventure based anime).\nAll things considered, this COMEDY anime did make me laugh and I appreciate that since most comedy anime that I have seen has been pretty pandering and might have tried too hard with its jokes. Of course KonoSuba does get pretty exhausting with the recurring jokes, but I do appreciate that most of the delivery was pretty good - with the characters bouncing off each other and allowing for the audience to absorb the joke and appreciate the release of the punchline. And that's why I would give this a strong 6/10. "}, {"id": 2735, "score": 65, "body": "I think that this series has a lot to love, from the fight choreography, animation and character desigs to the way the plot eventually develops into quite an engaging story. The story itself is not really that realistic, and that fact is one of its strengths, embracing the wacky and fantastical aspects of the world that come in throughout the series. What brings it downhill is probably the cohesion throughout the plot of the series right about where the plot develops its story to be a bit more complex than it seemed to be (right around the middle of the series). The specific aspect that needed more attention was the world building, which would have not only allowed for the characterst to be fully grounded in the world that the series had set up for itself, but also would have allowed for the series to have eased into the second act. Though I guess that the world building isn't necessarily important in this kind of series that's based in comedy and action, it still would have been a nicer touch to have my suspension of disbelief appealed to a bit so that I could be more invested as a whole. I'm not an expert but that's just my opinion. Other than this one issue, I enjoyed this anime as a deviation from mainstream fanservice anime, taking advantage of the fanservice and making it work in the series' favour. The art pops, the music brings the tension out and the characters make me root for the main character's success. I would say that this, as a contributor to the slice of life genre, is good in establishing a likable cast and allowing for them to develop. Even with the timeskip happening to spruce up the plot and have everything make sense, though the perspective swap did rush through the parts we already saw, character development still happens and manages to strengthen the relationship that the character has with the rest of the cast. They say that the best way to rewrite a story is to do it from a different perspective and that's exactly what this swap did for me, though it wasn't that mindblowing and the series didn't take full advantage of its different perspective, I appreciate that this original anime decided to take that unique turn. Didn't blow my mind but was a refreshing experience for the slice of life anime of the contemporary anime seasons.

Instead, what is there to guide the audience is the presumed focus of the entire series - the short-term (week) memory of Fujimiya. I think that's what this first episode strives to hook the audience with, their unique hook and I can understand why they would disregard trying to fully establish the characters as well as the kind of lives that they live. At a glance I can tell what they would probably be like but yeah, I think for shows like this they need to establish their characters soon or else the show just becomes incredibly boring. This anime does have potential to do that, in the interactions between the two main characters and I hope that it pulls through because of how seemingly interesting the plot is right now.\n\n_FULL SERIES:_\nThere are a lot of things that went wrong in this series, from the cohesiveness to the shot composition as well as how they conveyed the plot to the audience. As an audience member I felt as though this show was treating me as if I had to have everything in front of my face to know what was going on or what was going to happen, since they had to have it go through the dense minds of the characters. I felt like it was extremely predictable to know what was going to happen and to have it drag on with the confusion of the oblivious main character Hase was exhausting. This show did show promise (kind of) with how it presented the plot in the first few episodes, although that was lost quickly when everything started to jump around and conflict started happening even though the characters weren't even developed that well to make the audience care as much as the show wanted them to. This lack of cohesiveness worked its way into the individual scenes of the show with some of the shots being really hard to follow and just making it seem pretty messy (the beach episode is an example of this). The art itself was fine and so was most of the music so yeah that's not worth mentioning I guess.\nThe biggest problem was the characterization in the show, with the anime speeding in with the conflict as opposed to building their characters so that the problems would actually have some impact. I ended up not caring most of the time when conflict came up since it did so very abruptly. On that note, the tone of the show was inconsistent with it switching from slice of life to melodrama to romance between halves, which made it even more exhausting to watch. The ending also didn't feel as satisfying as it seemed to be and I felt barely any accomplishment from completing this series. I saw the potential but it didn't deliver sadly, so many arcs were pretty unnecessary, which hurts this anime drastically since it is only 12 episodes. Anyways, yeah it's probably just average.

The show tried really hard to entice the audience with that \u00e2\u0080\u0098weird girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Urabe who transferred to the school in the first episode, and it kind of put me off when I completed the first episode. Along with that it pushed the drool part of the show pretty hard to be the main hook of the series, and all of it just felt pretty forced. Despite this, I grew to enjoy the series a little bit, as I do with shojou-type shows since I got to see the progress of the couple step further with each episode. They did more with the drool thing, which was interesting and when they introduced the scissor panties that was kind of weird but other than that the characterization of the two main characters was fine as a whole. Positively, Tsubaki was very apologetic, despite being a kind of a pervert. Well, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that true, he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a pervert, I guess he was just a high school boy, so I understand that inclusion. Anyways, his constant apologies whenever he thought that he went over the line gave his character a kind of realness to him.

The music was pretty good as well, although I felt like they used the same track for the same emotions a lot, which I noticed but it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t affect my watching experience too much. The animation itself was alright, since the art style was so simple and the only time that they had to showcase it was when Urabe did her scissor panties trick. \nThe side characters were a bit weird, mainly that yuri friend character that always was being intrusive to Urabe and kind of invading her privacy though she did give her lunch and whatever. I just thought that most of her purpose in the series was to drive plot along with Urabe and Tsubaki, being the catalyst for both drama and the focus of the episode. Other than that, she was an alright character. \nThe conflict character was a bit weird though, since Tsubaki acted so on impulse so that the plot had somewhere to go. I understand why, but yeah, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure about its development. \nOverall, the anime was decent. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily love it, but I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth a 5/10 because of how hard it is to convey a relationship in the anime medium, as well as do it uniquely. This anime probably had some potential to be a little better in execution, especially with the nuances of the characterization though it did a fine job regardless."}, {"id": 2752, "score": 60, "body": "Shinya Shokudou isn't your typical run-of-the-mill gag-manga with weird drawings and even weirder characters. It's actually a metaphor for daily life, incorporating all it's hardships and joyful moments, packed tight with a bunch of characters who couldn't be more unique in their weird behaviour and tastes.\n\n__Story__\nThe story is told in an episodic style, meaning every chapter is basically a stand-alone story and can be understood without having read any prior chapters (though that may not necessarily be advised). A typical chapter consist of an introduction, in which either a certain character or meal is being indroduced, followed up by some kind of personal problem or concern that usually revolves around the characters philosophy of life and lastly: a revelation that leads to either a meal being given a new way of being served or cooked or a character adapting to a new way of life.\n\n__Art__\nThe drawings might appear a bit lackluster at first, but being honest, they are indeed decent at worst. The purpose of depicting emotions and creating atmospheres, that usually underlies manga drawings, is definitely met by the art featured in Shinya Shokudou. The wacky lines match the characters well, not only as a caricature of their personalities, but also as a way to show the uniqueness that everyone carries deep inside of them, no matter how trivial their life might appear in a bigger context.\n\n__Characters__\nThe characters are the real selling point of Shinya Shokudou. Seldom have I seen as diverse a cast as the one featured in this manga. Every new character introduced is a real treasure chest filled with weird eating habits, tastes and background stories as strange as they come. Ranging from Yakuza members to transgender couples, over Mahjong enthusiasts and japanese adult video actors and actresses, every character quickly becomes a part of the world and not rarely also finds a way into the readers heart. As we get an inside into every characters personality through some kind of story, the only story the reader doesn't get a look into, is the story behind the main character. The manga does a good job at letting the reader get a grasp of the protagonists personality only through his behaviour and his reactions.\n\n__Enjoyment__\nNot a single time was I bored while reading. More than one time did this manga make me laugh out loud and more than one time did I have to shed a tear. The balance between comedy and drama is superb and the dialogues never get boring, despite the huge amount of text sometimes displayed.\n\nAll in all, I would say this Manga is worth a read, if anything, to at least see the beauty in the daily life activities that we so often dismiss as mundane."}, {"id": 2760, "score": 60, "body": "STORY/PLOT/THOUGHTS\nI did not enjoy this show, but it had some redeeming qualities. The best way I can put it is that The Seven Deadly Sins is like a strawberry smoothie with a little mucus mixed in. Ban and Gilthunder and King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past are some of the absolute best things about this show. I enjoyed the slow development of who the big bad bosses really were and some information about Meliodas\u00e2\u0080\u0099 true origin. Fight scenes are nicely-executed as well. \n\nHowever, I was really turned off by the copious blood vomits/spit-takes (it's like the blood spews out in two forms: bite-sized nuggets and water hose pressure), Meliodas\u00e2\u0080\u0099 gropey-grabby hands (the fanservice feels icky and too contrived; sorry not sorry), and Elizabeth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s utter uselessness (I swear her personality is \u00e2\u0080\u009cbest girl\u00e2\u0080\u009d; I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care too much about moe chicks). \n\nNow, I love romance as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m always reading a good shoujo, but I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care for Elizabeth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s undying love for our golden boy. I actually preferred Ban\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thinly-developed love more even though I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand lolicon stuff. \n\nAlso, the story moved too slowly in certain episodes before picking up an exciting pace toward the 20\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. \n\nCHARACTERS\nI liked the ensemble of characters (minus Elizabeth), and the bits of development they got. Meliodas definitely wasn't the most likable character, but he wasn't one of those mc's that you beg to get off the screen for one reason or another. \n\nFor me, his companions were much cooler. Diane made me feel for her, King's previous whereabouts were interesting, and, of course, I enjoyed Ban a lot. The piggy character runs its mouth too much for me, but it fulfilled the animal sidekick role well enough.\n\nMISC: ANIMATION, VOICE ACTING\nAs far as the English dub, I thought the voices were good. I think each voice fit its character well though Elizabeth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice is sickly sweet and her crying leaves a lot to be desired. \n\nThe animation is very fluid and smooth, but some of the bodies look weirdly proportionate (i.e Griamore and Elizabeth).\n\nThe music is beautiful and empathy-inducing. It helps set the tone well for important scenes. Even by itself, the soundtrack is great.\n\nOVERALL: 6/10 | 60% | NEUTRAL SMILEY FACE :|\nIs it worth watching? For me, I would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve dropped this show much quicker if it weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for Ban and the interesting build-up to a satisfying end.

But in this case never really managed to convince me that I would be interested in the Light Novel. The show seems to end prematurely with underdeveloped characters and world. And really just needs another season to make me care about it, cause what I saw didn't do that.\n\n~~~__Characters__~~~\nThe driving point for this show should have been the characters while you grow to love and have a connection with them. But I feel like I never had time to connect with them, to the point that I really only remember 5 names total. Out of a cast of like a dozen plus people. We have Kal-el, Claire, Mitty, Ariel, and Ignacio. And that is everybody that I can actually remember from the show, so I guess none of the other characters really left any impression on me at all.\n- Kal-el - The main character of the story who grows and and learns to let go of his hate. While it works well enough, I don't feel like the show gave it enough time really and just had him switch incredibly quickly. While his romance never really was given enough time for me to get a feeling for it. Only really got a couple shots and scenes, alongside a falling in love at first sight scene. I will give it credit for not having all that many cliche scenes.\n- Claire - The female lead and main romance partner, who ends up debating the role she has been given. While also debating if she can fall in love after everything that has occurred. The romance with Kal-el works well, and avoids cliches pretty well.\n- Ariel/Ari - The sister of Kal-el, who always fights with him. They seem to want to do something of a love triangle with Ari and Claire, but never develop it. And is only really noticed in the way she acts around him cause it is never mentioned directly. Really wish she had gotten more development that was reserved just for her, and not her building Kal-el story even more. \n- Supporting Cast - Well this is were is really fell apart for me. While we get a ton of backstory and character development for Kal-el and Claire, the rest of the cast is kinda forgotten about. Their stories seem to be forgotten and pushed away so we can get more space for backstory for Kal-el and Claire. And because of this I never really develop any attachment to these characters when something happens to them. They all seem to have some romance going on between them, but at most get just a couple minutes dedicated to the relationship. Then somebody like Ignacio who plays a rather important role, has his backstory delivered in a 3 min intro and never has much more development. \nThe Supporting Cast really deserved more time dedicated to just having them on the screen, with them building character together. Cause as it is, they really are just forgotten characters that fill in space. \n\n~~~__Art & Music__~~~\nA rather weak part of the show, with poor Art and Animation alongside forgettable Music. \n- Art - Feels like many shots they just stopped half way and never finished the shot. Details just don't exist in some shots that existed just a minute ago. Definitely feels like it was done with a small budget that never had the money to make every scene look good, so decided to just try and make every scene look acceptable. Many moments in which characters and objects just feel like they were placed into the scene with no thought done about shadows, or how this object would effect the scene. Faces in scenes just kinda end up being the most basic thing possible with incredibly simplistic animations. \n- Music - I don't actually remember any of the music from the show at all. I don't remember the OP or the ED, even though I just watched it. And I don't remember any of the music playing in the background of the show, even though I seem to remember it existing. Maybe it would do a decent job in just enforcing the world more if the Art and Animation were better, but as it is, it does nothing for me at all.

Basically, this girl is really into a guy, but when she confesses to him he says she's not his type and then promptly shows her what kind of girl he likes: which is a stereotypical valley girl (or japan's version of it, anyway). She then proceeds to COMPLETELY CHANGE WHO SHE IS just so she can date him.\n\nIt works, they're happy and have a lot of sex, but... you know... that's not HER. It's that guy's version of her.\n\nSome things happen that makes her doubt his \"love\" for her and they almost break up, but then he's like \"nah, I actually like you\". And that's the end.\n\nSorry, but I'm not buying it. I'm pretty sure that he only \"started to like her\" just because she went through all those changes to please him. I really hated this story.\n\n<b><i>2) Deep Kiss - 3/5 stars</b></i>\nAll this female main character wants is romance, but because of her big boobs, guys just want to use her for sex. One day she meets a rude boy and she finds out that he's only rude to girls he doesn't like.\n\nSo she plots a plan against him: she'll seduce him, have sex with him and then dump his ass! That'll teach him a lesson!\n\nExcept, you know... she ended up liking him.\n\nThis is kind of clich\u00c3\u00a9, I know, but I actually liked it. It ended in a cute way :) plus, the sex scenes were great.\n\n<b><i>3) Magic Fingers - 1/5 star</b></i>\n\nIt seems that with this particular anthology, it's always going to be a hit or a miss. This time, it was a BIIIIG miss. The main characters are already in a relationship, but much like the girl in the first story, this girl is willing to let go of her individuality just because of her boyfriend.\n\nActually, it's worse: she explicitly says she likes how her boyfriend's \"magic fingers\" turn her into a sex toy. Umm... okay?????\n\nTo top it all off: her boyfriend gets busy with work and she gets pissed at it and demands for him to choose between his job and her. WHAT?!?!?!\n\nThis girl is crazy, desperate and not at all relatable. I think she's the worst of all the 4 girls.\n\nThe only redeemable thing about this story is that the sex is very, very hot. But to me, that's not enough to raise the rating. It was terrible nonetheless.\n\n<b><i>4) Summer Memories - 5/5 stars</b></i>\nAh, THIS is the one that I actually liked. The last girl in our anthology just broke up with her boyfriend and decided to move back to her hometown, where she meets her old friend and high school crush for the first time in ages.\n\nShe finds out he has a \"girlfriend\" and gets really sad, but still makes a move on him anyway. Things get steamy. They start to hang out in secret and oh man, they're actually SO cute together!!\n\nI actually started to root for them, even though I absolutely despise cheating. But, well... let's just say that the story \"fixes\" that problem for me, which is why I gave it a high rating ;)\n\nIt's sweet, it's hot, it's short, it's honestly the best story this anthology has to offer.\n\n\n\n\nOverall, I don't think I'd recommend this.

It's Riko's goal in life to be ordinary, but Ran's not having that!\n\nStory:\nThe basis of Riko's ordinary life gets encumbered by Ran's crazy life daily. Whatever wacky hijinks of the chapter usually revolves around two plots: 1. Assassin trying to kill/capture Ran 2. Assassin wanting Riko for himself (usually to be his bride).\n\nWith assassins as the forefront of the story, things do get somewhat serious. Large machine/military guns can be pulled out of anyone's pocket at any time though that's mostly done for a humorous effect.\n\nSN: The side stories in Hana ni Arashi are mature and deal with teenage abortion and molestation.\n\nCharacters:\nAfter a bad rejection, Riko has dedicated herself to becoming ordinary when she's anything but that. The manga called her extremely flexible, but I think that's a bad translation for \"super strong.\" This chick picked up an entire Christmas tree by herself!\n\nI liked how when it wasn't needed for the plot (this is shoujo y'know) she saved herself. She did not regularly play the damsel in distress. Riko even had to save Ran once and issue out a rescue mission. Not much of her personality was shown, but she seemed to be stoic until Ran made her open up.\n\nRan, I think, is my favorite character. He's an eccentric, billionaire bad boy with too many guns and too much fun. He falls in love with Riko at first sight and tells her at GUNPOINT she will be his bride. Although being associated with him endangers her life, he can't stay away due to liking her so much. Instead, he places tracking devices on her. \n\nHe is just unorthodox like that. He's a clingy teenager who is used to being spoiled. There could have been some hidden development in his character if we had gotten to see his mother. Unfortunately, the mangaka couldn't squeeze that in. All in all, Ran's a goofball!\n\nBaldy was a close second for my favorite. He had the best one-liners. Riko's classmates as a whole were cool. I loved how when an assassin attacked the school these idiots retaliated by throwing paper balls and WON.\n\nTachibana was confusing. I could never figure out if he was good or bad? I guess he stuck true to what most assassins believe; their allegiance is to the highest payer.\n\nRelationship:\nThe relationship was rushed. It went from Ran annoying Riko to marry him to Riko deciding he wasn't so bad to her soulmate. I guess maybe it was fate that they were together. Riko never said \"I love you,\" but it was shown in her actions. \n\nArt:\nI liked the art. Most of the characters were plain in appearance (Read: Riko and Baldy), but Ran and his father were gorgeous! They knew they had to be the eye candy with the way everyone else looked. \n\nThe only female assassin had the weirdest breasts, whenever she was in motion her side boob would stay static no matter what. I don't know if the mangaka was hinting her breast were fake or not, but it was funny. Also, I like how often Riko's eye-ware changed and the covers of the manga were excellent.\n\nOverall:\n\n[SCORE: 5/10 | 50% | NEUTRAL FACE :| ]\n\nIn conclusion, I wish the ending could have been more meaningful.

I'd only consider watching it if you're a fan of the series already, and even then it's not _really_ recommendable.  It isn't bad, but it can't be said to be as clever or whimsical as the games themselves.\n\n#Review in full:\nThis is a collection of 3 plot-independent stories involving the titular Pikmin and (to a lesser extent) Captain Olimar.  It's suggested that this takes place sometime during the events of Pikmin 2, given the types of Pikmin featured and the presence of the research pod from that game.\n\nApparently Shigeru Miyamoto came up with the idea to make these shorts to explore the game's characters in ways that would be difficult in an actual game.  Despite this Olimar isn't given any character outside of being the guy directing the Pikmin sometimes.  Aside from a couple of enemies and the research pod (who also don't do anything besides the basic role they have in the game) the only characters we're left with are the Pikmin themselves.\n\nSo the exploration is with the Pikmin, right?  You could say that, and the shorts definitely focus on them, but there isn't a whole lot of character exploration with them either.  After watching you'd be able to make a few bullet points regarding the base characteristics of the Pikmin as a whole, but hardly anything could be said about the individual types.  Their basic abilities are shown (and the white Pikmin can spit corrosive acid for some reason) but there isn't any character behind it.  A blue Pikmin could wake up as a yellow Pikmin one day and it wouldn't act any different than it had before the change, or at least we'd be led to believe that after watching this.  If building characters beyond the games was the purpose of this, then it didn't achieve its goal in the slightest.\n\n~~~img500(http://i.imgur.com/fiWRXQo.png)\n_Nintendo did, of course, take the time to explore Mario references._~~~\n\nThat being said the plots of the episodes themselves, while not amazing, are still enjoyable at a base level.  The humor is usually decent and the stories themselves generally make sense (though it's not exactly like the games).  There's even a few things that may catch you off guard.  It's still nothing worth coming back to though.  It also makes references to, specifically, Pikmin 2.  If you haven't played that game then these shorts will not resonate fully with you.\n\nThe animation and art quality is pretty good.  It's what you'd expect from something Nintendo was involved with and there's some nice touches of detail (like individual Pikmin reactions) if you look hard enough.  The music is whimsical but isn't recognizable from the games (which is a shame since they have nice music).  The sound consists of a lot of clips straight out of the games, which sometimes fits and sometimes feels low-quality compared to the rest of the presentation.\n\n#Verdict:\nIt's a standard series of computerized shorts, containing some of the quirks from the games and some oddities of its own.  Nostalgia aside it isn't really special and fails to be anything other than simple humor.  As a fan of Pikmin I could enjoy it somewhat, but I don't see a non-fan easily getting as much (or more pessimistically, as little) out of it as I did."}, {"id": 2796, "score": 68, "body": "*Note: This review will cover the full run of PriPara which includes Idol Time PriPara for a total of 191 episodes.\n\n~~~img425(https://static.zerochan.net/PriPara.full.1873285.jpg)~~~\n[_PriPara_](https://anilist.co/anime/20742), short for _Prism Paradise_, is a solid yet often overlooked idol anime. It's a spin-off of the anime [_Pretty Rhythm: Aurora Dream_](https://anilist.co/anime/10257/PrettyRhythm:AuroraDream) and is also an [arcade collectible card game](https://pripara.jp/) developed by Takara Tomy. Despite its looks, _PriPara_ is a decent idol anime. Unfortunately, its kid-friendly themes, overly cute world and relatively slow start makes it a bit harder to digest for viewers looking for a more standard idol anime. Patient viewers, however, will be gifted with a fun, nonsensical, well-rounded and whimsical story that'll leave you satisfied by the end.\n\n>\"It's not my fault I inherited your loud voice!\" \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Manaka Laala to her Mom, Episode 1\n\nThe most notable aspect that makes _PriPara_ different from the other idol anime is its setting, or perhaps better said, world. Girls, boys are not allowed*, must visit their local fashion outlet, \"Prism Stone\", where they are then transported to the holographic powered world of _PriPara_.\nThe charm of the show comes from this magical, fantasy-like world. Flying plush-like animals act as the managers for their beloved idols. Songs are apparently created out of literally thin air and served on a silver platter. A single pair of red glasses operates the entire idol system, there are many things in this anime that don't conform to real world rules. It is a truly silly world that plays by its own rules. That's not to say the show is a complete clown fiesta, well that depends on what we're talking about. It sticks to the rules that it sets and anything that is seemingly implausible is due to the \"system\". It's not a perfect world, there will be many moments where you'll just have to bite the bullet and accept what you see, but that's part of the fun.\n\nThe characters of _PriPara_ are collectively above average. There are some fantastic and lovable characters and there are some annoying ones as well. The show tries to reach out to a wide scope of fans by having a large variety of characters. Unfortunately, if you don't inherit a bias toward certain characters, their antics and personality will put a damper on your experience. Thankfully, the characters that get the most time on screen are the more favorable ones, so this isn't too much of  negative.\nOn a related note, the humor in _PriPara_ is one of its strongest points. Sometimes it's subtle and other times it's direct and in your face. There are lots of funny and wacky moments to be enjoyed despite its childish appearances.\n \n>\"Kashikoma!\" \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Manaka Laala's catchphrase\n\nThe story is not that bad and the reason why I'm writing it down here is because there's not much to talk about. It's a simple \"idols aiming for the top\" story that you'd expect from the genre. The arcs ease into one another very smoothly and upon completion, viewers do get a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction. From a purely quality standpoint, the story is a bit mediocre, and much like the setting of the show, it carries the same negatives as it does the positives. Unfortunately, the better parts of the anime comes in the latter portions. So if you've already moved on before then, it's hard to believe in the potential of the anime. To sum it up, it's an okay story told wonderfully.\n\nFinally, we get to the music and dancing. The one thing that makes an idol anime, well, an idol anime! And much like the characters, it is collectively average. There are some very good tunes that'll certainly make it into your daily playlist but there are also some songs that you'll probably be itching to fast forward through. While I do commend the show for taking the wide approach versus sticking with the traditional idol-flavored music, perhaps they could have at least made the worse ones a bit more appealing.\n_PriPara_ also uses 3D CGI to showcase its song segments and it actually looks pretty good, even taking into account when the anime came out. The performances look amazing and the character's movements are very dynamic and energetic, it's surprisingly well done. But a big point of criticism is the overabundant reuse of camera angles, or better put, lack of different camera angles. There are over 200 performances to be seen, and the only thing that differentiates one performance of the same song to another is the change in outfits. Because the same camera angles are used, it's hard to get a feeling of something new, something fresh, especially when you will be hearing the same songs more than once.\n\n>\"Idols have the power to make people happy.\" \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Manaka Laala, Episode 2\n\n_PriPara_ is a fun and unique idol anime. It'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry, it'll give you something to look forward to. But at the same time, much like the theme of this review, it'll have moments where you'll want to skip, it'll have moments where the show just comes short of providing that entertainment you were looking for. There are plenty of things to praise and there are plenty of things to criticize. Given the chance it could become your new favorite anime.

I noticed how only the male characters are \"awesome\" (like Light and L) and all the female characters are either there just because (like Light's mom and sister) or are there just to be submissive over men (like Misa and Takada).\n\nNot only that, but countless characters say sexist shit as well: the detective on early episodes saying that once his fianc\u00c3\u00a9 has kids she won't have to work anymore, some rapist guys saying that because a woman was wearing a skirt she was \"asking for it\", Light's dad saying that HE <i>WON'T LET</i> his daughter marry a policeman and that she <b>HAS TO</b> marry someone else, etc etc.\n\nNo, but really: <i>Misa's entire character only exists just so she can be \"\"\"\"\"useful\"\"\"\" to Light</i>. And then Takada, who is reintroduced to us as a strong female character who is successful at her job, is reduced to a Misa 2.0 as soon as Light gets to talk to her.\n\nNo women in this anime are relevant.

It would have been an interesting ending, it would have spared us from the mess that part 2 was, it would have given the audience a different kind of message (not \"better\" than the one we actually got, just a different one).\n\nSo. Is it an interesting watch? it is, can't deny that. I enjoyed some parts of the show. But it isn't \"the best anime ever\", as I've seen many people call it.

Or, at least, it is until the last quarter of the series. From that point on the Mud Whale's inhabitants are picking up the pieces, except also there's internal strife, and we still see the villainous Empire talking about how they're going to go back and fight the Mud Whale again. Except they don't, because there isn't enough time for them to actually do that before the series ends. A lot of this could have been fixed by moving some of the events around, so that instead of what feels like the big ending climax happening in episode nine, it actually happens at the end of the series. Instead of ending with a bang, Children of the Whales ends with an unfocused whimper of \"read the manga if you want to know what happens next, I guess.\"\n\nimg(https://i.imgur.com/hHaHroH.jpg)\n\nThe issues with the plot would be easier to forgive if it was backed up by strong characters. Unfortunately, Children of the Whales falls flat in this department as well. Chakuro isn't especially interesting; he is mainly around for most of the important events because the plot demands it due to his job as the village archivist because the story is vaguely framed as being told from his records. Ouni, who is part of a gang of troublemakers on the island and considered one of its most powerful Thymia users, also doesn't get much character development for the amount of screen time he gets. One of the worst offenders is Lykos, the girl from the ruined island, who is less of a character and more of a walking plot device who is there to get the story from point A to point B no matter how contradictory her actions may be. A lot of the problems with the plot could be fixed if she had any defining character traits, so it's a real disappointment that her character falls so flat. The most entertaining characters are mainly the villains, especially Liontari who livens up any scene he's in with his over the top, scenery-chewing personality. He also comes the closest of any of the characters to having an interesting back story.\n\nFor all of its faults, I still can't completely disregard Chlidren of the Whales. If you go into it not expecting much except for a lot of pretty visuals and an enjoyable soundtrack (the [ending theme](https://youtu.be/-30CSRr6wXA) in particular is beautiful, and it's a shame Netflix kept trying to make me skip it) then you may still find something to enjoy in this flawed yet unique series. Just don't expect an enthralling story that will stay with you long after watching."}, {"id": 2801, "score": 50, "body": "Hinamatsuri is a somewhat enjoyable show that I feel should have been better than it is. When looking for shows to follow for the spring season it stood out to me, and from asking around I heard that the manga it was based on was well liked. Being a fan of comedies, I decided to check it out. The first episode was a rocky start that didn't manage to draw me in all that much, but I persisted, and found that it got better over time, but that it didn't ever manage to become anything out of the ordinary.\n\nOne part of the show that really manages to stand out is the production. The animation ranges from competent to great, and I never felt that it was lacking. The art style itself is good and works well for comedic purposes, with strong facial expressions often being used to enhance the humor. While I didn't pay much attention to the editing or music of the show, it never stood out as poor to me. Content aside, the show is clearly well crafted, with a lot of effort put into it.\n\nThe story takes place in Tokyo, where the yakuza member Nitta suddenly has a young telepathic girl, Hina, appear in his apartment without warning. After a bit of tomfoolery, he ends up taking her in as his adoptive daughter, as she has nowhere else to go. Later on, a girl named Anzu arrives with the mission of taking Hina back home, but ends up failing, leaving her stranded in Tokyo without a home. \n\nAs the show goes on a few more recurring characters are introduced, consisting mainly of Hina's new classmates, Nitta's associates, and a group of homeless people that Anzu ends up staying with. Most of the cast is forgettable, with the exception of Nitta and Hina, who work very well together, and the majority of the laughs that I got out of the shows came from either Nitta or from Hina played off of Nitta. Nitta's city-slicker style and yakuza attitude put against Hina's very simple-minded view on life lays a foundation for some great moments. The show however decides to spend a lot of its time on other characters without any real entertainment value to them.\n\nA surprisingly large portion of the show is spent on Anzu's life as a vagrant and Hina's school life, neither of which are very giving. For Anzu, the show does its best to try to make you feel bad for how lousy her life is in a very limp effort, with a bigger focus on her tragedy than on any comedy. Parts of her story brought a smile to my face, but a lot of it just felt quite dull. I don't have anything against dramatic or sad shows, but when it's as tiresome and unrelatable as it is here it just became a drag. As for Hina's school life, most of the focus is put on her classmates, with Hina just occasionally butting in to mention that she likes food. To the shows detriment, most of her classmates are nothing more than cardboard, with the exception of Hitomi. Hitomi ends up accidentally working as a bartender in an early episode, and the only real humor she has from that point on is that she's a child doing things that adults are supposed to do, which sometimes works well and sometimes doesn't.\n\nWhile a lot of the show is spent on either lifeless tragedy or lackluster humor, that's not to say that it doesn't occasionally shine. Nitta is the comedic highlight of the show, and there are some _very_ funny moments involving him. There is also a very heartwarming sequence near the end of the series about Anzu, which again involves Nitta. With the parts involving him being so strong, it's a great shame that they're not really the main focus, with much of the show only having him as a side character. The emotional core the show is trying to have could have been greatly improved by showing him bond more with Hina, but the show just doesn't spend enough time on it and suffers from how much Nitta is absent.\n\nThe show was, in my opinion, decent enough for concurrent seasonal watching, but I would not recommend anyone to go out of their way to watch it now that the season is over."}, {"id": 2806, "score": 50, "body": "Seeing that this anime is full of rare visuals, a pretty crazy and dynamic animation, pretty stylized and great designs and even that at the writing level touches enough interesting topics like existentialism, what do you think is the production house that made this anime? All those colorful backgrounds and psychodelic scenes could make you think it's from [Shaft](https://anilist.co/studio/44/Shaft) and you'd be wrong. You might think that because of \"existentialist\" and \"have a crazy animation\" is maded by [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/Gainax) and again you would be wrong. Otherwise, you might think that because it is so experimental, at least it would be from [Production IG](https://anilist.co/studio/10/Production-IG) or from [Studio 4\u00c2\u00b0C](https://anilist.co/studio/13/Studio-4C), but surprise!, it's an anime from [Toei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/18/Toei-Animation), yes, the same studio that has precarious animations on many occasions, never uses hooks strange visuals and that at the level of writing only produces basic things, but hey, failing that, people simply underestimate how varied and extensive the Toei Animation catalog is. However, there are three versions of this series, of which only the last version of 2013 counts (this), because the others are quite similar, shorter and, basically, they are like pilots of the last one.\n\nWhen I found this series, I was recommended as an alternative to [FLCL](https://anilist.co/anime/227/FLCL/) (Strange, colorful, interesting), it makes sense to see it as such superficially, and yet this is far from reality. Kyousougiga is one of those animes that sincerely frustrates me its only existence, it's just that its style is so cool, it has such good ideas and it has such a good production that it hurts me that nothing has been done with it, I mean, for example, I already mentioned that many compare it with FLCL because of its crazy style, and yet, FLCL was being quite visual when it came to explaining the context of situations... Kyousougiga doesn't do this: time to get ready for a very boring and confusing first episode, that basically consists of all the exposition of everything you need to know about the world. It's basically a first episode explaining with bad exposure everything that is particular to this scenario, to continue with nine episodes of random slice of life. How the fuck can you fuck something this way? For example, some of the rules is that _\"No one can die and nothing can be broken, and images can become alternate realities\"_. Just imagine everything you can do with this!\n\nThe series, as I said, expands to issues such as religion or existentialism, but it is all more about immersive dialogue than about the plot. Anime is essentially a slife of life and, again, this is what frustrates me: having so many wonderful ideas as a new magical feudal Japan with these strange rules and colorful characters, one just doesn't make a slife of life with this! Ok, even being a slife of life, the series could be much better, could be a [Tatami Galaxy](https://anilist.co/anime/7785/Yojouhan-Shinwa-Taikei/), constantly dealing with philosophical issues in comical situations with a solid conclusion and character development. It could be at least a [Little Witch Academia](https://anilist.co/anime/14349/Little-Witch-Academia/), but none of this happened, it's even a shame that having a lot of characters is barely memorable to the protagonist, it's not even that kind of slife of life that expands details to several characters as Adventure Time does, because the series only have 10 episodes.\n\nI'm not going to lie, despite everything I've said, it's an entertaining look. Several things happen in the chapters, the problem is that the lack of plot causes nothing to have permanent effects, a progress or a construction, which makes me give a 5/10, because stays in a halfway stuck.

I understand this is derived from a manga franchise, but as a standalone it's lacking. First, I don't connect to any of the characters because they are so flat. Saizou is the typical angsty, loner archetype while Isanami is the perky, clingy priestess girl. Cool. Let's actually build on that and not leave them flatter than a steamrolled pancake. I will give some slack because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably hard to convey characters well in twelve episodes.\n\nThe episodes play out a bit like the monster-of-the-week format, but there's some decent plot development toward the end of the 12-episode run. Still, I find myself often asking \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy is this person fighting that person?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAlso, I did like the actual significance of the Brave 10 a lot. It would have been too easy to assign clich\u00c3\u00a9 roles to the characters. Ah, but darkness is not who you think it is. *wink*\n\nCHARACTERS:\nThe way this show goes about introducing characters leaves a bit to be desired. \n\nOur main character, Saizou, is an ex-ninja who is afraid to fight for someone. The ninja world has left him jaded, so he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something like a ronin. He was okay, but not much beyond \"cool\u00e2\u0080\u009d and a bit hotheaded.\n\nIsanami is bland, very bland like delicious syrup on hotdog bread instead of french toast. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like a shoujo lead because she gets kidnapped a lot, loves the first boy she sees, and wishes her breast were bigger. For some reason, even though there is no real development, I like her and Saizou together. Sometimes, I like clich\u00c3\u00a9 love. Still, I never felt a sense of urgency for her troubles.\n\nYukimura, I did not really get. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more to him than what meets the eyes, but I just did not really care. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great leader, fighter, and an all-around funny guy. \n\nBenmaru is a grating brat. Take your firebombs and go home, kid!\n\nAnatasia, who is super busty strictly for fanservice reasons, is one of the most interesting characters. Her backstory is over-the-top, but she was somewhat cool. If there had been more episodes, I would have like to see more of her story instead of it being condensed in flashbacks.\n\nKamanosuke is annoying but very much wants to be loved.\n\nI liked Sasuke a lot. He is shy, a forest boy, and an animal-lover. A little cinnamon-roll\n\nJinpachi, I know too little about. He likes alcohol and women, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got some nice dreads. Pretty handsome for a pirate!\n\nART:\nThe animation is so fluid that there aren't any wacky in-between shots. The fight scenes are cool but uncomfortably short and erratic. The characters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 designs are not to my liking, but the art style is great. I wish some of the color schemes were more imaginative. I think the characters could have undergone one more draft to fine-tune the designs. Still, I'm not complaining because I like Brave 10's art.\n\nSOUND:\n[Japanese Dub]\nIsanami's voice is annoying. The End.\n\nOVERALL:\n\n[SCORE: 5/10 | 50% | Neutral Face :| ]\n\nDid I like watching this show? Yeah, I did! But I had some disappointment such as how anticlimactic the final showdown was. I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t familiar with Brave 10 before this, so that might have left me a bit biased.\n\nIf you can put up with \u00e2\u0080\u009cSAIZOU!\u00e2\u0080\u009d an infinite amount of times, and a story focused more on visuals than plot, then this show is for you!"}, {"id": 2812, "score": 58, "body": "When Devil's Line started airing, I definitely _wanted_ to like it, but as it continued, it got harder and harder to make excuses for how mediocre it ended up. At first, watching Devil's Line felt kind of like a guilty pleasure, you know the kind you get when you're enjoying Twilight or something similar, but the pleasure bit faded as the show continued came to a conclusion. There were times that I considered dropping it, but I'm glad that I didn't. It wasn't that Devil's Line was terrible, it was just that it was inconsistently good. More on what I mean in a minute.\n\nTechnically speaking, Devil's Line was a bit of a mixed bag. Sometimes the animation was pretty solid, but other times, it was really choppy. I would love to say that the choppy bits were few and far between, but in reality, it was pretty consistent. That being said, it seemed to be isolated to mostly the beginning of the series, but it could be that I just got used to it's choppiness. The sound was strange too, especially when the someone went full \"Devil Mode\". I get what they were trying to accomplish with their sound mixing in those segments, but it ended up being less creepy in the way that they wanted and more creepy in an amusing way. However, the sound isn't all bad, most of the music was pretty good, especially the ending, which kept me going for a couple of those weird episodes towards the end.\n\nI'd be lying if I said that I didn't enjoy the premise of Devil's Line, especially since that's what drew me to it anyway. In fact, the themes of racism and segregation between Devil's and humans were the most interesting parts of the show. Unfortunately, those interesting themes got pushed to the side for a mediocre love story for most of the run-time. Not to say that Tsukasa and Anzai's dynamic wasn't interesting at first, but it got shallow and generic pretty quickly.\n\nOne of the major problems Devil's Line fell into had more to do with its overwhelming cast of side characters. And by that, I don't mean that there were countless side characters, but more that they were indistinguishable. Most of the designs were generic and they're referred to by name most of the time, which makes it extremely confusing, since you don't have a clear face to put with the name. Every time a side character's name was mentioned, I would struggle for a few minutes to figure out who they were talking about. Maybe I'm exaggerating this issue, but it certainly felt like they weren't doing a good job at making the designs unique enough to stand out, especially the police force characters.\n\nI think that illustrates Devil's Line's inconsistencies well enough, and I haven't even touched on the story at all. I won't go into detail, but I'll say that it's the same as everything else in this show, inconsistently good, with quite a bit of bad. I wouldn't _not_ recommend Devil's Line, but I would definitely not tell anyone that it's a masterpiece.

Instead of taking everything in negative and pessimistic way, we should always look at the other picture even though reality is always bitter: portrayed from the character of Anzu that even though she is a child she has to go through so many things in order to just live through the day but she does not give up, rather does her best in whatever things she could do. She does not give up on living despite having harsh life and seeing the luxuries of others like Hitomi her only thought on buying the game was to make friends with her. She has been contrasted with Hina by Nitta on various accounts and has been regarded as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cideal daughter\u00e2\u0080\u009d for a father. She is considerate about the lives she associates herself with first the homeless individuals and then the Chinese with whom she abodes. \nimg220(https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire4/529103496395ff9780907bf829f75e8a1526522412_full.png) img220(http://lostinanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Hinamatsuri-10-42.jpg)\n\nThe importance of society as a good and productive one is also portrayed in the anime through the involvement of the bartender and the customers when Nitta was going to abandon Hina but they showed him that he was the one doing the wrong because Hina is just a girl but Nitta did not plan to abandon Hina from the very start, he just wanted to give her a lesson that her destruction cannot go on for long. There were some changes in the character of Hina as well which were notified by the agent that came to earth to survey. She did not expect Hina and she turned out to be a very different person from the one she knew as she would just explode things and destroy stuff in anger but here on earth she was more controlled and calm. She also revealed her true powers when she saw others in danger though her friends had difficulty in believing her. \n\nThe ability to use the talent no matter how young the children are is also visualized in the anime through the character of Hitomi chan that even though she is so young her talent has been recognized and she has been allowed to be bartender even it is by coercion but it really cracks me sometimes when Hitomi chan is so pro at dealing with the customers that she excel even the owner of the bar. The owner sulks over her own worries to Hitomi chan. That part was the favourite among all of them. Skill does not require the age of the individual to be considered have been shown through the character of Hitomi as she is the desired candidate of various distinguished posts with whom she came in contact with because of her hard work and efficiency. Her mother doubted her at first but seeing how she end up making all the connections made her realize the adroitness of her daughter. She is also tolerant and understanding character as she, instead of being stubborn and feel bad about her co-workers, she decides to provide one of her co-worker with the thing she wanted in order to show that Hitomi desires a good relation with them rather than on bad terms with each other. Hitomi earns a lot of money working at a bar but she never shows it to her friend Anzu because Anzu is financially weak as compared to Hitomi. Hitomi is attentive to the needs of others and does not let Anzu dwell on the financial gap by praising and getting shocked each time Anzu displays her items whether it be money or things. \nimg220(http://livedoor.blogimg.jp/ninelives69/imgs/2/d/2db2a04f-s.jpg)\nNitta has the most unique behaviour that could be expected from a yakuza. The episode where the journalist interviewed and recorded his life as a result of the infamous incident of defeating the whole of the other party in order to make them famous ended up in failure. The journalist had to edit the whole interview in order to make Nitta the bad guy and it was so funny how his higher-ups and how Hina made fun of him later on. The higher-up yakuza even memorized his lines and recorded the show which also depicts that they knew how Nitta was and they did not believe in fake news and made-up interviews on TV devised to make their own channels famous exploiting the images of other people. \nimg220(https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nwQmtTCTkv4/WyUHabmCFYI/AAAAAAAAZQ0/YDCyws4kVtcwPbJWHreEEmb1OCPnw95RQCLcBGAs/s640/CollageMaker_20180616_195932080.jpg)\nThe very fact that Nitta was taking care of Hina made him distinguished. The group where he belongs also had the distinctiveness as the head of the group angered when he was told that Nitta did not consider Hina as his daughter which in turn showed the solicitous nature of the whole yakuza. Nitta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sister was more of a yakuza than he was. He is on good terms with his family and a really good cook as his mother and sister always awaits his cooking whenever he returns home. The other members of the group are funny and full of life as well which is depicted from the character of Sabu when he recommends Anzu to do bidding when she was short of money to buy hot spring tickets for her caretakers. The way he faced away when he had to tackle with sulking Anzu who lost all her money and was later on confronted by Hitomi and given a solution was hilarious on the part of Sabu while it also shows the decisive personality of Hitomi.  \n\nOverall the comic element in the anime along with dealing with serious issues makes this anime one of the best anime to be recommended as it makes you smile and laugh at various times in its own way by keeping the seriousness of the situation. It gives us some lessons of life to take care of the people in your circumvent and considering their feelings.

It could have been a Barbie film and I wouldn't be as disappointed as I am right now. \n\n[Sorry for my bad english! It's just my opinion of this anime and I guess this is one of the opinions not everyone really supports, but if this was an anime which made you happy, then that's fine! For me, it wasn't.]\n\nFirst of all, let's get to the good points of this anime.\n- beautiful art and animation (between photos of cute stones, cherry blossom trees and night star skies and Teresa's cute design with her beautiful eyes everything seemed really great and I couldn't complain about the art at all. I'm a simple person. If I see a cute anime girl, then I like it.)\n- catchy opening (I really liked the opening and the catchy music! I didn't really pay attention to the soundtracks, maybe because it did fit these situations and I could just... feel it, you know?)\n- realistic characters (of course, there are some exceptions, but hey... it's still an anime and I accept it. I really liked Tada's personality though. He's one of the few male main characters I really like because he seemed really realistic. Teresa is just a sweetheart and a good person, I couldn't complain about that. Alec... well... I liked her. I really liked her but... we didn't really see anything from her besides her protecting Teresa and almost hurting Ijuuin for his comments. It kinda disappointed me because I wanted to know WHY actually she was friends with Teresa. Did she have connections with her family? (Not sure if this was in the anime or not.. maybe I forgot? Or they explained in the manga? Not sure about that fact.))\n\nNow let's get to the last minute of the anime, which disappointed me... so so hard. \n\nI get it that this is a romance comedy anime. I get it that in the most of these romantic animes the protagonists have to get together and everyone is happy about that. But this time, I wasn't happy about this pairing at all. \nI actually love cheesy romance stories and if Teresa wasn't a freaking princess in another country, I really would have loved this pairing. They match each other good because of his quiet personality and her sweet and outgoing personality, but... I just... can't...\nYou get me? She's a princess in _another_ country. _She has to become a queen when she's getting eighteen years old_. This was decided when she was born and it also was decided that she had to marry Charles. \nIt was planned for seventeen years but just because she spent one year in another country, she dropped all these plans (well... actually Charles dropped them but just because he noticed her love for him) and just moved to Japan, because... what? A boy? \n\nDon't get me wrong. It was actually not really surprising because we kinda knew something like this would happen after we heard that Teresa's a princess. But I had so many expectations for this anime that I just HOPED it wouldn't end this way. \nIt would have been such a realistic and GOOD anime, that I would have been moved to tears. Reality isn't that easy and you can't always claim these good things just because you want to.\nEven Pin-senpai said it after he didn't get into his favourite school and Tada agreed. But why? Why did you have to ruin such a good ending just because it's more romantic? And force that \"plot-twist\" in the last minute of the episode? \n\nI know that a forced marriage isn't really a \"happy\" ending, but damn... it would have been such a good and realistic ending. Because that is just what happens when you're a princess. You have to think about your country first and not because \"her poor heart couldn't take it.\" I'm sorry, Teresa. I know you're a good girl and I really wanted you to be happy, but that ending just ruined the anime for me. I really regret watching the last minute of the last episode. \n\nI mean it didn't even tell me what happened after they shared a kiss at the end. Did she really move to Japan? Did she just left her country even though her father told her she's the only daughter he has and she HAS to become a queen? Or is she just taking a normal guy to Luxemburg who suddenly becomes a prince? I expect these endings to happen when I'm watching Disney movies. (Or maybe it's explained in the manga? I don't know.)\n\nBut anyway... this was it. I know this isn't an opinion for everyone, but I just really wanted to say it. Maybe there are some people who share my opinion.\n\nThanks for reading! \u00e2\u0099\u00a5"}, {"id": 2825, "score": 51, "body": "There's always that one show you find that starts off excellently and you expect it to go to greater lengths and remain consistent if not become better but then that does not happen every time, partly because a show doesn't bring any originality with it and partly because it doesn't strive to make things even a little unpredictable, that is the case with Tada-kun Never Falls in Love.\n\nRight around the first and second episodes I felt it was amazing since it started off so well, showing a bright artstyle not unlike Doga Kobo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other more popular (and obviously better) anime, Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun. The characters felt cheerful and the whole anime gave you a cheerful vibe, now this vibe was obviously continued in the rest of the anime but the differing point is that it was cliched to the extreme. Don't get me wrong, cliches aren't bad, but they have to be handled properly to make the show watchable and not lazily copy over cliches and skin them with your colour and post it as your anime, this is unfortunately what Tada-kun continued to do and it certainly was heartbreaking for me to see that the show I loved in episode one became a cliche machine by the 5th episode (and I'm talking about myself here, others may have started seeing effects way earlier than me). \n\nBeing a Slice of Life meant that a concrete plot wasn't exactly on the list of priorities for any anime studio for that matter, so it comes by no surprise that this show as well didn't have one, and since this is very normal and common with most Slice of Life shows in general, I'll make this the one step I'll forgive. But what comes is the rest. One problem only, cliches.

Then this cliche will be followed\u00e2\u0080\u009d and it killed my enjoyment in the anime as compared to the first episode. And this isn't a hot springs episode thing, sudden bumps, blushes at the same words, a situation being ruined by the characters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 actions, are all examples of cliches that the show followed (forgive me for being vague, as of the time of writing I've been watching a lot of anime this season so my memory is slightly hazy). \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy is this guy focusing so much on the cliches?\u00e2\u0080\u009d you might be asking. To me, cliches were the one biggest problem the show had, if this was fixed, I doubt the show would disappoint me, but then again, improving cliches is very much easier said than done. And fixing them is important because to keep a Slice of Life fun, especially a romance, you need fresh ideas, Tada had none of that.\n\nTada-kun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s characters weren't the most unique of ones but I'll have to give credit, they were cheerful but their personalities were once again riddled by the C word (pretty sure you're as tired of reading it as I am writing it, but then again, this was the biggest problem of the show anyway). Although fans were gleefully picking out the ships right from the first episode going \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlec x Ijuuin\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the like it kinda felt a bit boring. I mean, not trying to act nitpicky but a little bit of a surprise is always welcome in a romance isn't it? \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to this anime. Although not having a surprise isn't 100% bad per se but yet again, Tada-kun didn't try to make it work. At best this can remind me that the show felt lazy. Doga Kobo tried to make something fun but a little different but didn't want to make the effort for it and got itself trapped within its own plans. Apart from the cat, every single romance in the show was horribly implemented. Tada X Teresa has got to be one of the most irritating romances I've ever seen because both of them acted so stupidly and their shyness for normal things like talking to each other (especially when they first met) has got to be a pathetic way to go about the \u00e2\u0080\u009cfalling in love\u00e2\u0080\u009d step of romances. I mean, I despise the \u00e2\u0080\u009clove at first sight\u00e2\u0080\u009d view and Tada didn't help make it better at all. Pin-head and Representative-san\u00e2\u0080\u0099s romance as well wasn't explored and was left shallow. But then again it in itself was shallow from the start. Him not knowing that his childhood friend is the idol he idolises so much? Could you be any more cliche? Before you answer that, Tada already did. Yamashita Dog and Tada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sister as well were just a one blush game as well. Coming back to Tada, his \u00e2\u0080\u009cromance\u00e2\u0080\u009d with Teresa was random, pretty much non-existent except for the last 3 episodes maybe if you don't count stupid \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh I saw you look at me and I don't know what to say\u00e2\u0080\u009d crap as \u00e2\u0080\u009clove\u00e2\u0080\u009d... I'm not saying shy romances are bad, but Tada and Teresa made them look pathetic with their random shyness. Sometimes they're super shy and the other second they're pretty much flirting?\n\nPeople went memeing around saying that the cats had the best romance but funnily enough that turned out to be very much true, until *that* happened. On the other hand the other romances felt average and not out of the box. At many times I found myself predicting what the next situation could be for the characters and when and how the blushes would happen. Perhaps the one romance I could like was of Ijuuin and our secretary Tsundere, Alec (since it is of a cliche I could say I don't have a problem with). The rest meanwhile, were\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 average like I said. It seemed as if the writers wanted to do something different, they wanted to try to make the show enjoyable in episode one, but the sad contrast in the later episode showed that they were the teenager who after getting bad grades thinks \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm going to work hard from tomorrow onwards\u00e2\u0080\u009d and right the next day get caught in their usual routine, without any thought or apology for not doing what they promised themselves they'd do.\n\n~~~img720(https://moesucks.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/tada-kun-wa-koi-wo-shinai-0242.jpg)~~~\n\nNow, this show isn't filth, far from it, it's not FranXX, but it's average, it's mediocre. Why? It doesn't ruin everything and burn everything to the ground. It is still an anime you could watch in small increments (perhaps once a week to you binge watchers who are going to watch the show after it airs). It's still an anime that can leave most with a normal face, since it's charm is still present, only drastically reduced from what it could have been, perhaps a mere shadow of itself. Is Tada-kun the show I like to call \u00e2\u0080\u009cwasted potential\u00e2\u0080\u009d? Definitely. Although it didn't go it's own way it didn't veer off into the abyss either, therefore putting it in the middle. What wasn't in the middle would be the artstyle, which I've iterated thrice here was cheerful, bright and very much like Doga Kobo. Apart from reminding me about Gekkan Shoujo, it made it's characters look cute and attractive. Be it Hinako, Teresa or Tada-kun himself, everyone looked cute, and that's not to say about the colourful backgrounds and eye-catching scenery either, those were fabulous and my favourite part about the anime. But then again, cute characters and a great artstyle don't make for a good romance.\n\nNow something that was almost decent was the voice acting. Although it felt bad in terms of the female voice actors the male actors made up for it. I can forgive the female voice acting only on the grounds that Alec and Teresa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice actors aren't as experienced in the field as the males were (but I must admit, Teresa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s high pitched voice was VERY IRRITATING) and to be honest, apart from these two, on the male side I found Ijuuin a bit irritating with his voice, I was absolutely shocked to discover that Miyano Mamoru voiced him as a result. But in the end it boils down to how much you enjoyed the show. I for one don't hate the show (NANI), it's just that I felt let down because again, I wanted the show to continue the direction it had in episode one, if it did, it would be an 8 today or maybe even a 9. But not everything goes your way. \n\nThere's always that one show that clearly shows the idea the writers had in mind in the beginning but lazy writing can turn the best of starts into an average okay-ish show AT BEST, and it's sad to say but, Tada-kun stays as an example of that. I do hope that we see some improvement in Doga Kobo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next show, but as of now, I doubt a sequel to this show could carve out something better like Nozaki-kun, although I'd love to be proven wrong. Amaze me Doga Kobo.\n\n~~~img720(http://www.allyouranime.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Tada-Never-Falls-in-Love-1a.jpg)~~~\n\nStory: 4\nAnimation: 7\nSound: 5.5\nCharacter: 4\nEnjoyment: 5\n\nOverall: 5.1"}, {"id": 2826, "score": 64, "body": "__~~~Tada Doesn't Fall in Love Review\n\u00e5\u00a4\u009a\u00e7\u0094\u00b0\u00e3\u0081\u008f\u00e3\u0082\u0093\u00e3\u0081\u00af\u00e6\u0081\u008b\u00e3\u0082\u0092\u00e3\u0081\u0097\u00e3\u0081\u00aa\u00e3\u0081\u0084~~~\n__\n\n_~~~\"Spoilers\"~~~_\n\n__Synopsis:__\nA student by the name of Mitsuyoshi Tada who likes photography stumbled across a good-looking foreign girl, who somehow manages to speak fluent Japanese and was able to allow Tada to take an incredibly beautiful shot by accident. Hence, their romance commenced.\n~~~img440(https://animersindo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Anime-Ost-Download-Opening-Ending-Tada-kun-wa-Koi-wo-Shinai.jpg)~~~\n~~~_\"Yea, thats the shot boi, so cute, my gawd\"_\n~~~\n__Story:__\nYeah, it's your typical love story where the main protagonist meets the love of his life by accident, and their only obstacle between them is one of them has a bloodline of a royal family. Damn, how original can this anime be. At first, when I heard the [director](https://anilist.co/staff/110249/Mitsue-Yamazaki) of [Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun](https://anilist.co/anime/20668/) will be directing this series, I was quite hyped for it because that series was one of my favorite comedy series of all time. Yet, this anime totally falls flat in this category. At first, I was led to believe this series would be about photography and love story, but it ends up being another high school romance drama, with little to none photography. Despite its strong first episode, the next few episodes kinda felt uneventful and flat-out tedious. \n\nThere are way too many filler episodes that are irrelevant to the plot for me to actually care about all those side characters. For example, that episode where it focuses on the cat is interesting to me, but it never really helps the story progress or anything. Another example will be their senpai, who is totally obsessed with an idol that he crazed about her 24/7, but never realizing that idol is not just her childhood friend, but is also his current club associates. Both of these stories were actually interesting enough to make a side story about, but none of them makes the main story relevant nor compelling. Even though the fillers that literally goes nowhere really sucked the enjoyment out of me, I'd still say the chemistry between two main characters makes the show much more likable than it actually is. Also, the title suck balls. \n\n__Characters:__\nLet me get this straight, almost every single one of these characters is goody two shoes and one dimensional. There is no such thing as complex in any of these characters, which is why there is not an actual conflict in this story. Let's begin with Mitsuyoshi Tada, the main protagonist of the story. He is tall, good-looking and expressionless, but deep down he is a kind-hearted person who always puts his friends over himself. Is what his typical overly excited childhood friend describes him. However, we never really seen him actually do anything that puts himself at risk in favor of others. Thus, I feel like the writers were uncertain about their own characters. \n\nWhereas his significant other, Teresa, Firstborn of House Wagner, First of Her Name, the Obvious Love Interest, Future Khaleesi of Luxembourg, Breaker of Tadazone, and the Mother of Tada's Children. In short, she's a princess. In my opinion, Teresa is probably one of the cutest characters of this season and every time she smiles it warms my frozen heart. Although, with her complicating background, she is as generic as the writer wants her to be! She is outgoing, adventurous, ambitious, amiable, sympathetic and she's so damn cute. \n\nSo what I'm trying to say here is that there is absolutely no question how this series is going to end. Still, there are some aspects between their relationships I liked, the parts where they teach and understand each other is the strongest aspect, both have regrets from their past and hope to be stronger to be able to face it, both are able to share their stories and feelings of their current situations and they liked each other! My god, just look at how compatible they are! But, because she's a typical princess trope, she has to return to her country first, so that the protagonist will struggle to live on without her, so he'll decide to fly to where she lives and confess his feelings._Ta-dah!_ They're together! Yup, it's pretty generic.\n~~~img440(https://i1.wp.com/comicsverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Teresa-Wagner.jpg?ssl=1)~~~\n~~~_\"Gawd, Just too cute, I can't handle this anymore\"_~~~\nNow to the supporting cast, I'm going to list out every irrelevant character first before we move on to the main supporting cast. Cat, useless. Senpai, hentai. Idol, thot. Dog Guy, pointless. The Sister, needless. Now let's move on to the bro of this series. Tada's overly excited childhood friend, Kaoru Ijuuin. A friend who is always there for Tada, when he needs a talk, when he is sick when he is at his downest, this butt-fucking friend will always be with him. As a matter of fact, he is so gay for Tada, I don't mind if the true route were Tada x Ijuuin. Jokes aside, in spite of his clumsiness and annoyance, he is the brighter spot of the show where he is able to help our protagonist to make progress rather than being an ungrateful shithead.\n\nIn the same fashion, Alexandra Magritte, code name Alec is Teresa's personal bodyguard, who is probably the most complex character in the series and is someone who is always there for Teresa. When she needs a talk, when she is unhappy, when she is at her downest, this overly attached bodyguard will always be with her. As a matter of fact, she's so gay for Teresa, I don't mind if the true route were Teresa x Alec. Like I said earlier, Alec is the most complex characters in the series due to her position for not just being an eternal bodyguard, but Teresa's first and best friend. She also has a crush on Teresa's fianc\u00c3\u00a9, but she knows her place and to not let her emotions interfere with traditions. Now, to the fianc\u00c3\u00a9, Charles de Loire. He is the definition of [Shirou 2.0](http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Shirou_Emiya), he is so desperate for Teresa's happiness, every time he appears, we know this character ain't a threat to the final route. For this reason, he is the most pointless but relevant character of the series. But wait, when you think about it, isn't he the one who always put others over himself? \n\n__Art/ Animation:__\nAlright, now to the strong category of this anime. The art is spectacular and consistent, from beautiful sceneries to Teresa's smile, I have to say that this anime is appealing to look at. Their art style may not be that interesting, but it doesn't look like shit to me, so I am totally fine with that. It's just a shame that there wasn't that much photography in this anime. As for the opening, it is definitely a runner-up for this year's best opening. The song is catchy, the animations are wild and colorful, but nothing is going to beat [Wotaku's](https://anilist.co/anime/99578/) unmatched opening for this season. \n\n__Sound/ Voice Acting/ Music: __\nLike the previous category, their sound is mostly great and nothing specifically to point out. I guess for Teresa's voice actress, [Manaka Iwami](https://anilist.co/staff/121821/Manaka-Iwami), did a decent job while still being a rookie in the industry. Everyone else is vets like [Miyano Mamoru](https://anilist.co/staff/95065/Mamoru-Miyano), [Nakamura Yuuichi](https://anilist.co/staff/95513/Yuuichi-Nakamura), and [Minase Inori](https://anilist.co/staff/106297/Inori-Minase). They always give their best performance for their roles so nothing of complaints from me, albeit it was nothing we've never seen. As for the soundtracks, it is not something that I'll forever imprint into my mind, but its calm tone fits its story. It works as a device that improvises on the entire cinematography of the series. I'd say that is a good thing. The opening is yet again beaten by Wotaku's much catchier song in my own opinion, while I personally think Manaka Iwami flunked the ending song because it sounded way too cheesy to me. \n\n__Enjoyment:__\nI'd be lying if I said I don't like this series one bit, although it being one of the most generic shows I've ever seen, I still manage to finish this series. In conclusion, this series could have been better, it could have explored a deeper human depth like how [Toradora](https://anilist.co/anime/4224/) did, or it could have been a light-hearted comedy show like [Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun](https://anilist.co/anime/20668/), but it didn't. Usually, I blasted an anime like these until it no longer has a redeemable quality, this series somehow made me enjoy it with their great cinematography, consistent animation, and likable characters. To sum it up, it's not an anime you'll remember for long. The biggest flaw of the anime still has to be its title. God, the title sucks. \n\n~~~img550(https://i.imgur.com/8c7S5Tu.png)~~~\n~~~_\"10/10 for Teresa, gawd damn it!\"_~~~\n\nTL;DR\nPositives:\n+ Teresa sho cuuuuute\n+ Great Animation and Sound\n+ Some good character arc\n\nNegatives:\n- Fillers\n- Wasted or Irrelevant Characters\n- generic\n- Just.. generic.. \n\n__Actual Score: 4.6/10__\n\n__Guilty Pleasure Score: 6.4/10__  (I'm using my guilty pleasure score cause Teresa is too cute)\n\n\n"}, {"id": 2835, "score": 63, "body": "How to start on this, there's a few fantasy shows out there, especially those based on war.  A similar show by concept is actually Madan no Ou to Vanadis (Romanji name), except that one is more fanservice/ecchi based.  This show isn't bad when on full analysis, a lot of the concepts are actually quite cool, such as the crests.  The problems simply lie upon the characters themselves.  You have an anime protagonist, no charisma, a selfless \"I won't let anyone die\" mentality, and a 'go-with the flow' tactical view.  Yet he sees every sort of success despite not having much of a forefront plan.  There are characters who show a lot of tactical prowess throughout the series, or just military strength, and he is able to beat them by sheer... being a protagonist.\n\nNow, the protagonist is far from the only problem.  The other leaders are tropes too, Alexis is basically your shy 'I don't want any bloodshed' type character, yet is quite obviously meant to be the only character that can stop Marrine, who the show forces you to see her as misguided.  It doesn't really let you pick your own side, unlike a normal Western-style show with factions like these.  Usually they let you choose who you like.  Either way, there's another thing I would like to point out.\nyoutube(https://youtu.be/IZPxoSbeHr0?t=44s)\nHear the song here?  That is pretty much the _only_ song that exists in this anime.  Have battle music?  Not much of it, gotta have you listen to the noises of battle, but now that they're winning the battle, gotta play this song and blast it so we make sure you hear it!  I do want to return to characters and point out how great a character Lassic is, as well as the people who serve him.\n\nThe show really did have promise, if different plots were not just shoehorned in.  The setting was great, different characters were pretty good, and I mentioned the crests... though it seemed to take far too long to actually utilize an interesting aspect of the crests, multiple crests later on how specific unique powers to them, that were severely lacking in the crests earlier on.  The magic seemed cool and would have been interesting to see in depth, but plot line messed that up.  Plus the battles getting overall worse later on.  I think the last thing I can cover is that the ending was massively disappointing.  It pushed some ending battles and kind of just... ended them.  ~!I feel like the author started something and forgot to actually answer pieces, why is there only one valkyrie? what even happened to that group? What happened to the Nordic daughter?  And even then, the fight with the vampire ended like instantly, and then they come back to the war being over and the fight they completely hyped up was just... off screened.!~  It's... well, what I said in the summary.  Missed Potential."}, {"id": 2838, "score": 55, "body": "It seems that after the success of *Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun*, Doga Kobo attempted to replicate that with *Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai.* Due to most of the main staff reprising their roles: from the director, to the opening theme's singer and to the main character's VA, most hailed this as a spiritual successor to *GSNK*. \n\nLet's see how they did.\n\n_WARNING: Spoilers!_\n\n__STORY__ 5/10\n\nThe premise of _Tadakoi_ is rather simple: Teresa transfers to Tada's school and joins the photography club, where the rest of the characters are introduced. Teresa and the Tada slowly get closer and closer. Unfortunately, Teresa is a princess and the only child of the royal family, so she must uphold the tradition and marry a noble in her home country. Meanwhile, Tada doesn't fall in love due his past experiences (hence the title: *Tada-kun never falls in love*). Cue drama!\n\nIt's simple, but that's fine because most slice of life romcoms are. It leaves plenty of opportunities to create funny and emotional scenes, so what matters is the execution. Sadly, this is where *Tadakoi* fails.\n\nThe plot is basically seeing each character fall in love, since everyone is set up with a potential love interest right from the start. Each subplot gets its own episode to be focused on and develo- WAIT! There is no development...\n\nAlas, the person in charge of series composition must've been fired halfway through production because *none of these subplots go anywhere.* By the end of the anime, not one subplot has been resolved, they were simply introduced and then forgotten about.\n\nThe main plot focusing on Tada and Teresa is better, but the bar was low enough that it's not really an achievement. Most of their time is spent bonding, though their dynamic is so bland that this becomes rather boring and repetitive after a few episodes. \n\nAfter realising they've fallen in love with each other, Teresa runs away because she has her responsibilities as a princess, and Tada chases after her and must overcome his past regrets to finally confess how he feels. Teresa is distraught, because she loves him too but considers her duties more important, hence she cannot accept his feelings. Tada makes his peace with this, and goes home. They vow never to forget their feelings for each other.\n\nIt's a nice plot, with a good underlying message of \"Sometimes life doesn't go the way you want but that's okay.\" \n\nBut then Teresa goes:\n>Well, fuck being a princess lmfao, I'll just be a transfer student again so I can never be away from you Tada-kun! \n\nAnd then they kiss... what?!\n\nIt's a mess.\n\n__CHARACTERS__ 2/10\n\nThis is by far the worst part.\n\nThe characters all start off as very basic archetypes. Thankfully enough, there's a few quirks thrown in to make it a little more interesting. \n- Tada: scared of falling in love\n- Teresa: otaku\n- Alec: in love with best friend's betrothed\n- Kaoru: good cook\n- Hinako: a very popular model\n- Hajime: worships said model\n- Kentarou: basically a puppy\n- Yui: loves reading detective books (which is neatly tied in with some other characters)\n\nStarting out with very simple characters is fine, but from there you should:\n1. Have genuinely interesting intereactions\n2. Actually develop them\n\n*Tadakoi* makes a pathetic attempt at doing both.\n\nAs a romcom, the focus is on romance and comedy. Gags depend purely on each of their character types, but none of the situations are unique or interesting enough for them to actually seem fresh. After a few episodes I could almost predict every line they were going to say. It's not funny when you can predict the punch line in almost every scene... it's just boring.\n\nSide characters were simply introduced and then used as background pieces that interject ~~frustratingly repetitive~~ \"funny\" lines like some horrific broken record that won't stop playing. Ijuin Kaoru started off as entertaining but then somebody decided that he should butt in at the end of every emotional and dramatic scene with his obnoxiously overacted voice, and he quickly became insufferable. I never thought I'd dislike Miyano Mamoru's voice acting but I did by the end of this show.\n\nA love square develops between Tada, Teresa, Alec and Charles. Alec and Charles are both willing to sacrifice their happiness for Teresa, and the show seemingly punishes them for this by creating a situation where either one can be happy and the other cannot. To make matters worse, neither get the chance to properly express how they feel, yet the show acts like it's a good ending.\n\nThe biggest failing is Teresa and Tada's relationship. They have no chemistry. They are not interesting to watch. Their interactions are basically limited to Teresa constantly nerding out at every possible Rainbow Shogun reference and Tada making small noises of approval. After seven episodes of this, they finally have some meaningful moments when they open up about their past. With this single moment where they actually have some chemistry, Teresa just fucking falls in love with Tada. \n\nShe then promptly runs back home without explanation, scared of her feelings. Her whole country celebrates her and Charles' engagement. People are selling photos of the royal family, they're going to hold a royal ball, Teresa is convinced that this is what's right as the only child of the royal family... and then decides it's not and runs back to Tada. _MAKE UP YOUR MIND GIRL!_ \n\nIf it sounds poorly written then that's because it is. \n\n**ART & ANIMATION** 8/10\n\nThis is almost the exact same staff that worked on GSNK, which is clear from the art and animation. \n\nThe art style is simple but pleasant, and the greenery in particular is really beautiful. The animation wasn't as interesting or dynamic as I had hoped, but there are some gorgeous moments in there. In particular: Tada and Teresa's first meeting and later Teresa realising her feelings for him. The directing is great, with some really evocative shots in the most climatic scenes.\n\n**SOUND** 8/10\n\nThe opening theme is happy and upbeat, perfectly fitting for the concept and a personal favourite of mine. The ending theme is a bittersweet ballad sung by Teresa's VA. It's pleasant and gives some nice foreshadowing to the events of the show.\n\nThe OST is mostly composed of piano, guitar and violin pieces. They're enjoyable and fit the mood of each scene well. The track that plays when Teresa realises she's fallen in love with Tada is particularly stunning and complements one of the best scenes in the show.\n\nVoice acting was of a high standard, but there were no exceptional performances. This is mainly due to most VAs not getting the opportunity to showcase their skills. Few side characters had moments of heightened emotions, so their performance was limited to normal conversations. As mentioned before, Miyano Mamoru's performance was overdone but it fit Ijuin's character perfectly, it's just the way that his character was used that irritated me (mainly that he never dropped the playful tone of his voice).\n\n**ENJOYMENT** 2/10\n\nThe only thing stopping me from rating this a 1 is that I didn't actively dislike *Tadakoi* by the end, I was just very bored by it. It had a lot of promise but the execution was just appalling. The final episode had plenty of moments that should've made me cry but the lack of attachment I felt towards any of the characters meant that I just couldn't feel emotional for them.\n\nThe wasted potential is incredibly frustrating. Hopefully Doga Kobo gets their act together for their next project.\n"}, {"id": 2841, "score": 60, "body": "First off, let me make it clear that I'm a huge Ace Attorney fan. The games are all very dear to me, and the first three are, in my opinion, especially spectacular. This anime covers the events of the first two games.\n\nSo, first, let's talk presentation. I quite like the background music, it's pretty fitting and the main theme is super catchy. Some of the court themes are a little underwhelming, but overall I'd say the music does its job pretty well. Both the OPs and one of the EDs are very idoly - if you like idol music, you'll probably like them. If you don't, then you probably won't. The other ED is a (in my opinion) very nice pop ballad. Cool.\n\nSo, the character design. I actually think the characters generally look pretty visually appealing. They all look pretty similar if not identical to how they look in the games. Well, when they're not moving. Unfortunately, the animation is _not_ so good. The characters are nearly always horribly off model. Not in a good KonoSuba way, in a \"this anime was far too rushed and lacking a decent budget\" kind of way. The animations aren't nice looking or interesting, they're just dull and bad. Also, side note, the background characters' faces in this show look _hideous_. I get that they're going to look as good as the foreground characters - that would be pointless - but they just look _appalling_ in this, sometimes even to the point of being distracting. When the faces in your show look distractingly bad, that's when there's a problem.\n\nThere are also some strange changes to the story. I should note first though that there were always going to have to be some changes when adapting this series to anime. I understand this. Some changes were actually really good. Having screens in court to replace the game's UI works really well. That was a good change. On the other hand, sometimes certain characters were replaced with other ones for no reason whatsoever. It doesn't improve the show in any way, and just serves to confuse fans of the games. It's not like it ruined the show or anything, it just seemed super weird and unnecessary. Oh well.\n\nBut now I want to talk about what I believe to be the real problem with this anime is. The reason fans of the games and newcomers alike found it to be pretty \"meh\". These games just don't work very well in a non-interactive medium. The whole joy of the Ace Attorney series comes from that \"aha!\" moment when you finally find a lie in a witness's testimony, when you discover a damning piece of evidence, and when you nail a killer. The whole satisfaction of these moments is YOU working it out, and that just doesn't really work as an anime. Sure, it can still be interesting to find out who did it and how in the anime, but the real satisfaction, the thing that made the series as successful as it is, comes from the interactivity of the game medium.\n\nSo I think this anime wasn't awful. It had many enjoyable moments, and there are aspects that I really do like about it. But in somes ways, it never could have lived up the the heights of the games for me, and I think for many others too. It _can_ be an interesting companion to the games, and I enjoyed seeing the stories I loved animated on screen, but as a stand alone series, I'm afraid that this anime was, in my opinion, a failure.\n\nNevertheless, I look forward to the next season.

Both aspects feel like a more than necessary breath of fresh air and I'm thankful for being able to experience something different. What happens is that, from my perspective, the anime is not entertaining enough when it tries to be or sufficiently transcendental when its narrative changes its focus to a more serious one. It doesn't find a correct tone and, in the end, its development doesn't feel satisfactory. And it's true, the main theme addressed, related to good and evil, the possible decline of humanity to chaos and its capacity for redemption is cannon fodder for a more nihilistic, cynical, and tragic approach. Therefore one could assign that \"bitter taste\" to this style, but even there I feel that Devilman stumbles.\nimg220(https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODVlOWI0OTAtYTJkNC00M2I5LWJiMDctZGYyMzNhNzVlMzYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjY5NTM5MjA@._V1_.jpg) img220(https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2U1YjA3NjYtNWQ1Mi00Mzg0LWJjMGItZjc2NGMyYTY5Y2MzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_.jpg)\nAnd yes, I can say that the first episodes are genuinely entertaining, but I can't find anything of value beyond, well, that. The characters don't help much when it comes to praising the quality of the anime. When the chaos runs loose and the blood starts shedding, the events that should elicit an emotional response feel like one more death or one more problem. Another piece that goes off the board, but that is not the King or the Queen, not even a Rook. There is a possible exception to this rule with a member of the cast I deem likeable. But this one is \"built\" to be lovable and that doesn't stop it from being a one-dimensional character like the rest of the ensemble and no story in retrospect was enough to convince me otherwise. Moreover, those backstories didn't help the last episodes of the anime which were already damaged by the inconsistent rhythm, lack of sobriety and numerous tonal changes.\nimg220(https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzQ2MWMzZmYtYTFkZS00ZGI1LWI4ZGYtZDE3N2Y2MTc5YzMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjY5NTM5MjA@._V1_.jpg) img220(https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGQyYjNjYzktODA5ZC00NDkyLTlmODItZmQ4OTM4MWE2YjJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjMxNzQ2NTQ@._V1_.jpg)\nI have no problem with excessive violence or the constant sex scenes that the series shows, because I understand that they are inherent to its narrative and the idea of \u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b\"demons arise from human baseness\".

Sure it is not the worst anime to air in Spring 2018, it isn't near decent as far as I know.\n\nThe plot idea of trapping inside digital world had started long before Sword Art Online and whatever comes after that. However such idea still exist, mainly because of the psychological effect it creates upon the trapped characters and also the audience. We, as the audience who are psychological horror are interested to find out why are the characters being trapped in a digital world and how do they come out from it or will they? And that's why people are giving Caligula a chance. However, there are also people who fear it will disappoint them because the anime is adapted from a game and most of them do not end up well.\n\nPersonally, I find myself getting bored about the anime, I had stopped halfway to wait for the series to end (same goes with Darling in the FranXX). And I had read one of the episode review about ANN, well it is not as bad as it is said for the anime overall but looking at it episodically, sure it does. Only the last two episodes had me sit through the anime and think that, \"it isn't that bad after all.\" Provided you complete it in one go.\n\nTwo most important things they have gone wrong in this anime that had it landed between 6-6.5/10 for me.\n\n__Characters__ \nIn a psychological anime, characters development is the most important thing as the anime has to display what, how, why causes the characters to be depressed and to fall to another side. \n\nThe most boring but useful way is to introduce each character for their background story one by one from the least priority to the most priority (especially for protagonist on the last episode) and link all the characters together along the way. However, the information are not given besides their surface level of suffering from pain in real life before escaping to Mobius. \n\nDuring the fights launch from the antagonists, there are flashback about the characters but due to episodes constrain, even though I understand the situation, I don't find myself feeling sympathetic about their suffering. \n\nAnd for the protagonist side? They sit around a room and start the healing session by talking out their darkest inner part of them. Again, due to limitation of screen time for each of them in a fairly big cast, I don't feel sad at all. More like I kinda forget what's going on.\n\nAnd did I mention the missing linkage between each episode except the last 3 or 4 episodes?\n\n__Plot__\nContinuing from last sentence, skips and bad pace are the ones which affects an anime quality. Nobody had the time or patience to sit through every anime, especially when the genre is not their most favorite or they have not play the game, read the manga/novel beforehand?\n\nFirst two episodes are the good to start the plot and attract people to continue but getting further, the skips are getting worst. New characters pop up randomly, no linkage between episodes and basically it feels like some characters gone through a complete change in personality compare to few episodes ago.\n\nLast 2 episodes are the best and probably the most enjoyable to watch hand in hand, the things character go through in Mobius, realizing even though reality pains them, living in digital world does not necessary means happiness. But I appreciates not everyone think this way and still decide to stay in Mobius. This is what makes people think. What is real happiness, the anime brings out the most important question. Myu though that happiness is happiness but what if someone's happiness meaning other people suffering? What is a person's happiness is to bully and destroy a person's sanity and Myu can fulfill that wish, is that real happiness for everyone? \n\nThere is one more reason to watch the last 2 episodes, it's about real Ritsu. Watch and you will know.\n\nBy the way, OP/ED are good so here's a 0.5 add-on, total 6.5/10\n"}, {"id": 2853, "score": 65, "body": "Drifters is a seinen title based on the manga by Kouta Hirano. The story is set in a medieval fantasy world where both humans and demi humans (such as elves and dwarves) live. This world is soon greeted by two sets of foreigners from the real world - \u00e2\u0080\u009cDrifters\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cEnds\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Both groups are comprised of historical figures tied to war or a fight of their time. They are taken before their death by one of two mysterious people. A man named Murasaki chooses fighters for his Drifters, while a girl named Easy picks candidates for her Ends. What sets them apart are their given roles in this story. The Ends seek out the destruction of humankind and the Drifters are assigned to stop the Ends from their slaughter.\n\nAs the name implies, the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perspective is from the eyes of the Drifters. Though there is a fair amount of fighters with this title, the anime focuses on three in particular. Toyohisa Shimazu is the appointed leader of the group and is a classic warrior type, whose battle-minded ways make him great in the fights but a bit barbaric outside of them. Nobunaga Oda is a crafty middle-aged man, dubbed the \u00e2\u0080\u009cDevil King of the Sixth Heaven\u00e2\u0080\u009d who doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fight as much as come up with strategy to make the Drifters team a fighting threat. Finally, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Yoichi Nasu, a bishonen archer whose aim is as good as his looks. The anime follows these three as they work their way up to be a formidable foe, from freeing demi humans from their serfdom and slavery to coming up with cunning plans in the midst of a fight.\n\nThe concept of Drifters isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t too far removed from one of Hirano\u00e2\u0080\u0099s previous works, Hellsing. Hellsing mainly attracted an audience by blending its dark supernatural characters with hyper violence, occasionally sprinkling in historical references. Drifters changes this mixture \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it still has the violence and supernatural elements, but it grounds itself more so in the history. Despite being a fantasy world, it feels more down-to-earth than other shows with this title. The Octobrists are a magician organization that wishes for the Drifters support to defeat the Ends. Though they are magicians, they are only seen using basic spells called \u00e2\u0080\u009ccharms\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Their communication, though much more advanced than the setting, relies on a magic sphere on two users\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ends, acting more like a phone than anything magical. Though what we see is limited, it shines due to how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s used. Toyohisa and the gang use the Octobrists\u00e2\u0080\u0099 magic in interesting ways to serve their needs, showing how easily they adapt to foreign concepts. Spells the Octobrists thought of only for defense are used offensively to surprise and crush the enemy. Even the communication orb was used primarily as a \u00e2\u0080\u009crecording diary\u00e2\u0080\u009d before the Drifters came along! I prefer this creative use of magic over the typical mage/wizard roles seen in fantasy shows.\n\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say this show is free from absurd magic. The Ends are characters that have \u00e2\u0080\u009cgiven up their humanity\u00e2\u0080\u009d for strong magical power. This is seen in Jeanne D\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Arc, who has incredible fire magic, and Toshizou, who uses ghost warriors to assist him in battle. Most interesting is the dreaded Black King, who has power over cellular replication that can heal/hurt single targets almost instantly. What makes these powers exciting is how they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been given to the villains, not the heroes. Wits dominate fights against the Ends and seeing how the Drifters turn the tide in battle is a lot of fun to watch. Fans of JoJo Part 2: Battle Tendency will adore these fights, as Toyohisa parallels Joseph Joestar. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing in Drifters that will make you rethink battles, but there are a few surprises that kept me wanting to watch the next episode.\n\nDrifters has an interesting lot of characters, which is its strength and one of its problems. I find there are too many of them for this short first season and they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to be here this early on. Characters like Butch Cassidy and Naoshi Kanno really had no reason being here. They may have turned the tide in the battle they were present in, minor as it was, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re never really seen beyond this. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure all the Drifters will meet up eventually to take down the Black King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s army, but they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to be present at this time. This time could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been use for more focus on the main trio, in particular Yoichi. Despite being labeled as a main character, Yoichi doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get a whole lot of time or emphasis compared to Oda or Toyohisa. I saw Toyohisa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s warrior life in action in and outside of fights and I saw the humor mixed with dark cunning of Oda. Save for a brief moment talking to his old leader, Yoshitsune, Yoichi felt more like a strong supporting character. I hope that more insight will be given to him.\n\nHumor is another thing Hirano and I generally disagree on. In Hellsing, ugly chibi-looking characters would break the ice at the wrong time and would be a lot cruder than what I like. This returns in Drifters, but I find it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been toned down a bit. The toilet humor seems less prevalent in these scenes. Though one of Hannibal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first \u00e2\u0080\u009cjokes\u00e2\u0080\u009d is that he can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t control his bladder, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bit more understandable as he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very old (though I still could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done without it). The humor mainly focuses on references to Japanese war history. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t my strong suit, so moments like the Drifters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 first meetup in Episode 1 went over my head. That said, they normally are quick off-hand jokes, so they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fill up the show as much as they give a wink to a history loving audience.\n\nDrifters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 art is what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d expect from Hirano. Characters have large ringed irises for eyes, thick jagged lines make their outlines, and shadows that cover their face (save for a single eye) are all present. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a style that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s distinctly his and works great for his action series. Of course, the series also includes Hirano\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cugly faces\u00e2\u0080\u009d he uses for comedy but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not as bad here. Maybe because there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s less poop drawings or perhaps I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve grown accustomed to it. The animation team at Hoods Drifters Studio did a fair job. They use CG models at times (such as the soldiers) and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the most fluid, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not bad by any means. Sometimes it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even in their favor - I like the \u00e2\u0080\u009crough sketch\u00e2\u0080\u009d animatic look in the opening, more so than the cheap animation tweens that accompany it. The music of the series is upbeat rock and fits the action well. One track I like in particular starts as a flute track played through an old radio before becoming a strange Middle Eastern sounding piece. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care for the \u00e2\u0080\u009clazy cool\u00e2\u0080\u009d vocals (with the \u00e2\u0080\u009caw yeahs\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the verses) and sound of the opening and I do not like Kurosaki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vocals for the ED (the acoustic guitar in the final episode was a welcome change). The seiyuus all did a fine job, though none here stood out in particular for me.\n\nOverall, I give Drifters a 6.5/10. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care too much for Hellsing, so I was surprised as to how much I liked Drifters. If you liked Hellsing, or perhaps Hirano\u00e2\u0080\u0099s style in general, this is a must-watch. Those looking for a fun action series akin to JoJo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bizarre Adventure will also appreciate this show. Drifters is a bit fantastic in concept and occasionally campy, but it was a fun watch and I certainly wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind viewing a second season.\n\nDo you like or dislike this anime?

The film takes place in a strange abandoned world, where the skeletal remains of animals and murky rivers meet Neo-Gothic structures. The film centers on only two characters \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they are, supposedly, the only two alive in this film. One is a pale-skinned, white haired girl, who is fascinated by filling up round flasks with water and who protects an egg with unknown contents. The other is a brown-skinned, white haired boy, who accompanies the girl midway through the film. Not much is known about him, other than that he carries a cross-shaped object with him.\n\nThe movie doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really have a linear story and is presented more as a series of scenes. We see the boy and girl, whether individually or together, encounter and react to their world around them. Despite being labeled as a fantasy, these locations themselves aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anything beyond fantastic \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they range from parks to a small town. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s featured inside of these places is where things get bizarre. In the town, for example, statues of fishermen hunt shadows of giant fish despite there being no more fish in this world. These small oddities make it so no matter the \u00e2\u0080\u009cscene\u00e2\u0080\u009d being viewed, something strange will occur to let the viewer know this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the world they know.\n\nAngel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Egg is a hard movie to give a review, largely due to it being more of an experimental piece than a conventional anime movie or series. It has a mysterious atmosphere about it and isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very explicit about its premise or characters. Character dialogue is sparse and symbolic images are used often. Because of this, a majority of a viewer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enjoyment will be tied to how they interpret each scene and how much they wish to invest themselves into the movie. There is a hint as to what the creator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intentions were. Director Mamoru Oshii had lost his faith in Christianity shortly before film production and that alone can be the key to connecting a lot of the film together. On the flip-side, Oshii has reportedly been quoted as saying that even he does not know what the film is about. If this is true, then this film is more of an expression of feeling than of actual thought. It is certainly a product of its time. Humorously enough, it was brought to the U.S. and interspersed with live-action footage with the goal of making it a post-apocalyptic thriller. How anybody saw commercial prospects from this movie, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never know. Besides, to tie in with the themes of the movie, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d argue the film is more post-rapture than post-apocalyptic.\n\nThe film makes reference to religious (mostly Christian) beliefs, which tie in to Oshii\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loss of faith. Stained glass windows featuring fish and the boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cross shaped object are a few of the smaller references to these beliefs. Most notable is the boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s corrupted version of Chapters 7-8 of Genesis. He claims that when the dove never came back, Noah and everyone on the ark remained there, soon forgetting about the dove and even themselves. Between these symbols and long stretches of silence are short scenes of dialogue that help shape who these characters are. For instance, the girl expresses her desire to see whatever is inside the egg, promising a place of warmness and comfort despite the cold rainy weather outside. The boy comes off as more cynical while the girl is hopeful and optimistic. Because of the lack of characters, having these two contrast each other is a smart decision. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t found in just their attitude. The girl seems more familiar with her surroundings while the boy clearly is new to the area. Even if the events of the anime aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fully explained, moments where the girl shows or warns the boy of something help bring me closer to the world of Angel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Egg, wanting to know more about the peculiarity that permeates this world.\n\nThe art for this film is very gloomy, preferring darker colors to give the movie a more melancholy tone. The only exception is found at the beginning, where the boy encounters an eye-like structure with statues on it amidst a scarlet backdrop. The film has decent animation and captures things like the fluidity of water or the facial expressions of the girl well. However, it does have a few flaws. Long stills are usually used to impact an important scene or draw out a feeling of finality. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s used a few times here but I felt that they went on for a bit too long. It became less of a feeling of impact and more of a way of filling up time. Additionally, animation in the fish hunting scene and the girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s awakening scene are reused. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a bit more forgiving on this since I know it was most likely a low budget film and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not as easily apparent. The soundtrack may be the weakest element here. Earlier, I said the movie was a product of its time and I meant it in more ways than one. Tape hiss is heard constantly throughout the film and the higher frequencies found in whistles and screams are harsher than they need be. The music itself is appropriate for the film, with a booming male chorus for the fish hunting scene and a piece for violin and female voice used during the title screen. The only true unconventional piece that comes to mind is the credits piece, which is a sole piano that uses repetition to mask its odd melody line. The voice acting is fine, as sparse as it is \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the only negative would be Mako Hyodou\u00e2\u0080\u0099s yelling voice, but this is more a flat reaction than an actual critique.\n\nOverall, I give Angel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Egg a 6. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an odd, almost mythic movie that enshrouds itself in mystery. Despite its gloomy appearance and avant-garde leanings, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t push a viewer away. Instead, it gives them opportunities to dive into its world and leave it haunting their memory. This film will entice those liked more experimental works such as BLAME! or Serial Experiments Lain. Even if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care for those shows, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d still ask that you give it a chance. At only a little over an hour long, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth watching at least once.\n\nDo you like or dislike this anime? If you haven't watched it, are you encouraged to watch it or not?

"}, {"id": 2869, "score": 55, "body": "My Basic Thoughts: \nWe all know this much, it's the sequel of Tokyo Ghoul, taking place a couple years after the first series. Starting from Chapter 1, it had a very strong start with the introduction of the Qs and Haise as main characters. This strong and intellectual writing continued throughout until it got about halfway, where a very noticeable drop in quality was taken. \n\nMy Complaints: \nHaise's character became confusing, whilst not having very much sense in the backstory, should've acted extremely different because of what he had experienced. The decisions he made and what he was saying did not align with who he was as a character, which made me really dislike him as a character around chapter 70. Sure, Tokyo Ghoul re is hype, because Tokyo Ghoul is always hype (lol), but the hypness doesn't always excuse for when the characters don't improve or make no sense from what they were presented as. The main problem I had with the series was the seemingly devolution of Haise and Touka as characters, with every other character maturing and growing around them. Another thing I had disliked was the joking nature of some characters toxic behaviors (hitting between lovers) and blatant reduce to comedy relief (Tsukiyama). Another problem was the disregard of once big plotpoints and mysteries nearly completely ignored or put off to the side(Nearly everything involving Hide). A final flaw that wasn't very huge in the span of things, but got on my nerves a bit, was the awful LGBT characters.. They were represented very very poorly and were made out to just be stereotypical representations of what a person thought they are in the most basic sense. It made me extremely disappointed to see all of these take place, and with the ending chapter solidifying these thoughts. It felt like Ishida wanted the series to end, and gave what the majority wanted, which is never the right idea for a great series that Tokyo Ghoul once was. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArt: 7/10 - Very good, a definite improvement from the first series (although some fight scenes are confusing)\nCharacters: 3/10 - All of my complaints are above\nStory: 5/10 - Enjoyable, but still had many problems (stemming from the character inconsistencies)\n\nOverall: 5.5/10 - will probably buy volumes 1-6, but not anything after :/ \nWould not recommend"}, {"id": 2874, "score": 60, "body": "Gunbuster is a sci-fi/mecha title by Studio Gainax and directed by Hideaki Anno. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a futuristic title initially set in the year 2023, where high school age students are enrolled in training camps to learn how to pilot fighting robots. The reason? A swarm of alien creatures determined to eradicate humanity is heading towards Earth. Among the students enrolled in the Okinawa training facility are Noriko Takaya, a girl who lost her father in a space battle against these creatures a few years prior, and Kazumi Amano, a top-of-class mech fighter that sports a mature personality. The series focuses on these two as they aim to enter the Top Squadron, a space center where the best candidates from each school are sent to fight against the incoming alien force. Furthermore, the training coach at Okinawa, Kouichirou Oota, has his sights on the two girls to be part of the Gunbuster mech, a robot being developed to be the most powerful tool that the human race has to defeat the alien threat!\n\nThe plot to Gunbuster isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anything that will surprise a viewer. The show has its sci-fi jargon and giant robots, as we follow Noriko as she rises the ranks of robot klutz to space fighting master. In between these moments is where Gunbuster shines. The show laces themes of trust, overcoming fear and, most importantly, the passage of time within its episodes. Hideaki Anno\u00e2\u0080\u0099s style seems to focus in more on the emotions of Noriko and Amano, trying to get the audience in sync with their ecstatic highs and crushing lows. Watching Noriko train herself to be a better fighter in Episode 1, growing above the cruel scorn and actions of her classmates, is a good example of this. Later in the series, Amano and Noriko have to rise above personal events for humanity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tomorrow. Love and loss need to take a balance to what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at stake. One could call it a bit dramatic at times, but I never got the feeling that Anno and the writing staff put in a breakdown for the sake of it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the way of seeing the complete picture of Noriko and Amano. If Noriko were bubbly and na\u00c3\u00afve while Amano remained her mature (albeit slightly judgmental) aura, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d really only see one side to the story. Anno\u00e2\u0080\u0099s later project, the controversial Neon Genesis Evangelion, would push these emotional concepts to a histrionic extreme \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for now, it serves as a bit of grounding to characters that wish to soar beyond the stars.\n\nAnno also seems to put a few references to things he was interested in into the show to make it feel a bit more personal. Is it a coincidence that Noriko Takaya shares the same name with her voice actor Noriko Hidaka? What about Jung Freud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name, which evokes famous psychoanalysts Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud? With these personal \u00e2\u0080\u009ceaster eggs\u00e2\u0080\u009d placed in the show, Gunbuster was more like Anno\u00e2\u0080\u0099s short passion project than a mecha show.\n\nThough a passion project can make for an interesting watch, there lies the main problem with Gunbuster \u00e2\u0080\u0093 its running time. With only 6 episodes, Anno struggles to find a balance between what he wants to say and the main story of the show. As a result, these elements get rushed. Some moments that were supposed to be endearing never really made a full impact with me. Take a look, for instance, at Commander Oota\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motivational speeches to Noriko \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they have a rushed delivery, compacting a lot of \u00e2\u0080\u009cbelieve in yourself\u00e2\u0080\u009d speech into a short time span. Some characters like Jung Freud, despite being a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmain\u00e2\u0080\u009d character, are more of an acquaintance than someone I could really connect with the main cast. I appreciate the show for what it did in its timespan, but at the same time, 1 or 2 more episodes (or, at the least, a Director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cut) could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve fully unlocked what the show wants to get across.\n\nThe animation for Gunbuster is very good. It has a few moments of repeated animation, but for the most part conveys a scene and its emotions well. Gainax wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the powerhouse studio it would become, so the amount of effort put into the action scenes can sometimes be astounding. The anime has a look that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely of its time (the girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 outfits being leotards being one example), but it again reflects a certain level of personal investment the staff at Gainax put into it. Call the costumes and bath scenes lecherous, but they seem more like the animators having fun than trying to make a full-blown ecchi title. The one complaint I have has to do with Noriko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye design, which isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so much round as amorphous. Though the level of detail found in the eyes are good, the look of them feels a bit off. This is more of a personal complaint than a problem \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not too accustomed with the look. The soundtrack is what seals the deal for Gunbuster making its full impact. Kouhei Tonaka, the man behind the music of Gunbuster, blends together a mix of 80\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pop music clich\u00c3\u00a9s with dramatic strings to create the emotional drive for key scenes in the show. The training montage, for instance, has a Chariots of Fire sounding piece accompanying it while battle scenes mix in horns with a piano backing to give a sense of power with poignancy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 an orchestra of emotion in a small package. It is definitely one of the anime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s highlights. The OP and ED follow suit with a cute 80\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pop sound, perfect for the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time. The V.A.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s were hand-in-glove for their roles and the voices matched the look and tone the characters set out.\n\nOverall, I give Gunbuster a 6.0 out of ten. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not perfect, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it really strove out to be. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a show made by fans of the genre for fans of the genre. This level of honesty in popular anime isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always seen and I can appreciate it when I see it. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a fan of Neon Genesis Evangelion or character-focused shows, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find a lot to love here. Sci-fi enthusiasts may also enjoy it for the time/space dialogue present within the show. Those who think Gunbuster is just a prototype for Evangelion may just change their minds upon viewing it.\n\nDo you like or dislike this anime?

"}, {"id": 2880, "score": 50, "body": "I've gotten up to episode eight but felt the need to start a review now. This will not be spoiler free.\nSo the show is your very typical run of the mill isekai, with nothing really setting it apart from the others; even the \"other races\" are reduced to a few smatters of elves (if elves can even be considered an 'other' race in isekai anymore) some basic furries and a few kemonomimi tamer than even Monmusu. It feels like another Overlord because of the \"rl dude gets stuck in a world based on a game and is basically god and almost no one else in the fantasy world is from earth\" and turns the character immediately into a god because of some deus ex machina right at episode one. So we have to sit through his leveling skills with his near infinite skill points and becoming immediately perfect at every skill that pops up. Which of course no one questions. He tries (minimally) to hide his rl and game-god nature of course just like in Overlord, but overall really doesn't do much to fit in with the world and just gets mixed up pretending to be a merchant with literally no desire to sell any of the hundreds of items that were dropped by the massive mob of lizards he killed. Meanwhile he has millions of each currency and somehow in the chaos of the first episode killed a god (which we never actually see happen) and therefore has a metric ton of epic loot, but chooses to do nothing with it. In the meantime he's dealing with his harem of lolis. \nWhich brings me to the real reason I felt the need to write an early review. In eight episodes the MC has stated numerous times that he is, in fact, NOT a lolicon. He is a nearly-30 year old dude in the real world and these literal children are NOT his type. You must be made aware of this, because almost every loli has thrown themself at him and one even tries to get frisky n risky. He has even been quoted as saying \"if you were 14 or 15 years older I might consider\". Which begs the question: why bother having these lolis throw themselves all over him them? He's clearly not interested, sees them as kids to take care of even though he's been reverted back to 15 years old (which is legal adult age in this world because of course it is), and the one woman who is actually OF age he remarks that he'd only be interested in her if she lost 20 kilos because otherwise she's a milf. Gross. Meanwhile he's busy batting off the advances of the lolis and otherwise treating them like children while reminding us that he is, indeed, NOT attracted to them sexually. \nDuring the first few episodes the MC exclaims that he's just going to make the most of his situation, and he's going to explore the world around him and really take in the sights and see what this new world has to offer. By episode eight he still hasn't left the first town he stumbled upon and only just bought himself a carriage to fit all his lolis in. Only when a plot device arrives in the form of a lost elf girl does he actually think about leaving town again and exploring like he said he would six episodes prior. \nAny of the \"fight\" scenes are boring and suspenseless because the MC is so overpowered and perfect there's no reason to be worried about him or the people around him. Because of his near-infinite skill points he can max out every kind of combat skill he even attempts, and thus destroys anything in his path with basically one swipe. \nMingle this in with a very bland day-to-day plot that is painfully stretched with little movement forward, then a rush of plot from episode 6 onward, and it's overall just a meh show. There's nothing mold breaking about it, there's nothing to really set it apart from other game-based isekai, and the characters are at most somewhat likeable, otherwise they're pretty cookie cutter. There's a forced plot with some old play that's being relived, some mumbo about reincarnation in this fantasy world versus being summoned into the world, all of which is very brushed over and the MC barely questions. Even the title is a bit of a misnomer in that the only \"death march\" mentioned was the fact that he, as a game developer, was in the death march before release of two games (when developers often don't leave the office for weeks at a time to make sure they meet deadlines) and otherwise the idea of said death march doesn't play any part in the show. It can't even really be called a plot device because while his working on the games contributed to the game-like nature of his experience in said world, that work doesn't have anything to do with how he got there, and he seems to have no desire to get out.\nAnother gripe is the episode pacing. Each episode ends at a rather awkward spot, and there are times in each one about four minutes before the end credits that would be a really good place to stop at with a decent cliffhanger. But instead it stretches on for another few minutes and cuts off the entire episode in a strange spot story wise. It feels choppy in that aspect, where you'd be satisfied but want more if they'd have cut it off just those few minutes sooner, but instead you get an unsatisfied feeling of something left wildly undone, like a sentence cut midway.\nBefore I sat down to write this review I thought I was mildly enjoying the show, at least enough to keep watching, and if you're not bothered by bland plot that doesn't really go anywhere or the fact that his not-lolicon nature keeps being drilled into your head, it's not necessarily a bad show that no one should watch. It's just not a good show. It's something to watch if you need some filler between seasons of your faves and have watched or dislike everything else, but don't go out of your way to watch it.  I'm not keen on finishing it myself. "}, {"id": 2889, "score": 67, "body": "Synopsis (both seasons, taken from MAL): \n\nSeason 1: It has been 10 years since Heaven's Gate appeared in South America and Hell's Gate appeared in Japan, veiling the once familiar night sky with an oppressive skyscape. Their purposes unknown, these Gates are spaces in which the very laws of physics are ignored. With the appearance of the Gates emerged Contractors, who, in exchange for their humanity, are granted supernatural abilities.\n\nIn the Japanese city surrounding Hell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Gate, Section 4 Chief Misaki Kirihara finds herself at odds with an infamous Contractor codenamed Hei. Called \"Black Reaper\" in the underground world, Hei, like his associates, undertakes missions for the mysterious and ruthless Syndicate while slowly peeling back the dark layers covering a nefarious plot that threatens the very existence of Contractors.\n\nFrom the mind of Tensai Okamura comes a sci-fi thriller taking the form of a subtle expos\u00c3\u00a9 on a war in which political positions and justice have no sway\u00e2\u0080\u0094a war waged exclusively in the shadows.\n\nSeason 2: One night, as meteors streak across the star-studded sky, Shion Pavlichenko becomes a Contractor. Despite her brother's transformation, Shion's twin sister Suou continues to live a fairly ordinary life, attending middle school with her friends and getting caught up in the awkwardness of growing up. However, everything changes when her home is invaded by a masked man cloaked in black, destroying any sense of normality she once had. Revealed to possess latent Contractor abilities of her own, Suou is caught between family, friends, and her own sense of purpose as she ventures into the ruthless world of cutthroats and espionage that Contractors call home.\n\nMeanwhile in Tokyo, investigation surrounding Hell's Gate's sudden collapse is underway, and prophetic signs of doom point in the direction of a silver-haired doll.\n\nStory:\n\nPremise (1 out of 2): DTB's premise revolves around a myriad of narratives that generally fell flat after a few episodes. The scientific atmosphere the show established with the GATE backstory was pretty interesting for a while, but I felt like it never really got emphasized enough until the end of season 1. The \"normal\" narratives found through the police's persecuting the contractors (the name given to the people with unique powers in the show) as well as the contemporary aspects seen during season 2 (e.g. Hei acting as a sort of mentor and father figure to Suou while engaging in ordinary tasks), while relatable, became quite mundane due to how unoriginal and irrelevant it felt. The supernatural premise surrounding the syndicate members was probably the most interesting because of how unique each respective power was; however, I feel like its presence was diminished after season 1 due to the focus on Suou's emotional narrative with both her brother and Hei. Additionally, a heightened focus on Rin's disappearance really jumbled up the second season's focus; I wasn't really able to identify a main premise since it seemed to focus on too many things at once.\n\nPace (1.25 out of 2): The pace of DTB's story considerably shifted after the end of season 1. Season 1 was relatively lethargic, which matched the sort of dark, brooding aesthetic that the season established. I was really able to absorb the somewhat confusing elements of the story due to a slower plot progression, and that really made season 1 better as a result. The second season, due to its shorter length, was slightly faster compared to season one. Therefore, the plot elements, character development, etc. was less detailed and really made the second season more confusing that it should have been.\n\nComplexity (1.25 out of 2): Supernaturally, DTB was a very unique and complex show. The development regarding the powers of each contractor was adequate and the story had some depth to it overall. Once again, season 2 brings the quality down a tad due to its lack of comprehensive storytelling and length. In addition, some aspects, like Amber's involvement in the story, aren't really hashed out compared to something like Hei's backstory/aspirations. Thematically, the show explores themes of the past, future (mainly through the emphasis on stars as a symbol), and other deep metaphors (memory fails me here, so I can't think of anything).\n\nPlausibility (1.5 out of 2): Once again, a supernatural show does not advocate a plausible story as one of its primary components but instead integrates \"smaller\" instances of realism in order to retain some plausibility. DTB does this well overall through the segments that feature characters in an ordinary, contemporary setting since most of the show's story highlights some unnatural phenomena. With these events, we get a better idea of how down to earth the show actually is, and how a supernatural show can still be realistic to some degree. I think DTB succeeds because the interactions are so genuine and don't integrate any sort of unnatural element that lurks behind the scenes. These interactions are simply human. \n\nEnding (1 out of 2): Generally speaking, I thought that each ending was pretty lackluster. My memory really fails me here, so I can't remember every particular aspect of the ending, but I felt pretty disappointed with each one. Season 2's ending was good in wrapping up the story that it established, and season 1 did offer up something that could be built upon (seen in the mini-series), but I didn't really feel satisfied after each one.\n\nOverall rating: 6/10\n\nCharacters:\n\nPresence (1.5 out of 2): From watching both seasons, it seems as if most of the cast is pretty omnipresent throughout. They all seem to develop each episodic plot well (at least in season 1) and impact the show from beginning to end. The minor characters, who usually appear for 1 to 2 episodes, are effective in their delivery of themes and development of more major characters. For example, the scientist with the neat telescope gives us further insight into Hei's interest regarding the starts since his appreciation for Even characters who appear for one scene do contribute to their respective plot; however, some of these contributions were pretty insignificant in retrospect.\n\nPersonality (1.5 out of 2): Since the show exudes a pretty serious atmosphere throughout, the viewer can assume that each character matches this demeanor. However, this does not limit each character's personality to just serious. In fact, most of the main and side cast have memorable, three-dimensional personalities. For example, Kirihara is a character who is known for her strong work ethic and inhuman determination. While these two particular quirks are present throughout the show, she occasionally flaunts her more feminine, friendly side. Hei's aloof and introverted personality dominates in a casual context, yet his more mysterious and merciless side comes out through the Black Reaper. Overall, we see that most of the main cast can be classified through some dominant personality trait (relating to this serious or enigmatic demeanor most of the time) alongside some other traits that might not show up as often, whereas the side cast is relatively one dimensional, which makes sense for an episodic show. Of course, the plot is more linear in the second season, which makes for a more dynamic side cast, but leaves room for flat characters/plot devices (e.g. Suou's blond friend).\n\nBackdrop (2 out of 2): The setting is a relatively dark, depressing, and mysterious city that fits the overall atmosphere of the show. This setting interacts with its characters quite well as it elevates the level of drama and overall darkness that the show already contains. In addition, the darkness flows to each character's personality and therefore adds some sort of mysterious or serious aspect, as previously mentioned. The setting is also important in allowing for the show to establish its themes, as the perpetual darkness might symbolize an underlying evil/bleak future (this, among other themes, are present often, but again I can't remember much since its been 2 months).\n\nDevelopment (1.75 out of 2): The episodic format of season 1 alongside a more linear, cohesive format of season 2 allow for a near-maximum amount of character development to occur. Season 1 allows more characters to develop since each arc is 2 episodes, while season 2 has a smaller cast with characters who can develop over a longer period of time. In both cases, most of the cast develops into a dynamic character as the end of the arc/season approaches. For example, we learn more about Yin, Huang, and Mao as season one comes to a close. I especially appreciated how Huang overcame his ignorance regarding contractors as just tools and sacrificed his life to help them in the final arc of season 1. His story as a whole was very tragic, and I sympathized with him as a result. Yin is a stranger case; you DO learn more about her in both seasons, but her \"development\" is very confusing, for lack of a better term, in season 2. Overall, season 2's character development is pretty mixed, as some characters develop well, while others remain pretty flat and one-dimensional. Suou develops somewhat over the course of season 2, but her development doesn't really become relevant after her defining moment (the fight with the trench coat contractor). I believe the ending just brings her back to whoever she was at the start of the show (I might be mis-remembering here, so forgive me). \n\nCatharsis (.75 out of 2): Because of the numerous amount of contractors, DBT is a show that is pretty much devoid of any catharsis. As a whole, the show does not prominently feature any sentimental expression and instead places more emphasis on the mystery and drama surrounding the story and its characters. Of course, using devoid would be hyperbole especially considering how the immense amount of character development in characters like Huang led to some catharsis; however, I really sensed little emotion throughout season 1. Season 2 was definitely more emotional, especially with the inclusion of a younger character in Suou as well as an older Hei in a sort of father role; the conflict they went through during her training was incredibly realistic. In addition, the punk and the obviously traumatized dad's relationship was filled with incredible amounts of sadness that you would definitely see in a relationship without a mother present. In short, it makes up for what season 1 did not deliver on, but it wasn't enough to balance it out.\n\nOverall rating: 7.5/10\n\nAesthetics (artstyle):\n\nGeneral (1 out of 2): The art style in DTB pretty lackluster. It is an older show, so I cannot discredit it that much. The action scenes are very fluid and very nice to look out. The overall atmosphere/tone of the show (dark, brooding) was established to perfection with the dark color palette and harsh, jagged imagery, which allows for the show's mysterious narrative to establish itself immediately. It has that Cowboy Bebop feel, but it doesn't have the extravagance that Bebop brings with the constantly changing environment.\n\nCharacters (1.25 out of 2): The characters, for the most part, have pretty unique designs. Hei and Kirihara are pretty generic, and some of the side characters in season 2 were relatively boring in terms of design (e.g. blond chick again). Hei's design does get better after season 1, as his scruffy, older, and fatigued appearance signifies his transition from young, hardworking contractor to apathetic alcoholic. Aside from that, nothing really changes into something significant; it all remains relatively consistent and generic.\n\nBackgrounds (2 out of 2): The backgrounds of each scene really contribute to the overall atmosphere of the show. Most of the scenes occur with no glaring distractions as to emphasize the seriousness of each scene; they want you to focus on what's going on. These screens are particularly dark in order to emphasize the mystery surrounding the plot. While some viewers might find it boring to look at, it was much easier to focus on what was really going on during each particular scene.\n\nAnimation (.5 out of 2): While the backgrounds bring out the best things of the show, the animation comes off as really calm and uninteresting. The action scenes are fluid and engaging, but the rest of the action doesn't really grab your attention. Some other scenes do look beautiful, but it seems as if the show is definitely focused more on its still images.\n\nVisual effects (1 out of 2): Much like the animation, the visual effects don't really stand out. There are some pretty spectacular moments which look absolutely magnificent, but its not consistent enough to be considered good (instead of below average).\n\nOverall score: 5.75/10\n\nAesthetics (sound):\n\nVoice acting (3 out of 3): I really loved the voice acting in this show. Once again, I think the subtle tones for characters like Yin and Hei really matched up with the overall tone of the show. With the action, the voices became incredibly dramatic and fit the tense tone that accompanied the scene. Other tones, like Suou's, were fitting for her immaturity regarding her newer role as a contractor and an adolescent girl. Hei's exhausted delivery, among other things that were previously mentioned, really indicated how he has transformed as an individual. Overall, the voices were fitting and really enunciated the seriousness of the show.\n\nMusic (3.5 out of 4) Most of the music was incredibly fitting for a show this bleak and mysterious. The opening for season 1 was nice, a nice mix of harsh and calm tones to suggest mystery with a side of action and drama. While it was fitting, I wouldn't say it was great. The music found in the anime pretty much follows the same formula. The second season's opening was more lighthearted compared to the first, which makes sense considering how emotional the sequel season was compared to the first. Once again, the same can be said for the music in the anime. The endings are good as well.\n\nSound effects (2 out of 3): Sound effects were great. Nothing too jarring. Sounded great overall and really gave an extra \"umph\" to the action scenes. My memory (not to mention I didn't pay much attention to the sound effects) really inflates this rating, but I can't really recall something that was really bad.\n\nOverall rating: 8.5/10\n\nEnjoyment:\n\nArt (.5 out of 1): Pretty much what I said in the aesthetic section. I enjoyed some of it, while other aspects weren't particularly interesting or enjoyable.\n\nSound (1.5 out of 2 points): I enjoyed listening to the music and sound effects. Complaints stem from issues listed in the aesthetics sound section.\n\nOverall (4 out of 7): When it comes down to it, season 1 was absolutely fantastic, whereas season 2 was a complete flop. The plot and its respective elements were somewhat interesting and engaging, and I was genuinely interested in the backstories for most characters. I enjoyed keeping up with each character and stayed attentive to how they developed over time. The aesthetics really established a mysterious narrative that kept me engaged; the smaller details (e.g. no distractions in background to make focal point the discussion/event) really show how complex the season was. In contrast, the second season's plot was absolutely mundane and mildly uninteresting. While I did enjoy watching how the relationship between Hei and Suou developed, most of the other characters were either bland or didn't show up as much as I had wanted them to (i.e. other contractors). The mysterious tone that was established by the first season was replaced with a more emotional one, which, in my opinion, was somewhat drastic considering how good the tone of the first season was. On a more positive note, the music, animation, and sound got a decent upgrade from season 1 to 2, so I particularly enjoyed the aesthetics all the way through. \n\nOverall, I thought it was nice. I'd say I moderately enjoyed it. The flaws were sort of significant in lowering the show's quality, so I didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to. On a enjoyment scale, I'd rate it adequate.\n\nOverall rating: 6/10\n\nSummary:\n\nWhile the show does so many great things in terms of tone and engagement, the flaws that are found throughout (mostly in season 2) really prevented me from enjoying the show wholeheartedly. Casually, I would definitely recommend it. However, a more critical watcher would probably stop watching after the end of the 1st season. I'll probably watch the OVA mini-series, but that'll probably be in the distant future. \n\nWeeb note: I love Yin; she's cute. No Misaka though. Suou is nice too. Very cute. Would headpat and protecc.\n\nTotal rating: 6.75/10\nWould I recommend?: Only casually. More critical watchers should only watch the first season and the OVA mini-series.\n\n"}, {"id": 2899, "score": 60, "body": "Darling in the Franxx sure was something. By the end of the show, it felt like a whole completely new series from how it started. Franxx is an anime about a post-apocalyptic future where children pilot robots known as FRANXX to fight of these monsters known as Klaxosaurs. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pretty interesting concept and that makes for a good story. Hiro and Zero Two are the protagonists of this story and they are interesting characters as well. Hiro is a boy who wants to pilot a Franxx but is unable to for some reason. Zero Two is a Franxx pilot who is half human half Klaxosaur and everyone is scared of her except Hiro who from the start, is mesmerized by her. The story is there, and it has some pretty solid characters at first glance and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a decent plot, but it just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t play out to its full potential. Much of it is wasted. The first few episodes are good with the story progressing really nice. Hiro meets Zero Two, we get introduced to the other characters, Zero Two and Hiro grow closer and then they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re finally allowed to pilot a Franxx together.\n\n Episode 13 (Young Hiro and 02 ep I think) felt like the peak of this show and had me believe that things were going really well, and they were until the show reached the backstory explanation of how the world these characters are living in came to be. It just felt like lazy writing. I feel like it could have been more interesting instead of \"APE just popped out of nowhere and took control over the world\" and \"The Klaxosaurs just invaded one day and fucked everyone over\". What made the show good to me was the lore of the story and the mystery of what occurred in the past. After everything was explained, I felt disappointed. It was lazy and rushed.\n\nOnce we reached the final episodes of Franxx, the pacing just became even worse. VIRM just popped out of nowhere, and then the next episode they were in space. The producers could've taken their time to develop this part of the story and it could've even been used for a second season. Characters which at first seemed good became generic quickly. The whole Mitsuru and Kokoro relationship was out of place and did not develop the story at all. I was expecting some nice action, yeah character development is good but what does wanting to have a baby have to do with the damn story. Jesus Christ go get your own anime. Ikuno is a character I would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve liked to see get some development, but she was pretty much irrelevant the entire series. The story would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve honestly been the same without her in it. The Nines were also irrelevant and forgettable. I would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve forgotten about Nana and that other dude if they hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t survived to tend. \n\nOne good thing I can say is that the action scenes in this show were pretty great. It looked crisp and clean. The music was also good. Kinda felt like some Attack on Titan type tracks. Was this series good? It was okay. It was messy and clich\u00c3\u00a9 but despite its issues, it was pretty enjoyable and had some beautiful scenes. I mean my enjoyment went downhill once we hit the second arc of the story, but I enjoyed the first half. Finale was eh. I like nice happy endings, so I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind it. It was generic though. This anime had so much potential and would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve honestly been something great if the producers would have just taken their time to develop the story more and make it orderly instead of just rushing and having a big mess.\n"}, {"id": 2901, "score": 63, "body": "~~~img(https://i.imgur.com/ULJhs6F.png)~~~\n# ~~~__Spoiler-free review__~~~\n<n></n>\n# Review in brief:\n\nSeason 1 of Log Horizon presents a truly faithful rendition of the \"trapped in an MMO\" setting and provides an interesting story to go with it but suffers from slow progression and predictability. Your enjoyment will hinge on how well you stay immersed in the world of Elder Tale and while this anime does a good job of getting you to enter there's no guarantee that it will hold you in.\n\n# Review in full:\n\nWhen it comes to engagement, Log Horizon places heavy focus on just one aspect: immersion. It wants you to enter its world, explore both its realms and game-like mechanics, experience the cultures of the pre-existing NPCs and the newly trapped gamers, and ultimately feel like you're on an adventure in the world of Elder Tale yourself. This is accomplished quite well. Right from the get-go the characters realize that they must use the mechanics of the game (including classes, cool-down abilities, and now-telepathic voice chat) to thrive, but they are all still gamers at heart and also start developing new strategies to handle everything from cooking to spell-casting.\n\nWhile this is going on there are bigger implications that are explored in a game world made real. What happens when NPCs are no longer just walking dialogue boxes but living, breathing beings? Or when magic is no longer just game code and becomes a real form of energy? Even politics and the economy become major issues as time goes on. Being trapped in a video game isn't just a gimmick or plot device in Log Horizon, it's the very essence of everything it is and does.  Together with the well-established setting (which is continuously being fleshed out) it creates the captivating sense that the story is much bigger than just what we see the characters going though.  Even when Log Horizon wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enjoyable for me, this sense gave me reason to believe that something more was just an episode away.\n\n~~~img(https://i.imgur.com/2jwQR1T.gif)\n_Maybe I just have a high tolerance for CG?  I could see this being a video game._~~~\n\nAs far as production values go, the animation does a great job of displaying both the world and the video game elements without either looking out of place.  This is including the CG, as even though it stands out compared to the animation at times it still feels like it belongs in the context of how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being used. The familiar yet fantastical designs of the environments and the characters also do a remarkable job of making it all feel like its own world as well as its own game, cultivating strong visual immersion to complement its narrative immersion. Meanwhile the music, sound effects, and voice-work (I watched in Japanese) is good (but not great) all around.  It does its job and there isn't anything to complain about but not much of it is memorable either (aside from the oddly catchy OP).\n\nSadly, beyond that Log Horizon's presentation transforms the story from an intricate exercise in how a world can be built from the mechanics that drive it into a lazy shounen adventure adaptation where the premise is only used as a hook to get you to watch the next episode each week. It's as though the story is being held hostage by the producers, demanding that you watch more than what's necessary to continue.  This is largely due to the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slow progression.  It's not much of an issue early on since there's initially quite a bit that the anime has to and does explain, but after the first third of the season it finds itself with too little to explain to justify the pace and starts spacing itself out instead.\n\nAfter the world is established each subsequent arc features a barrage of recaps, which not only include the typical beginning-of-the-episode refreshers but also many mid-episode reminders, cues, and hints; so many in fact that by the time each arc comes to a head so many hints have been dropped that you know how the arc ends before it even reaches a climax, destroying the dramatic build-up of tension the intricate story naturally contains.  It's like reading a good book next to an acquaintance who is constantly asking if you've reached the next big spoilery event, with no attempt to mask the spoiler itself.  These are then interlaced with so much shallow comedy (especially with the pervert jokes and ship-teases that you'd have to be blind to not see coming) and boring filler (such as pointless side plots and clearly one-sided battles) that it all takes up more time than the serious moments that progress the plot.  Everything that actually matters could have been covered in 13 episodes with room to spare, but Log Horizon doesn't trust its viewers to understand or remember anything that takes more than two sentences to explain.\n\n~~~img630(https://i.imgur.com/z3vlYmQ.png)\n_Beach episode?  Check.  Culture festival episode?  Check.  Wait, what do you mean this isn't a school anime?_~~~\n\nIn addition, while Log Horizon's characters are utilized well by the story, the characters themselves are mostly nothing special. The majority of them fill a role, perform that role, and nothing more, while most of the rest don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even manage that. Development and backstories beyond a few bullet-points (predictable clich\u00c3\u00a9s included) are for but a select few characters. You'll likely find two or three of them to be particularly interesting, but many of them are easily forgettable. There is even a plot development tied to the game's XP system that offers a great opportunity to take a closer look at the characters in that moment before things change for them, but nothing substantial was done with it and it passed with just a brief mention. It also doesn't help that there's very little that is able to challenge them. The fact that the trapped gamers are overpowered even becomes a plot point, though again it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s merely stated rather than addressed. Regardless it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help that few characters have any real reason to develop when all they have to do is listen to Shiroe for everything to turn out okay (or if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re one of the handful of cookie-cutter villains, wait for Shiroe to defeat them because they had no chance to win in the first place).\n\n# Verdict:\n\nLog Horizon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first season could have easily been great, in fact it definitely was for the first third, but its faults severely damage the majority of the show.  Even then I could almost still say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good because underneath all of the mindless filler & overused tropes lies an interesting concept, quality production values, and the beginnings of an amazing plot.  Unfortunately, the product as a whole just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t entertaining or intricate enough to cope with its faults.  I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recommend Log Horizon to a general audience, though if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a big fan of isekai or anime about video games you may find enough to enjoy here to make it all worthwhile."}, {"id": 2903, "score": 67, "body": "~~~img840(https://i.imgur.com/Z3nzUWK.jpg)~~~\n__This Review Contains No Spoilers__\nDisclaimer:~!The following review is my personal opinion, how I experienced and thought about the anime Uma Musume. It is not an attempt to convey objective facts, as one would find in a report, on the contrary, it is my opinion and how I think about the anime, it is purely subjective, not less and not more.!~\n\n~~~img600(https://i.imgur.com/24aZBhj.jpg)~~~\n\n__Story__\nThe main plot is nothing completely new but the horse-girl aspect and the rivalries were entertaining, and, in their best moments, even dramatic. The humor felt sometimes off, especially when it relied on the team-members: They felt gimmicky and tacked-on until much later in the anime where they finally got the chance to establish a relation with the viewer, but this was too little too late. The direction and series-composition put on the shoes before the pants, in this regard. The races themselves were well-staged, created proper excitement, and were often the highlight of each episode. One aspect I could neither understand nor accept though, until the very end, was the performing-of-a-song aspect after each race: It never received proper attention to justify its existence in the story, aside from episode 2, and it also made no sense whether we compare it to reality, where such a thing doesn't exist in horse-racing, or to what we learned from the Uma Musume universe itself: The girls are professional athletes, they train running, every day, and nothing else, that's their profession, singing and dancing is not part of their training, and yet the story expects them to be able to sing and dance on a professional level. Try to make sense of that. Hint: It doesn't make any sense at all. Speaking about not making sense, it could be argued that there are no antagonists in Uma Musume, for even the leader of the rival team is begrudgingly supporting our girls and our team. Were we to judge them as actual antagonists, we would not find much antagonizing about them, which was disappointing and leads us to an overall 6.5/10.\n~~~img600(https://i.imgur.com/EzQ6ss5.jpg)~~~\n\n__Characters__\nThe main character may be steeped in various cliches but has, despite that, enough individuality, visually and in terms of personality, in order to be recognizable in the vast sea of anime characters. There is also an interesting dynamic between the two main characters, which, for the most part, is carrying the main plot. Among the supporting characters, the team-members of Special Week (the name of our main character) feel flat, in their best moments, and slightly aggravating, in their worst moments. They could have added to the anime if a little bit more attention and time in the spotlight would have been dedicated to them. This actually does happen towards the end of the anime, but, as previously mentioned, it is too little too late. The rival horse-girls though are diverse, memorable, and entertaining enough to justify an overall score of 7.5/10.\n~~~img600(https://i.imgur.com/Fwb4F8L.jpg)~~~\n\n__Visuals__\nThe character designs are quirky, tasteful, and covered with numerous lovely details. The attention to detail is also noticeable if we check out the backgrounds, the props (_carrots, carrots, carrots_), the outfits, and hair accessories of the girls. The designers did a great job in this regard. Some horse-girls though lack a little bit of visual individuality, and can be hard to tell apart until later on. That may also be attributed to the sheer number of girls which the viewer has to become familiar with. The visual quality is slightly above average with the odd scene and background here and there dropping in quality while the horse-girls themselves are well drawn, but not enough to warrant an overall Very Good rating: 7.5/10.\n~~~img600(https://i.imgur.com/s5G9HNO.jpg)~~~\n\n__Audio__\nI experienced serious issues with the sound-mix where effects (steps, ringing, doors) and background noises (crowd cheering) were twice as loud as they are supposed to be, which made for a dangerous and unpleasant experience with headphones. This actually stopped being an issue from episode 9 and onward, but such a blunder can simply not be defended. The soundtrack is mostly invisible, which doesn't have to be an issue for music that is meant to stay primarily in the background, but there were, with a few exceptions, almost no noteworthy moments at all. In the end, it managed to be below average, and that is quite an achievement in itself. The opening song is unremarkable too and leaves us with a scent of no-risk, no originality, but the ending song makes up for it with a nice melody that is actually catchy and well-fitting: 5/10.\n~~~img600(https://i.imgur.com/58TJpAF.jpg)~~~\n\n__Enjoyment__\nDespite the flaws and letdowns with story and sound, I enjoyed most of my time with Uma Musume: The charm of the main characters, paired with the cute visuals, managed to overshadow many shortcomings: 7/10.\nyoutube(https://youtu.be/nuuq0Ul_-_c)\n\n__Summary__\nA weak start was followed by a surprising sprint, but Uma Musume ran out of breath and missed a spot on the podium by several horse-lengths: __6.7__ - Fun, but not winning any trophies.\n~~~img600(https://i.imgur.com/sVdQfFa.jpg)~~~\n\n<br><br>Afterword: ~!My rating is not based on my own abilities and skills to produce anime, but it is relative to all the other anime I was privileged enough to watch and enjoy so far. I believe that a creator is always above the critic: It takes not only skill and dedication in order to create, but, above all, courage, whereas it takes no bravery to judge the work of someone else. In this sense, the effort it took to write this review is, despite the rating, a way of expressing my humble admiration.!~"}, {"id": 2917, "score": 53, "body": "img(https://orig00.deviantart.net/a4ac/f/2018/190/e/8/tokyo_ghoul_root_a_score_banner_by_overpowered99-dcgsh1o.png)\n\nTokyo Ghoul \u00e2\u0088\u009aA decided it would be acceptable to slash away the good elements found in the first season. I can say that you're probably a deranged ghoul if you thought such a thing was a great decision. Now here we are, looking at this pile of mess we call the second season. Without a doubt, it has become a depressing scene that'll make you say \"What a bummer\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nTo describe this season, it's a lot less of the solid psychological massacre from the first season and more of a lousy breather to expand on the world of ghouls and humans. Or actually, breather might not the best term to describe it knowing that the majority of its potential was ruined. Yeah, it's more of a suffocating gas. You tried hard to breathe, tried as much as you can to understand and care about what's happening in the narrative, but the gas turned you into doziness and confusion. Shifting the spotlight away from the ghouls of Anteiku towards the bigger groups from both sides, the CCG and Aogiri, is a key factor that contributes to the poor execution as a whole. The appearance of many characters while lacking the knowledge needed to know their role feels really pointless in the grand scheme of things. They appear to fight and talk, and well, that's pretty much it. Introducing all these characters with little explanation or minimal context is a turf where questions arise. Why is everything happening? Who are you? What just happened? Even for existing characters, particularly Kaneki and Touka, they too suffer from this mess, getting downplayed into characters who leave a phantom trail behind. Along with the jumbled up pacing, the story turns into a disconnected piece deprived of coherence. It's not good for what should have been a multidimensional world mixed with ghouls and humans. Short glimmers of backstory are not enough to expand on things. Small dialogues that come and go can only give us a gist off their relationships, but that's not enough to be impactful when they die or mourn. Investment is never there in the first place. A lot of plot elements are hanging at the end, barren and abandoned in the midst of everything.\n\nIf the story and character bring things down, then it's up to the art and sound to score a few points. And well, at least the audiovisual is better when it comes to presenting enjoyment. The muddied up colors of purple and red bring in a depressing tone, fitting the miserable state this anime consistently spews out. I'm not saying that in a bad way because it did refine how the characters feel with how much they were surrounded by violence and darkness. Of course they'll find themselves fighting each other quite a lot. However, a lot of the fights feel awkward with lacklusting choreography and drawn out attacks. Connected loosely together with the narrative, the miniscule amount of tension packs little impact and serves only to show clashes with no motives. Thankfully, from the climax thereon, the fighting animation becomes an improvement, somewhat increasing excitement towards the end. While the characters may be empty inside, their outside appearance is a shell giving off prominent coolness. We have the ghouls with their menacing looks bursting with predation and the folks of CCG equipped with their titanic armors and weapons. It's not lying to say these fights have a badass side to them, especially when they were backed up by good soundtracks. Sentimentality floats in the air with the atmosphere reeking despair for both sides. It's not a fight that comes without consequences, and the deaths and grieves the characters face complement with the music. Deep trembling of orchestral music is truly some powerful stuff. As for the insert songs, they have a profound feeling of emptiness which matches the hollow story. It's weird, but them playing is kind of ironic knowing they're probably meant to be emotional, not insubstantial. Just like the visual, the sound didn't fix much in the end anyway as it becomes an individual piece of enjoyment rather than a balanced whole with the narrative.\n\nIt's such a shame how Tokyo Ghoul \u00e2\u0088\u009aA decided to scrap away numerous aspects, degrading a lot of things from interesting all the way down to meaningless. It's a season where I could only grasp the surface of what's going on, and that's not going to do anything good to my enjoyment, safe for a couple of episodes. What a bummer.\n"}, {"id": 2927, "score": 67, "body": "So after watching this anime I can safely say this: Much like movies such as Face Off with Nicholas Cage or The Room by Tommy Wiseau, Mirai Nikki specializes in the art of being so bad it's actually kind of amazing\n\nEverything about this series is insane to the tenth degree and that's thankfully what makes it so enjoyable: It knows it's beyond fucking stupid but the whole anime plays out like it's aware of that fact and just says \"if we're not gonna make sense then we're gonna have shit tons of fun not making sense\" and that's essentially what I got out of this series \n\nThe premise: What can I say it's every death game competition story you've seen before but what does distinguish it is that the characters are just having such a blast with playing this game and that's where the bulk of the enjoyment for me came from is that I was just having such a fun time watching these people act like total raving lunatics\n\nAnd just to be fair as insanely over the top and Horrendously entertaining as Future Diary is I actually will give one legitimate criticism that for every over the top insane moment there are just as many dull and boring moments and episodes that make you just wanna get back to the over the top stupidity but on the plus side those are few and far between and don't take much time to switch gears\n\nNow where do I stand on recommendations of this series? Well unless you haven't been paying attention  the recommendation criteria is pretty simple: If your looking for a balls to the wall fun ass time anime without having to think too hard then this is the anime for you. \n\nOf course if you're going in expecting a life changing story with deep and complex characters I assure you are NOT gonna get it here and if you are hoping for that stuff then might I re-direct you towards Death Note or anything in the Fullmetal Alchemist Series, hell I'd even argue Assassination Classroom for as goofy as it is will give you more depth with its characters and story\n\nBut again if you are coming in expecting to see something over that's over the top stupid with how entertaining it is then you'll definitely enjoy this.

To LOVE-Ru is full-on packed with all kinds of ecchi goodies, crammed tightly into a bundle of filler-esque stories to bring in humor, a bit of romance, and quite a handful of bored annoyance at your side.\n\nLike I said before, the story is pretty much how one would define what fillers are. Simple episodes that are not related to the main sci-fi story introduced earlier on in the anime. Which is not a bad thing in hindsight, but for a mindless entertainment of this nature, To LOVE-Ru didn't do that good of a job in achieving that goal for the most part. There are a lot of repetition. Let me repeat that again. There are simply too much repetition for the show to be a fun one. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the reason why I was amused by the first half but as time goes on, I found myself getting annoyed with the recurrence, whether it's jokes or actions, because it won't work if you've seen it multiple times. Nevertheless, there are a few episodes I did enjoy as I found myself laughing at the silly things that happened with the characters. As for them, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pleasing to see that the main boy isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as annoying as I thought he would be. In fact, he kind of stray away from the major denseness found in other leads who happen to be in the same situation as him, although a couple of similarities are still present. The group of girls are likable, having personalities that are different enough to each other. However, only a couple of them are blessed with enough screen time so I didn't feel too much about the ones who are barely there this season.\n\nNothing much to be said in the arts department except for the fact that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty much as simple as the story. A modern take on the looks of the art style in the past. Consistency is maintained with the use of bright colors matching the energetic aura from the characters. Though for the animation, at times it feels dull which didn't really help with the mostly boring story. There are exaggerations in the comedy and ecchi scenes, as to be expected in an anime containing a lot of silliness. With fanservice, it should be unprecedented that the designs of the characters are quite proportional, including their eyes too which reach big but not big enough to look weird. Cute I'd say, especially with their clothing as it complements well with the personality of each characters. Same goes for the voice acting though it did take a bit of time to get used with some. While there are no notable soundtracks that I remembered, it did remove any distractions that could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve possibly ruined some of the humors so that's a good thing. And for the opening and ending songs, they have a charming but hot attitude that fit the tone of the anime if that makes any sense at all.\n\nTo LOVE-Ru in the end served as an entertainment that only show and doesn't tell any progression of the story or characters. In a sense, it's just a montage of attempted humors combined with a sexy atmosphere that worked for half of the time. Do not try to find any deeper meaning in this anime and just watch it at face value. This ecchi trial of harem is awaiting you.\n"}, {"id": 2940, "score": 60, "body": "~~~img840(https://i.imgur.com/heNbbv5.jpg)~~~\n__Review May Not Only Contain Spoilers but It Is Also Purely Subjective__\n<br>\n~~~img600(https://i.imgur.com/LbM7aV9.jpg)~~~\n__Story__\nThe moment DarliFra stopped focusing on its main-romance to carry the plot, led by a notorious femme fatale, but rather chose to sidetrack and destroy a plot that it had so carefully built, was when it transformed from possibly great to almost embarrassingly awful.\n\nIn general, I do not understand why the story had so many subplots that added nothing to it overall. Focusing on its most interesting plot would have spared us most of the shallowness, clich\u00c3\u00a9s, and bad writing that resulted from this blundering change in narrative.\n\nInstead of getting to experience an ending that would be equally great we were led into alleys and dead ends that were resolved by deus ex machina: 4.5/10\n\n~~~img600(https://i.imgur.com/KOfvjkU.jpg)~~~\n__Characters__\nZero Two was the star of the season, drawing countless viewers to DarliFra, but her excellent design was wasted as the story did not know where to go. Yet I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure we will continue to see her images posted indefinitely, regardless of how un- or successful DarliFra by and of itself will be.\n\nThe rest of the cast consists of Hiro, who usually manages to come through in the end against all odds and hardships, the bossy and meddlesome Ichigo, and a bunch of fillers who were needed for the story but are ultimately not worth mentioning or remembering when we look at how careless the story was treated overall and in the end.\n\nI also disliked how weak the children (that's how our group is addressed by others) behaved when they met with adversity. I understand that they were quite na\u00c3\u00afve as they were kept in the dark on purpose about many things, and even were duped, but the magnitude of their helplessness and the impotence displayed by the group, notably with social interactions but also with independent thinking, was seriously infuriating.\n\nWhile all that may have been so by design, I cannot perceive it as a success when the final result was frustration. This also had the effect that clashes and fights within the group lacked credibility, and with no plausibility for them, the drama was often murdered before it managed to take its very first breath: 5.5/10\n\n~~~img600(https://i.imgur.com/RI5z8Jf.jpg)~~~\n__Visuals__\nThe previously mentioned great design is not only true for our MC but also for all the other children, at least in terms of visual design: Each child had a visibly distinct look that telegraphed his or her character.\n\nOther points where the anime excelled were close-up expressions and emotions: Visual quality made a big jump whenever a close-up was on display. Scenes with wider areas or less zoom, though, made the lack of details apparent.\n\nThe design of the mechas was unique. Some people rejected the looks strongly while others liked their warm faces and eyes. I felt neither the first nor the latter, and they did not impress me either way, but some mechas were rather bad-looking.\n\nThe enemies and monsters, however, with their primitive shapes, forms, and colors, made me think of a different anime: Kemono Friends, which is not flattering: 6.5/10\n\n~~~img600(https://i.imgur.com/zgL4wLF.jpg)~~~\n__Audio__\nI have been listening to the soundtrack, and to the release of the opening song, for over a month continuously. It can survive comparisons with most known anime-soundtracks and can also compete with known film or gaming soundtracks. While it cannot keep up the quality of writing for all its compositions, it does include some outstanding pieces. It could almost be said that DarliFra was undeserving of its good soundtrack, but that would be a disservice to some of its strongest scenes where the soundtrack played an important and underlining role.\n\nThe opening song has become a favorite and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m praising it at least just as much. Kiss of Death, its name, was produced by Hyde (a legend of the Japanese rock scene) and performed by Mika Nakashima, a name that may sound familiar to some. It was no coincidence that great things came to be when these two reunited.\n\nThe ending song, though not on the same level, manages to keep the quality high, and it is worth mentioning that it was performed by the entire female cast: 8/10\n\nyoutube(https://youtu.be/Zdd_6mf_Na4)\n\n__Enjoyment__\nI enjoyed it a lot in the first half and resolved to ignore what bothered me for the sake of what I already had seen, but had I known where everything was going...: 5.5/10\n\n~~~img600(https://i.imgur.com/A1IVkYh.jpg)~~~\n__Summary__\nWhat I will take away from DarliFra is the good soundtrack and the great opening song. Plus, a few memories of what could have been: __6__"}, {"id": 2953, "score": 56, "body": "School Days is not your typical harem, romance, and drama anime. Instead, this one freaking anime is one of the most mental test, psychology, yet satisfying at least at the end. This anime is not your happy theme anime, at least on the first impressions, and some people assume that this is one of the worst anime they've ever seen. Honestly, for me, School Days is not included in such a type and people only see just from one point of view. But I also admit that this is also the worst of all. After all, I think this anime is a big lesson for all of us especially male if friendship is a seed if you deal too far. First of all, this is an old recommendation from my friends. Said the one that this is just an ordinary anime, a typical good romance at the beginning. However, everyone has experienced such things and almost all estimate it that this is a recommendation from someone who just being a troll to you.\n\nSchool Days has a premise that seems simple and initially, the story shows a mediocre romance story. From the beginning too, the story will move into a love triangle where it will end up that one person will be able to. School Days follows the lives of these three teenagers: Makoto, Kotonoha, and Sekai. They have a daily life like a high schooler in general and hang out with each other. But instead, you'll don't know the conclusion unless you have to get through it one by one and see how satisfied you are when you see the ending. You'll laugh like an insane person in your mind. This anime has a complex relationship story than any other romance. It takes a lesson on how a person sees the \"woman\" as his toys, uses it as a pleasant passion, and takes an impression on the stereotypical of the envy, betrayal, an untouchable. In a nutshell, it might be a bit like a bad guy who arises from a good guy. There is some term like \"curiosity\" or being young memories. But if you're being a douchebag all the times, you have to be careful because you've awakened the dark side of a human, a pure innocent into a sociopath, a jealous psychopath, and you endure the consequences and regret for the rest of your life which it ends to your death. I think this is one of the anime that should be analyzed if a child goes into the puberty phase and as a parent, they should be able to teach their child \"sex education\" in a short way so that the child has to know how to control his or her lust and emotion in the public. Now, this is getting too serious because I wanted to make a rant but this is becoming a serious issue. Damn, that escalated quickly.\n\nThe art is the worst of all. Although I don't mean to criticize the animation because this is a classic (not too) anime, at least Baccano! is the one who can prove it and put a lot of effort even though both anime is aired at the same season. The animation for the character is worse and so poorly, leaving a bad impression just by seeing it for one episode. The body animation that often changes with their size, keyframes that are not smooth enough like watching a movie with bad frames-per-second, and the detail is decent and very explanatory for real. Some of the frames, or the whole, look like watching Battlefield Earth where you have to turn your head so that your head and eyes are not injured. The rest, the animation is not as good as the anime that TNK adapted on besides School Days. Everything in here is just impressed.\n\nThe soundtrack, the theme songs, and the voice action are decent. Not too much that I want criticism, in this case, not very good but also not too bad. Sometimes, I find that the soundtrack is pretty mellow, dramatic, and meaningful where it fits with the moments. The theme songs are decent, all of them although not just one that's used primarily in the ending. Bottom line, it's all decent and nothing I judge anymore.\n\nThere are three main characters in this series, the rest of them is being a pointless and not very important. First of all, we'll focus on one of the most hated anime characters in the community, Makoto Itou. Makoto is no different from Shou Tucker, these two characters are the most douchebag characters ever. Now, I do not want to make a list of anime characters that I hate the most because I just look like someone who is too emotionally when enjoying some fiction. For Makoto, I think he is the one that has the realistic character that ever existed. He's a sociopath, having a sex with all his friends, more concerned with his desires than his feelings, douchebag, selfish, uncaring, and you can also add your favorite swear words. I think there is no obvious reason for this character if you've been watching this anime. In a nutshell, he is a metaphor as people who are more concerned with his lust. Sekai is one of the characters that has a metaphor for people who are envious and manipulative. You think Izaya Orihara takes the cake? Orochimaru? Light Yagami? or Lelouch Lamperouge? Well, take a look at this character. At least, the characters I mentioned have various reasons why they become a manipulator. In contrast to Sekai which is no different from Makoto. Sekai has a destructive characteristic about relationships, a concept of jealousy, so she can't trust her own feeling. Basically, she is a description of a character that begins everything, which makes Makoto become a douchebag, which makes Kotonoha an insane person. One word to describe her is a 'hypocrite'. The last main character is Kotonoha, a pure innocent girl who carried away into a complex relationship that ended with horror and terror. Some of her personality is pretty annoying as she feels angry when Makoto with other women, but I think it can be tolerated. I just can not think why in the hell of the world does Kotonoha want to sacrifice her body with a douchebag? In the end, she ends up with a dead inside until it ends with a sunset moment on a yacht. You know, what am I thinking.\n\nWell, School Days is a type of anime that I love and hate at the same time. I love it because sometimes emotional yet satisfaction at the same times. In addition, it teaches you one of the important education of never becoming a douchebag unless you can take the consequences. On the other hand, I also hate for the same reason for everyone who has been watching it. There is some of the symbolism, literal, or depth meaning about this show. This is not just an anime you watched it and angry at the end but there is something that stuck between the good meaning yet bad shows. It's like you watching 2001: A Space Odyssey where you think first, what does this film mean or you just jump to conclusions for failing to understand the story. This is like watching Requiem For A Dream about what if someone drowns into drug addiction. Just like this show, teaches you about how a person falls into sex addiction. It's very hard to be able to bear in this anime because it needs a bit of mentally that not everyone can watch this. Some dropped it, some did not wanna watch it, and some haven't watched it but didn't want to watch it because of spoilers or other reasons. But, why there are still people who want to watch it if you already know from the beginning? Because it's so bad it's good.\n\nDo School Days deserve into the worst anime ever? I think it depends on the viewers just whether you take the positives, don't want to remember it for those who've watched it, or just make it as your fap material. I mean, some make it as itself. I'm being honest in here. School Days is not entirely bad but not completely perfect. In fact, it's either. It has a great plot twist I've ever seen in the romance anime, deflecting a bit of a harem genre, not your typical slice of life happy charming anime, the plot is too realistic yet dark, and has a decent soundtrack. There are many characters that are pointless which means there is no real reason to talk about. The art is bad, which means it's even worse. On the other hand, some people assume this is the worst anime they've ever seen because they just view from the other side or just hears from others. However, if you want to test your psychology or want to let your anger, just watch School Days instead of some psychological or thriller stuff. \"Just two of us,\" who know that."}, {"id": 2969, "score": 55, "body": "This will be a quick overview on this show. So ill give my general statements on it. A more detailed one may appear at some point in the future. I wont give a synopsis cause there's already one provided. Spoilers ahead so be warned. With that out of the way, grab a seat. let's have a chat. \n\n*Infinite Ryvius OST- nowhere plays*\n\nFull metal panic tries its best to mix an overarching militaristic plot with SOL comedy antics. However the later is a lot more poorly handled than the former. I will say this, it can potentially be a way for us to delve in the dysfunctional psychosis of our protag and also have him endear us to those around him, but not only are the jokes generally unfunny(only about two ever are) and are too big and overplayed to the point where it somewhat undermines his plight and also the lengths where this show wants you to take it seriously when it decides to not be grounded by reality. One minute its metal gear solid, the next Ranman 1/2. Couple that with the school cast being generally simplistic and cliche compared to the guys over at the Tuathe de Dana and you have a show that mostly has somewhat of an identity crisis. Which is especially disheartening seeing as how this is the shows MAIN SELLING POINT. It would be better if that stuff was a bit more downplayed, the jokes were more clever/subtle, and if it was coupled with clever dialogue to helps us get endeared to the characters in Sosuke's school life and how they impact his character, *inhale* but we got what we got. We'll come back to this later.\n\nNow with the SOL aspects out of the way, how does the plot stuff stack up? Pretty alright. Most of the \"arcs\" in the show have to do with the MC dealing with terrorists threats and keeping bitch queen Chidori safe almost episodically over the course of a few or more episodes each and they are pretty tense and high energy. They pretty much are the best parts of the show. In fact the third arc of the show is the one that gives us a good understanding of Sosukes identity and why he is the way he is better than the comedic shit does and puts him through certain struggles that make him develop as the show goes on. However the one flaw i see is that a couple of them are mostly rather pointless in terms of how they develop the characters creating somewhat of a pasing issue. But these are at least somewhat effective and largely inoffensive.\n\n*Gun X Sword OP*\n\nI am a simple man who loves his mech battles. While many of the fights in the show are mostly passable, i wouldnt lie to you if i say id rather see gundam F91 for its action than this(as much as i hate that movie). The animation is fine, but not detailed enough to give you the sense of battle most of the time and can be quite janky in certain places, making it seem like some corners were cut in the production value in the mech fights. Especially in times when the MC and villain uses the Lambda driver, showing mostly unmemorable particle effects. They dont really get better until the half way point, where startegy, use of environment and militaristic tactics are used. Not to mention generally better fight choreography. The designs of the characters and mechs arent bad though(my fave being the main mech Arbelest). \n\nNow we move to the characters and since i've already stated how the school side characters are practical pointless, uncharismatic and add nothing to our main duo, we'll move on to the guys that matter.\n\n*Big O OST- Sure promise plays*\n\nSosuke Sagara is a boy who spent most of his life as a mercenary and knows practically nothing of domestic life, which causes him to have sporadic instances where he mistakes something normal for a time where he needs to \"YOOOOOOO JOE!\". This is the fundamental driving force for all his SOL antics, which i remind you is the least good part in the show for the reasons i stated above. I understand that those moments are design to showcase this aspect of his character and maybe have him go through a mid life crisis deal where he questions his own purpose and existence in life and if he can even be his own person let alone a force for good(a la Guts from berserk) and to be further enveloped by the new life he has made and the non combat experiences to creating a sort inner struggle within him. However his plight gets played too much for comedic effect and escalated a tad too much for us to take it seriously and since those moments barely advance his character at all, those moments are rendered pointless. When the show takes him out of the role of a highschool student, he might not become the most complex protag, but he's a lot more competent seeing as how he is in his element. Of course the fact that you become so comfortable within that state kinda goes against the general purpose of taking him out his comfort zone. And like i said, things do get revealed about in the later part of the show, which gives us an opportunity to show us whats in this G.I.jokes head. But the way he develops overall is mostly subpar and sporadic. He still has some moments that are pretty endearing despite how much of a socially inept straight faced hick he is. Just wished that showed off more often.\nNow he does have a super special awesome mech (cause why wouldnt he) which has a hidden system that when activated can produce energy powered by Sosuke's will, and if your're wondering yes this does deus ex save his ass a couple times in the show. Of course Sosuke himself has a sort of love hate relationship with the machine that only works when it wants to. Kinda hard for someone as stiff as he is to rely on a machine that almost unscientifically powers you with your inner mojo, so he doesnt use it other than his important battles. He aint OP like Kira Yamato or nothing but it does make fights lack tension seeing as how all Sosuke needs to do is awaken his chakra G Gundam style and use shining finger. Overall Sosuke is an alright protag.\n\n*Undertale OST Dummy Gooseworx cover*\n\nKaname Chidori ladies and gentleman. She's the main female lead of the show. A popular above average high school chick. She's the target for the terorists who want the secrets of super technology and psychic prowess in her head; as well as the target of my discomfort. She's basically every bratty teenage tsundere you can find in anime. Now admittedly i will say that her attitude towards our local MC is somewhat justified seeing as he somewhat is responsible for all the dumb shit happening around her and generally flipping her whole life upside down despite his aims to protect her from harm. This would be fine if the jokes were funny and... well you know the drill. So it kinda makes her come off as irritable at times. I get its only natural for her to be this way in this case but there are times in the show where its too overplayed and she makes outright dumb decisions where it does not justify her being a petulant cunt. She does use her hidden mcguffin powers to help the heroes and she does get a chance to understand sosuke better later on, including one charming scene in the last episode. Other than that, general personality isnt all that endearing and neither is her interactions/relationship with Sosuke. So yeah, this chick who looks like the descendent of Marth from Fire emblem is unlikable. Dabu Dee dabu die, bitch.\n\n*Nadesico OP*\n\nOn to the characters who are a part of Mithral. Tessa is a pretty good supporting character. She's clumsy but still very charming. Despite her young age and demeanor she is a very effective captain of her group and made pretty sound decisions throughout the show(if you can ignore the probability of it). Other than that one pissing contest she had with another female character Mao in one episode, but it was mostly to have her understand the hardships and struggles her subordinates go through when they enter battle. She also has a crush on Sosuke (oooooh love triangle. Drama~) for actually understandable reasons. Given how somewhat of an awkward person she is and her environment and the fact that Sosuke is the only other person her age around, it would make sense for her to gravitate towards his military charm. She admires him for his strength and resilience which contrasts her own doubts about herself as well as the respect her crew gives her. And she doesnt come off as someone who exists soully for his sawed off shotgun, if you catch my drift. Plus she's a mcguffin like chidori so she's helpful in that area too. Which probably explains why she wouldnt have chidori put in a safe house somewhere under surveillance to keep her safe from the terrorists after her, cause she sympathizes with her plight to be a normal girl. Of course maybe sending Sosuke to protect her wasnt the best move. But overall she is a fun and effective character. \n\nOthers like Kurtz and Mao are fine. Mao is the no nonsense valkyrie bitch who has some okay dialogue and Kurtz is the charming pervert with very little actual charm. They both act as sort of besties to Sosuke in his soldier life and are very useful throughout the show. They've done little to damage their characters, but not too much sticks out. they do have some funny moments though despite not really changing throughout this season of the series. \n\n*New Getter Robo OST- Deep Red*\n\nThe main big bad is Garam and he is a pretty entertaining villain to a point. He is a constant threat throughout the show, rival and nemesis of Sosuke, and has some pretty endearing dialogue that lets him shine. He's kinda like Kenpachi Zaraki from Bleach but evil and in a mech. Also he acts as a parallel to Sosuke's identity, him being mad and battle hungry and Sosuke trying his best to appear as less of a savage like him despite his upbringing. Although the one thing i have an issue with him is that he always has a severe case of the not deads throughout the show and it only took the last ep for the heroes to finally \"kill\" him. The unstoppable killing machine angle can work but its too overdone here. Seeing the same guy die over and over mostly cause of the Lambda driver thing protecting him is kinda tiring to see. If he had only appeared in two arcs in the story preferable the first and last , he wouldve been much better handled and his final fall would have more impact. But he is entertaining and formidable villain throughout the show overall.\n\nSo overall Full metal Panic season 1 is an alright semi-real mecha show that is kinda bogged down by its main gimmick that being its SOL aspects and occasional fanservice. If the show managed to integrate both of these aspects seamlessly it wouldve improve a lot and there wouldnt be near constant tonal whiplash. But the action is okay, plot inoffensive/concise, and has a few likable characters. So I'd recommend it. But only as a passtime.\n\nIf you liked this review, ill be making one for Second Raid soon.

When I first got into this show I didn't like it at first, but I gave it a second chance and ended up liking it.\n\n\n\n\nStory 6/10\n\nOn the island mysterious of Hatsune,\nWhere the cherry blossom trees bloom all year along.\nThe smell of love starts to fill the air.\n\nIt starts with are main character Junnichi has a dream about girl that is going to meet him in the near future. After being woken up by his step sister named Nemu. He starts to make his way to school.\nHe then meets his cousin Sakura, for whom they thought was living in America, Sakura has come to finish the promise she made to Junnichi when they where children. The first half is pretty much an episodic story that contains slice of nothing really happens moments\nFor example, when the main character comes across that cat girl maid or when he just doing his day to day activities. We slowly see romance starting to take form, which I found somewhat boring to watch.\nHowever, it is necessary, because otherwise I wouldn't care about whats happening in the story.\n\nThe second half is more focused more on the love triangle that has manifested between Junnichi, Nemu and Sakura. Both of them are fighting for his affections, which has been building up over time and comes to the surface for all to see. Our main character, then has to make a choice, which is kind of bittersweet but was essential to furthering the plot. So I thought this was a very relaxing ]and it does deliver on those feels. Moreover, when the show gets serious, the show handles itself with maturity, which I quite like. Especially because love triangles can turn ugly very quickly.\n\nThe show wasn't without its blemishes and negatives. It really is kind of just a standard story that I have seen told many times before. Additionally, for some reason there is some magic elements in this story with the main character and his cousin (who can use magic) and a magic tree that grants wishes. Another problem I did have with magic being in this show is the fact that there isn't really much explained about how the magic system really works in this world, and any information we are given is pretty vague. It just seems like that the magic in this show can pretty much do anything you want, and yes I know this is a romantic comedy and I shouldn't take the magic elements seriously. Even though, it's a simplistic romantic comedy but the lack of information kind of bothered me.\nMoreover, I didn't like magic and I must give them credit that the magic it made things a lot worse. Therefore, magic impacted the decisions and choices that characters made within the overall story.\n\nCharacters 5/10\n\nThe main character is pretty much your run of the mill visual novel protagonist, who is kind, thoughtful, and always wants to help people with their problems. Even if he the one who will be the most affected by it. The side characters are also very one note. For example, you have a air headed rich girl and her younger sister who always cook hotpot on the school roof very school day. \nThere is pretty decent character development with the people in this love triangle. Besides, the above points nothing else warrants a mention. \n\nArt 6/10\n\nThe animation is average as a whole. The colours scheme is very vibrant and bright and goes with the lighthearted one of the show. It has this very cute style it. Also the transition to the the more darker and drama tone of the show with a dim and greyer color scheme. It's background animation is pretty average. I thought the character design where kind of basic.\n\nSound 5/10\n\nThe ost was pretty forgettable, but it did fit the tone of the show pretty well. Furthermore, the ost was composed by Yuko Kanno, who has worked on other anime osts such as JoJo Bizarre Adventure Stardust Crusaders and Ajin. I thought the voice acting was fine for the most part. The subtitled version was well done.\n\nEnjoyment 6/10 \n\nI found it very bland most of the times when I was watching it and the only parts I loved about it was the love triangle parts that moved the story along. I also found it quite relaxing to watch.\n\nOverall, 6/10 \n\nIn conclusion, if you like visual novel adaptations or shows that take their drama and romance somewhat seriously, then you will probably like this show."}, {"id": 2974, "score": 52, "body": "Warning this review may contain spoilers.\n\nfirst impression, so we have a future world with mutants and evil corporations. With a rescue, the girl plot going on seems interesting enough. And considering I checked this out in my rookie days. This was more enough to get my interest and see what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up. \n\n\nStory, 5/10\nSo are story with main character kyosuke who was living with his mom in some sort of cathedral and one day they get Attacked and before she dies she stabs kyosuke and days later he wakes up alive and meets a girl who claims to be his twin sister Runa this girl is then kidnapped by the Kirihara corporation who want to capture Runa for some possibly evil reason and After that he meets a middle-aged man named Shiro who helps him get his sister back.\nBut it turns out that this girl is actually something called a flicker who contains a piece of his sister Runa and he finds out he a mutant is known as soul taker.\nWhile they're trying to find the Flickers and save Runa are duo is joined a by a mutant named Komugi who decides to help them on their quest to catch them all while fighting the forces of the kithara group and the hospital mutants.\n\nSo Soul taker starts out as pretty much an episodic, save the girl and fight the monster of the week kind of series, which at first glance seem very boring and cookie cutter. And considering how there are Meany series similar to this you are probity wondering how does soul taker hold up or retain any interest in me or any viewer who would even bother to watch it. Well I would say to that is while the first half of the series is nothing really to write home about, but I would say that the Secord half of the series is where the real meat of this series lies. As it evolves from a monster of the week plot into a series about grand conspiracy revolving around a virus that turns people into mutant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, aliens and people trying to play god. Which sounds pretty good and to give credit where credit is due I felt that soul taker story was inuring enough and the fact it tries to be different to warrant your attention is something I can really dig. Now when this first came out people would have praised it for being slightly different and thinking outside the box, but now in modem day soul taker ideas and concepts are so dated and the series in itself hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t aged well, its aged as well as a bottle of milk and it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help the fact that mealy of the story elements of soul taker feel like they were poorly ducked taped together. From the mutants, evil corporations, aliens, and some sort of virus were very poorly presented and I have no problem with the ideas for the plot elements because it made it a bit more interesting. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just that way were done and presented in a very clich\u00c3\u00a9 way, which kind of bothered me because I have seen other shows that have used similar ideas and did them a lot better., like blue gender, guyver and even I hate to say this even guilty crown did this better \nthe whole virus doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem that important or impactful like no one is flecking out that there is a virus that can kill them or turn them into monsters. Almost No one really seems to care its like oh yeah there virus going around that could mostly kill us and there mutants running around nothing to see here, in guilty crown this virus was a big deal and treated like a big deal or this idea of this alien who made this virus for the sole purpose to editing human D.N.A so one day a mutant would be born that would able similar to the alien in D.N.A so he could mate with it. why pick humans to be part of your project to bring back your race from excitation when there clearly other races that could be better for your needs, in Guyver it was expanded that humans where bioweapons made by this alien race and were also used as the basis for highly mutable super soldiers. \nBut in soul taker it seem like this alien just came across humanity and decided since he was Lonny and horny he decided to fuck about with the human genetic code so he could get a bride, which oddly enough kyosuke and runa are such mutants as they have evolved to the point where there basic like the alien but in human form. And the reason why I bring this up is that these series try\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to pull an Adam and Eve story at the end, with kyosuke being Adam and Runa being eve. Because Runa wants humanity to burn and the only person she cares about is her brother so why the fuck does not destroy all of humanity because you believe they would be a treat to you, your brother and the inbred mutant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to use to inherit the earth. Even though 99.99% doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even know or care about your existence in the slightest and with space travel technology it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be hard for you to travel far away from humanity and start playing house with your twin brother and what bothers me even more is all these references to Christianity that goes nowhere and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really add anything besides woh we mentioning things from the bible and the question I would like to pose is what does talking about angels, demon and etc have to do with this type of setting. And I can see the counter-argument being that those references are part of the native and they add some character and identity to the series. And while I would agree that viewpoint, I would like to counter that there not really doing much with it as they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really explore or criticize any of the theology behind it and more a less has it there for the sake of being there. \n\nBut besides those problems and nick picks I think we should talk about some of the things this series story-wise dose quite well. One thing I will praise the story for is that each of the flicker rescue mission all feel different and all have some sort of variety, besides the monster of the week shit, one episode which I really liked and showcases this, is the episode where the main character comes across the flicker named Megumi. Who at first seems alight. But you soon find out that she hates Kyosuke and runa with a passion. Because of their existence is in her mind the reason why she won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a normal life and will always be hunted like some wild animal. And what makes this episode very impactful to me at least is that it showcases how these flickers didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a choice to be mere fragments of runa, let alone be involved in all this bullshit.\nI also feel that the pacing for soul taker is pretty good and everything flows very well, nothing feels to ruched or to slow and its cool to see a series that can hit that sweet spot pacing wise even though its 13 episodes long. \nAnd my last positive I would say is that the conflict as well greyness to it has most of the bad guys of the week are not evil per say but are more a less people that fell from grace and it that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s itself make the main charter journey and the lives he takes more impactful as some of these people only sin was fighting for the wrong person or making a few mistakes in life. Like for expanse the hospital mutants who origalty wanted to use this virus to help people and in the process lost much of their humanity. In fact the leader of this group is his own father and what makes that so impactful is the reason why Kyosuke is out there fighting the Kirihara and the hospital mutants, is because he trying to find and save one of the few family members he has, but in order to do that he must fight and even kill his own father to compete for that task. Which is a pretty fucked up situation in my humble opinion.\n\n\nCharacters, 5/10\n\nThe main character Kyosuke is a slightly bland I want to be the good guy and the hero type of character. \nWho for the most was ok it's just personally I dislike these types of characters.\nI thought his slightly going to the dark side moments are ok but it doesn't lead to much and even though he is going through so much physically and psychology.\nI feel that character wise he was wasted potential Because he could be a really cool antihero but no he just cry's or Feels bad after he kills the bad guy of the week that are evil and trying to kill him. \nand while this fits with his character and makes him feel more human instead of being this larger than life powerful super mutant that just kill people with zero fucks given. Which would have been cool to see it's just the crying that really rubs me the wrong way, because When I think about The main character kyosuke kind of reminds me of kira from Gundam Seed.\nDon't know if that a good thing or a bad thing but considering that kria is my lest favored Gundam protagonist I count it as a negative.\n\nThe side characters are a tad bit more lively but most of them are still very one note. There is not match character development or fleshing out.\nExcept for shiro, Komugi, and runa.\nBecause Shiro has an ok back which relates to the main character, Basically he fell in love with a flicker who was killed by the Kirihara group that's he was actually a part of, he also makes a decent mentor figure to are the main character. \nKokugi is just kind of the tag along that's slightly useful and has a thing for are the main character, She more for comic relief than anything else and she was slightly fun to watch.\nRuna is ok as a character, But she not very fleshed out well and her reasons for doing what's she doing is kind of petty.\nAlso she doesn't have enough build up as well So another character that was wasted potential as well as her reason for doing what she doing is I love my brother way too much and I hate humanity because my mother tried to murder me so because of that humanity can burn even though that action was taken way out of context as that attempted murder was to awaken her powers so she could protect herself from the humans who do want to harm her and her brother. \nAlso, most of the villains or bad guys of the week are most one-note and boring. \neven if some of them have reasons and motivations that make them slightly above being a one-dimensional evil bad guy of the week. Like for example there main character father Richard who isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a bad guy and I can see where he is coming from and why he doing what he did. But on the other hand you got Yui Kirihara one of the main antagonists who have a good motivation for doing what she does, but I feel it falls flat because how could a successful smart women like her get tricked so hard, like for context she is hiding the alien that made that virus and working with it because it would bring her dead husband to life if she gave him Runa which turns out to be a troll.\nAnd I just wondering how a smart person like her could let herself get manipulated to such a degree and you can say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because she was so desperate to get her husband back that she was willing to try anything. But my problem with it is why didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t she ask for proof that this alien could deliver on what he offered and For a person who has such a high position in the business world I would have thought she would have asked for proof first instead of taking its words at face value.\n\n\n\nArt, 5/10 \n\nThe animation is a bit choppy and dated, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look as bad when compared to some series from the 2000s. but there are series that look nicer and flow better like Digimon tamers, s.CRY.ed and InuYasha. \nIt backgrounds are slightly bland and just looks like someone is on a drug trip. \nThe art style is very trippy and full of symbolism and metaphors and dark colors.\nWhich is slightly cool and no shocker here as the Director of soul taker is Shinbou and if you want to see what happens when he has a limited budget and without Shaft to enable him to go all out.\nLike there are entire scenes with just random shit going on like a clock gears Turing or biblical symbolises just because and I can tell that Shinbou tried his best to shove in as much of his latest acid trip into this show as he could and if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a fan of Shinbou and like his style I think you should check out soul taker just to see some works from his earlier days before he partnered with shaft.\nIt's fight scenes are ok, Could have been better, It's just hard to keep track what's going on exactly and it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help when most of the fights end with his finishing move lighting breaker \nThe character design is bland, but the mutants look cool.\nThey kind of remind me of guyver or devil man, It has that old school anime style to it.\nAlso its color scheme is very dim, like Most of the time the series looks so bleak and dim. Which goes hand and hand with the beck future setting that the series takes place in.\n\nSound, 5/10 \nI like the op song with gives the 80s feel like the beginning is just like soul taker and The ending I wasn't really a fan of because I find it boring as fuck. \nThe ost for this is slightly forgetful. But it does fit the tone of the show very well.\nThe music and ost were done by Kow Otani, Who done hit for Gundam wing, outlaw star and ZoidsConsidering that I like this series I found the ost kind of disappointing. Sub and dub are fine,But if I am being honest I heard better and worse. So both sub and dub are passable.\n\n\nEnjoyment, 5/10 \n\nI like the mutant fights as they all have different powers and forms which I thought was cool. now it could have been this ok rule of cool show with the monster of the week, save the girl, save the world from an evil corporation. Its just this series try\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to set some sort of higher standard and while I like the series for trying, the end product wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t up to par and I more a less enjoy it as a nice one-timer expiace or a series I could chill out and watch with a few friends while drunk \n\nOverall 5/10\nNow if you want if something somewhat entertaining And something easy to watch then soul taker is the anime for you.\nSo I guess it's an ok time passer for rookies but I wouldn't hold my breath.\nbecause in all honesty if you have any experience with anime storytelling as a whole then probably stare clear Because everything this show has done another show has done better and even if you enjoy and like soul taker I feel that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to become forgettable after a point as it pretty predictable and you see most things coming from mile away. So I feel that if you like this series but want something better, I think you should check out guyver or the first half of blue gender as a place to start. Before you move on to more things. "}, {"id": 2975, "score": 58, "body": "Junk Boy is a 1987 ecchi OVA produced by Victor Entertainment. Having no Wikipedia nor TV Tropes page, I think it's safe to say I'll be reviewing another obscure anime today.\n\nAs an aside, while I don't want to get into the habit of spoiling anime in my reviews, as this is a forty-five minute OVA, its almost inevitable that I'll spoil most of the anime if I describe anything. On the bright side, knowing the plot doesn't detract from much in Junk Boy's case.\n\nIn the first minute or so of Junk Boy, we are treated to no less than four pairs of bare anime breasts. The OVA wastes no time in telling viewers _exactly_ what type of anime it is - a hardcore ecchi at best and a tame hentai with a plot at worst. If you have someone that may enter your room, it's best to sit this one out, folks.\n\nStep into the sneakers of Ryohei Yamazaki, a shameless hypersexual man who aspires to work at the gravure magazine, Potato Boy. If you're tired of the shy, dense, and borderline asexual protagonists of harem anime fame, Ryohei will be a breath of fresh air.\n\nOr at least he would be if he wasn't a grade-A creep and jerk, a trait that's stated in exasperation by other characters in the OVA. If you destroy the seriousness and charm of characters such as Master Roshi or Jiraiya and ramp up their skeevy pervertedness to eleven, you have Ryohei. It's hard to not roll your eyes in disgust as he embraces random women and rubs his giant gag penis against them while having a perverted fantasy.  In the first five minutes, we see the extent of Ryohei's character - he's horny to an utterly obnoxious extent. The beautiful editor of the magazine causes his hormones to go wild, and he botches his interview.\n\nHe is promptly hired.\n\nA big problem I have with this anime that it seems that for far too long, Ryohei's antics go unpunished; he's often __rewarded__ for his bad behavior. Towards the end of the movie, he starts getting rejected and slapped around, but by then the damage has been done. Junk Boy is completely ridiculous and not in the good way. \n\nThe OVA's too crude for my tastes, and it often ruins moments that could genuinely be good. As an example, there's a scene where Ryohei and the photographer go to take a gravure shoot of a singer. The singer seems disinterested and thus her shots aren't particularly appealing. Ryohei then decides to reveal how she was his idol and he masturbated to her when he was younger and encourages her to be better so she can be like the woman he once fantasized about. It would have been sweet...in a strange, off-color way. But then the anime ruins it by having him then lustily rub against her with his erect penis, followed by her being __pleased by its size__.\n\nWhile breasts and derrieres are all that's shown, it still seems a bit much for an ecchi and comes across as the writers needing to slap a plot on an animated pinup. While this would be fine for a hentai, it's not and the poor plot shows. \n\nAnother problem the anime has is that it seems to have an identity crisis. In addition to being ecchi, it's a comedy. The problem with this is that it more often than not isn't funny and I was pretty ashamed the few times I laughed (which were due to facial expressions more than anything, if nothing else the anime is well-animated). More ridiculous still is that it tries to become a romance in the second half. With Ryohei being nothing more than a creep that lusts for any feminine woman that moves throughout the first half, I wasn't buying it. The fact that after getting the girl (because of course he does), he decides to harass his boss again just drives the point home that the romance plot was shallow. It doesn't help that the first half moves briskly while the second half is a crawl (or as much of a crawl you can be with twenty animated minutes).\n\nJunk Boy _could_ have worked, honestly. Focus on Ryohei's antics and show off a few more scenes of him getting raunchy material for his job. You could dial back his personality to make him bearable and you'd have a pretty decent ecchi. If you actually do want to have him grow as a person, you'd need to have a few more episodes or an entire series. This was adapted from a manga, and I believe being one forty-five minute OVA could be the cause of many of my problems. \n\nOverall, while this isn't anything to write home about, it's not terrible. It has that sleek, 80s anime look, the dub is pretty good for a late 80s anime, the music is decent, it's funny at times, and the women look nice if that's your thing. If you're just looking for a goofy ecchi, you could probably do worse. If you're looking for anything else, you could definitely do a lot better.\n\n5.8/10\n"}, {"id": 2976, "score": 50, "body": "Warning: this review may contain spoilers.\n\nFirst impressions: So another anime based off of a hentai game again. I really need to stop watching these. Now I would like to add that I liked this anime and it's pretty hard to review an anime with this much controversy surrounding it, but I will try my best to review it.\n\nStory: 5/10\nThe story begins with our two main characters Haruka and his twin sister who have decided to move to a rural town where they once spent the summers as kids because both of their parents died in accident. And that's pretty much it- they meet old friends and what not. \n\nIt's pretty much like most rom-com anime. It's based around a high school in a small town and there are some girls that like the main protagonist. So probably judging from what I have said so far you will probably think this show is generic and it kind of is in a way. But I would like to add that Yosuga no Sora does add something I little different from what most rom-com normally do, whether this is a good or a bad thing I don't really know.\n\nThere are a few things that this show does a bit differently which I am going to mention now. One thing is the narrative of this show. Now most anime based of a hentai game will generally adapt one routes of the game with parts of other routes in between. This is what this show does a little differently. It follows a ground hog day narrative formula and goes through all the girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 routes.\nWhat I liked about this approach is that I was able to see all these routes play out and I got to see all the characters in a different way in every route because I also got a bit of drama with each route surrounding the girl who is the main girl in that route. Even though the drama was generic and the routes have pretty much the same plot beats.\n\nBasically, the main character meets a girl, she has problems, and then the problem is solved by the main character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dick. Now even though it does boil down to that, the only routes that I personally thought where interesting was the Nao route and the Sora route. These were the only routes that actually did something that was actually serious and took their selves seriously enough.\n\nAnother thing the show does a bit different, is the fact that it has a lot of off NSFW scenes that pretty much go into soft core porn territory. If you think I am joking I am not I am very serious. This show has sex scenes in it and if you have watched some hentai, then I am pretty sure you will know what to expect. Now at first I was a little shocked at first because I hadn't seen something like this in an anime before and I didn't really expect this at the time. But I didn't really mind this because at least they are kind of staying true to the source material.\n\nAlso, one thing that I would like to add is that the story can be very controversial in how it handles this kind of content. For example, in one of the routes the main character goes into a relationship with his twin sister. There is also a part where they show the main character getting raped as a kid. Which at that point, I am thinking to myself wtf. And I can see why people would find this very off putting. Now as for me personally, I didn't really care. But to be honest I was kind of on the fence about the whole rape and incest plot point. But it does handle itself with a bit of maturity. So I give that a pass.\n\nAnother down side to this style of narrative is that the routes were really rushed so if you want to see the same story but slower then you should probably play the game. And also the fact it went so fast that it really doesn't leave any actual impact. But even though they were rushed it wouldn't of helped the show that much anyway because of how generic the story telling was.\n\nCharacters: 5/10\nThe main character Haruka is pretty generic over all. One thing that is different about him is that he makes some very questionable choices which made him a little fun to watch.\n\nThe side characters are pretty much one note. But they do try to add a bit depth- I guess- to the characters but overall it doesn't really work because of how rushed and generic the story was. Also this is a harem story I am talking about. All the characters fit in to certain fetish types so , to be fair, the characters were going to be one note any way.\n\nArt: 6/10 \nThe animation was pretty average by the books, meaning there was nothing really bad or good about it as a whole. It uses a very bright color scheme that goes well with the summer time kind of weather and setting that the show takes place in. \n\nOverall, it has a very clear cut style to it. The character design are also generic and kind of sexualize a lot. But hey, why I am complaining?\n\nSound: 6/10\nThe OST fits with the tone of the show pretty well. The OST isn't the best but it did an okay job. The OST was composed by manabu miwa who has also done the OST for little busters and nyan koi.\n\nThe voice acting was ok, nothing too amazing, but they do a decent job. This show only has a sub, probably because of the nature of this show. But as far as a sub goes it not that bad \n\nEnjoyment: 5/10\nSo what I liked about the show is that it was trying to be a little different, which isn't bad. Another thing I like is that it follows the actual source material to a point. Plus I also enjoyed the fact that these relationships went all the way. And that's something we don't see much especially for a show that aired on public television.\n\nOverall: 5/10\nYosuga no Sora is pretty much one of those anime where if you like it you going to like and if you hate then you are going to want to destroy every trace of it from the world hoping it never sees the light of day never again."}, {"id": 2977, "score": 66, "body": "Waring this review has spoilers.\n\nFirst Impressions\nSo we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got parody of superheroes with a M.C. who takes out his enemy's with one punch and its apparently considered to be the savior of anime. What could possibly go wrong? \n\nSide note, this has been edited on 3/3/16\nStory, 6/10\nOne Punch Man is an okay parody on the super hero genre. it has this very bare bones \u00e2\u0080\u009cmonster of the week\u00e2\u0080\u009d kind of plot. \nOne punch man basic plot didn't really bother me that much because this is a parody show and when it comes to parody shows you really do not need the best story out there you just need something basic to keep the plot going. When it comes to a basic plot to keep the story going one punch man dose this very well.\nAlso while watching this show I had to ask myself did I find this entertaining. Yes I did find it entertaining because at the end of the day that is what a parody show is supposed to do \n\nNow one negative I have to say about One Punch Man and this is probably me nit picking but \nas a whole one punch man runs on a singular joke, which can make it loses its steam very fast . You might as well call it one pun.\nSpeaking of it running on one joke which did bother me a bit because you would think that a parody show would have more jokes than just one joke. But what should I have expected from a title like one punch man. \nCharacter's, 5/10 \n\nThe M.C. is overpowered to the max. he just an average guy who want to be hero for fun and fight strong opposition.\nThe side characters are quite lively and some what interesting. \nThey are pretty much parodys of super hero type would see in comic books. \nArt, 8/10 \n\nThe animation is fanatic to say the least with its lovely backgrounds and well animated fights. \nSound, 6/10\n\nIt has a great op that matches the show and a good ost that fits the shows tone.\nThe ost was made by makoto Miyazaki \n\n\nenjoyment, 7/10\n\nwhat I love about this show is the fact that it is doing a parody on super hero's.

While trying to hide this fact, he finds out that Aki also loves him through a very awkward bath time experience and a heart to heart chat which eventually leads to sex. At this point, both of them decide to began their relationship together.\n\nSo Aki-sora is basically an ecchi drama with a taboo relationship added in for more flavour. It's centred around the main character trying to come to terms with the fact that he and his sister are in love with each other and are in this incestual relationship while trying to hide it from everyone else.\n\nSo we have this romance story about incest which would turn a lot of people away. Which I can kind of understand a bit. But personally, I don't really mind because for me it not what is in a story that counts; rather, it's what they do with it that counts. For the most part, Aki-sora does do an okay job at presenting this taboo relationship.\nThey took it seriously enough that it has some very genuine moments within it, and it actually looks like they both care for each deeply. But I would like to add before I continue this review that I am in no way promoting the idea that any of you try and fuck your family members.\n\nBut like all those who pursue forbidden fruit, they eventually get the consequences of what such a \u00e2\u0080\u009crelationship\u00e2\u0080\u009d would offer. However, I would probably use that word loosely. But this taboo relationship becomes almost like flavouring at some points because the story decides to throw in a harem so that everyone can get on the main character's mighty sword. \n\nLiterally right after he starts going out with his sister, Sora gets dragged into all these crazy sexual situations, like meeting a girl who is an exhibitionist, getting into a sexual relationship with his twin sister's best friend, getting raped by his twin sister, getting involved in an orgy, and also having sex with one of his friends girlfriend twice. So It's really over the top with its fan service, which didn't bother me that much because  I quite like ecchi and fan service and all that other stuff. But the problem with it is that this story has quite a bit of quote-unquote \"mature\" content in it. \n\nBecause this show does have incest as a main theme, which is quite serious I might add, it's nice that this story took that aspect at least a little bit seriously. However, I couldn't take this story seriously because of all the other stuff that is going on in the background. I mean if you are in \u00e2\u0080\u009clove\u00e2\u0080\u009d with someone, you generally don't have casual sex with a bunch of other people while in a serious relationship. Or maybe that's just me because I was raised in an old-fashioned household. Maybe this is some new social practice which I haven't heard of before.\n\nHowever, one positive regarding this aspect, in particular, is that it seems to show you some of the different ideologies that people have when it comes to relationships with the main character by exploring some those different ideologies with some of the different characters in the story. So that was kind of interesting. Although they really don't too much with it.\n\nHowever, when I think about it, this is an ecchi story, so I shouldn't take it too seriously. But it's interesting for an ecchi show to have some kind of serious aspects to it. So I give credit where it's due.\n\nBut the final nail in the coffin is the ending. It basically ends open to interpretation. I feel there was going to be more story, but never got the chance to get there. Afterwards, I found out that it actually got cancelled. So I guess that explains it.\nBut I still feel that it was incomplete. But even if that were the case, a good writer would actually take that into consideration when trying to wrap it up. Not saying the writing was bad\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Ok, to be honest, the writing was pretty meh as a whole. \n\nCharacters, 5/10\nSo the Main character can be pretty much described as a person who has got a sister complex and is somewhat of a pushover. However, I did like the fact he was somewhat realistic in his reaction to him being in these somewhat sexual situations with a lot of these girls that we meet. Because let's be honest- wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t most men his age do a similar thing he was doing if they got Into those situations?\n\nThe side characters are pretty basic in personality and I wouldn't say generic; rather, it's just that they feel very unnatural to me as characters. Although, it is probably because they are involved in situations that isn't your every day kind of thing. But they do add some psychoanalysis to the characters in order to add some depth to them, which I quite liked. But other than that there really isn't much to them.\n\nBut I really liked the whole thing about Sora's twin sister Nami and her best friend because it basically shows you what jealousy can actually do to a person and how you shouldn't try to pursue a relationship when you have been in the friend zone.\n\nArt, 6/10\nSo the artwork for Aka-sora Is pretty average. The nsfw scenes were nicely drawn. The backgrounds were okay for the most part. The character designs are also generic.\n\nEnjoyment, 5/10\nSo for Aki-sora I kind of liked it for what it was. But at the same time, I don't know whether to hate it or the like it, so I liked that it was somewhat different I guess. And that's not a bad thing. But in all honesty, if you going to do something like this, I think it better if you try a bit harder to make your story better written.\n\nOverall,6/10\nIf you are a person who has strong morals then I recommend that you stay away from this and read something different. But if you are a person that likes ecchi then you will probably like it a bit, I guess. But in all honesty, this would have been better as a hentai instead of an ecchi/drama/whatever tags it has."}, {"id": 2980, "score": 50, "body": "this warning review may contain spoilers.\n\nFirst impressions, so another anime based off a hentai game.

Really show your really going to do this why?\nBecause you had something good going here and you decide to throw it off a cliff.\nIt doesn't completely bother me that much because at the end of the day the story could only go so far being what it is.\nBut they could have done something a little different.\nWhich would have been nice.\n\nCharacters, 5/10 \n\nThe main character is pretty much a generic protagonist with the only thing interesting about him was being this geno killer thing.\n\nThe other characters were pretty one note nothing really special about them.\nThere basic cardboard cutouts pretty much.\n\nArt, 5/10\n\nThe animtion for the most part was all right nothing good nor bad about it. \n\nThe art style is a bit bright and colorful for my taste.\n\nthe character designs also looked alright.\nIt's just usual shit.\n\nSound, 6/10 \nIt had an ok op. The ost was pretty average by rom-con standards.\n\nBecause nothing really took my interest.\n\nEnjoyment, 5/10 \n\nWhen it comes to enjoyment about this show I really don't have much to say. It was pretty generic.\nBut one thing I did enjoy about it is that it had some promise and it had some good parts about it.\n\nOverall, 5/10\nSo overall akaneiro ni somaru saka is pretty much a standard fare when it comes to rom-com thing. It did try to be better but instead of trying something new. It went the cliche way. So this show is pretty forgeable.\nBut it's an ok time passer I guess if you like Rom-com I guess.\n\nBut if you not a big fan of that shit probably go somewhere else.\n\n\n"}, {"id": 2983, "score": 66, "body": "Warning this review may contain spoilers.\n\n\nFirst impressions, so my first thoughts on this manga were holy shit I didn't think you could take the concept of roller skating and make it this crazy and over the top.\n\nStory, 6/10\n\nSo welcome to the world of air gear where people fight each over in contests of extreme skill and power with roller skates or a-t as they are called.\n\nThese people are called storm riders.\nand ikki a young baby faced thug dreams of being a storm rider especially after he got his ass handed to him by the local gang of storm riders.\nalso there a mysterious girl he meets who he slightly interested in who also a storm rider. So one night he finds a pier of a-t aka \"roller skates\" and desides to take them out on a spin which leads him to getting into a few fights and him deciding to start his own gang and fight his way to the top.\n\n\nThe first half of the story is pretty much him getting the key members of his gang.\nAnd getting into badass fights and leaning the ways of storm riders.\nWhich I thought was pretty interesting.\nBecause the storm rider world has so meany elements and layers to it.\nLike the codes of honor and rules of combat that a allmost every storm rider follows,\nTo an extent The history behind it and The multiple paths you can take as a storm rider.\nLike for example you can fight In the official pro leagues or if being a corporate shill isn't your thing you could be a top tier street fighter of the A-T world There a lot of choices for what you can do as a storm rider.\nI think that kind of freedom and diversity make the setting feel very organic even if some of the things that happen don't make much sense.\nBut back to the story.\nIkki and his group continue to fight more powerful people and even met a few of the strongest storm riders out there This leads to him basically getting an entire army on his side.\nWhich is a group named Genesis Which is basically a organization made from smaller groups with the same goal in mind.\nWhich is to defeat the group known as Sleeping Forest Who protect an item of great power known as the Sky Regalia.\nWhich has the power to give humanity wings apparently The story kinda vague about it what exactly it dose.\n\nBut before i continue,\nI just want to explain what a regalia is.\nIt's basically an object that give it's users almost super natural powers and the only people who can ever hope to contain such power are known as kings People who are the top of the a-t world. \nSo the reason why I mention the regalia.\nis because they think that ikki might be the storm king at will lead humanity into a new era or something along those lines.\nIt's kind of vague what it exactly means but just roll with it.\n\nThe second part of the story is pretty much where shit hits the fan hard and there more focus of plot.\nAnd I mean shit hits the fan.\nThere the actual characters that die who name I am not going to mention.\nBut what basically happens is that ikki is dragged into a conflict between Genesis and sleeping forest.\nHe is given the choice of what side he going to join.\nBeing the bad ass he is, \nIkki turns around and say fuck both you guys I going to kick both your asses and become the storm King myself.\nNot because of giving humanity wings or anything like that but more of because Ikki just wants to become the storm King.\nWhich basically puts him against most of the A-T world at large.\n\nThis part is pretty much even more crazy fights which get more intense and crazy as it goes along and more characters drama and relationship shit.\nIn fact the fights get so crazy that At the end you have ikki and the main villain fighting In a tower that reaches beyond the atmosphere With debree flying everywhere as it collapses mid fight.\nI am not going to say how it ends or who wins or any other details because I want you people to read it for yourself \nBut I am going to say it's just amazing to read and see it play out.\n\n\n\nSo now it a good time talk about the positives \n\nOne thing I liked about air gear is that it took something like roller skating and made it so crazy and over the top that you couldn't take it seriously. \nBecause You got people who are Doings things that Would deftly physics, you got groups of storm riders having gang wars with one another in mid air,\nyou got these magic roller skates I think that give you crazy powers like shooting out fire and lightning,freezeing time,air slashes that can cut though cars and stuff.\n\nTo sum it up in A more simple way air gear is roller skating on crack.\n\nThere is also some fan service and some romance elements to it with the main character and his child hood friend and some girls and boys who like the main character. \nWhich I didn't mind because it made the characters a bit more interesting and there was good drama around it.\n\nAnother thing I liked about air gear is that that have to use tatics and team work to win the battles which was nice.\nI don't mind no holds bar bet them up but it was quite nice to see some tatics being put in and Because it's also saying that there more fighting than using raw power.\nBecause raw power is nice don't get me wrong But the in world of a-t your not going to get every far unless you think outside the box a bit.\n\nThe last positive I want to add quickly is that this manga is very engaging and your never really bored Especially if you like over the top storytelling.\n\nThe few negatives \nI would have to say about air gear and it's not much of a problem for me personally but I think I should address it. \nIs that it really doesn't have much making sense about. The story for air gear pretty much sied to it's self is fuck all the logic I am doing this myself.\n\nAnother problem is how chaotic the flow of the story was at times.\n\nThere are parts where I don't know what the fuck is going on,\nBecause this story line has so many things at once and there rush of information at Times.\nEspecially in the second half.\nIf you got low attention span then maybe it's a plus for you.\n\nBut for me honestly who likes to take his time while reading.\nMy mind has to go light years a minute.\nIn fact a few times I actually spent 10-15 min looking at a planel or a page just to understand what the fuck is going on.\n\nI would recommend that maybe you read it a few chapters a week or something if you find the story a little confusing at times.\n\nBut overall the story was one kick ass ride.\nEven though at times it was hard to follow.\n\nCharacter, 6/10\n\nThe Main character ikki was pretty cool. He was a kind of cocky, street smart delinquent I guess.\nIt kinda develop into a better leader and is less of a dick at times.\nWhich was cool I also like his take no shit and do it my way kind of personality.\nI can relate to that a bit.\nI also like that he actually has flaws.\nLike him being reckless and head strong Which leads him into very bad situations.\n\nLike him picking fights with people are way stronger than him and could damage him so badly that he wouldn't be able to use A-T ever again.\nWhich almost happens a few times.\n\nThe side character are a little interesting \nMost of them are pretty two dimensional. But they all have a reason for being there and some of them are very interesting, \nfor example you got this one character who has split personality's\nDisorder.\nWhich was cool \n\nThere is some good character development and fleshing out.\nThere was also parts where they add depth to the characters as well. \n\nA good example of this is ikki right hand man and best friend Kazuma,\nWho was probably one of the weakest members in ikki group.\nWho at first gets overshadowed by characters like Akito and Issa.\nWho are clearly light years above him in both skill and power And it takes a while for him to find is place in the team.\nthe struggle with him trying to become Better was interesting and relatable.\nIntill his hard works pays off when he become a powerful a-t user in his own right. \nAnd quite a few other characters slight variations of that was well,The struggle to find your place or trying to improve yourself .\n\nSo I like the fact it took the time to do all these things.\n\nIn fact some of those characters feel like real people at time,\nLike some of the reasons for doing what there doing feels real and relatable.\n\nThey also had these cute little romances as well which as quite nice to watch them \nplay out.\nThe only problem I had with these characters is that there so meany of them which kinda adds it the chaotic part of the narrative.\n\nBut also they get as much attention as they should like some of the over characters.\n\nBut the character interactions kind of make up for it.\nSo It's kind of a give or take situation with the characters.\nBut over all I think there decent.\n\nArt, 7/10\n\nThe art work is pretty decent.\nThere also a lot of small details put into the back grounds and things.\n\nThe art style itself is very flashy and just oozes coolness.\nBecause everything looks very detailed with this street thug look to it.\n\nThe character designs are pretty interesting and fit the manga very well.\nThere warring different types of outfit and cool looking h\nAlso the fan services characters that look great to.\n\nThere is some very well done action scenes and they also catch the over the top nature of these fights.\nEspecially when they use this metaphor avatar things to show what's going on in a more bad ass way.\n\n\nEnjoyment, 7/10\n\nOne of the things I liked air gear is that it was a story that I didn't have to take seriously with it over the top nature. I also loved the fights. \nI also liked the characters as well everyone was interesting in some way or another.\n\nPlus I was never for a second bored with this manga.\nIt's was for me a blast from beginning to end.\n\n\n\nOverall, 6/10\n\nSo if you are looking for manga that is crazy and over the top or has got fan service then you will like this manga. \nBut if your the kind of person who is looking for any kind of logic to it then you are probably not like this is much as most would.\n\n"}, {"id": 2985, "score": 63, "body": "Warning this review may contain spoilers. \n\nFirst impressions, so after I had finished watching please teacher. I had found out that it had a sequel/spinoff called please twins. So at the time is was some what intrigued to check it out to see if it was as good as please teacher or at least watchable by rom-com standards and for the most part it was.\n\nStory, 5/10\nso like it pequel please teacher please twins main focus is another taboo relationship because last time we had the teacher now so let's now go with twins.\nSo the set up for please twins \nstarts out like most school life rom-com you know school life and what not.\n\nThe story is about Main protagonist named maiku or mike in the dub\nwho is an orphan and the only hint of his actual family is a photo of him as child with another person. Because of the events of please teacher he finds his childhood home which was also the picture he has. \nAfter he has moved in and set himself up one day someone shows up on his door claiming that they are his long lost twin sister who named miina then about 5min later another girl named karen shows up claiming the same thing. \nWith both of them having the same picture that mike has and also having the Same blue eyes as him.\nSo pretty much twins is about this big problem of one of then being a long lost relative and one of them being a stranger and none of them knowing who is the relative and who the stranger among the two girls. So after that mike decides that they should both live with him intill that can solve this problem.\n\nSo please twins if you didn't know is pretty much a romcom story with probably the most awkward plot set up I have seen in quite a while Because what are the odds of long lost relatives coming to you door around about the same time.\nThat's a little to bullshity to me but anyway.\n\nSo the story is pretty much about the daily life of mike, miina and Karen and the situations that come of with them living together.\nAnd of corse they fall in love with him,\neven though I don't think it's a good idea to persure a Romantic relationship with someone that could be your twin brother but it's not like that stopped anyone else in anime.\nSo for the most part plays out like usual romcoms.\nThere misunderstandings, there people that like the main character and miina and Karen try to stop it and last but not lest is the drama thing of who the relative and who the stranger.\nEven though at that point in the story it's didn't really matter because after what they been though together I doubt mike going to kick one of them out just because one of them isn't his sister.\nPlus why would get rid of them these girls they do his housework for him and help pay his bills.\nIt's more beneficial to have these girls around and it doesn't really change much after they find out who is who all it really says is this girl has dibs to try and have a relationship with mike. \n\nSo I would say my positives are.\n\nThat it still takes itself seriously enough even though it arguable.\nit's more kinkier than its predecessor but it's still more mature than most slice of life romcom school life shit.\n\nAnother positive is even though it's got fansevice it's pretty tame and try's to treat its characters with respect.\n\nI would my negatives are that.\n\nThis could have been a moody and darker show about trying to repressive the urge to persure a relationship despite the problems such a relationship would bring and there are scenes in the show which hint that the characters involved are having those kind of feelings. So it's no koi kaze it that aspect.\n\nAnother problem is that it's very dated and all its ideas have been done better before or even the concept itself has been improved in other stories .\n\nThe last problem or negative I have is that.\nThe whole who the relative and who the stranger conflict.\nWas solved in a very anti climaxic way and how that situation played out was a bit to mallow dramatic for my taste.\n\nCharacters, 6/10\n\nThe main character was a lot more interesting and had more of an defined personality compared to the previous main character.\nHis personality is pretty much the loner asshole who has a gentle side to him,\nWhen he not getting into fights. \nHe has a bit of teenage angst to him and the way he was reacting to his new situation was pretty understandable and reltale.\nBecause he is an orphan and for the first time in his life he has got an actual family and people out there that he himself cares about and they care for him.\nBecause let's be completely honest orphanages do suck.\nBut sadly unlike the previous main character he didn't get to go all to home base.\n\nSide characters.\nWe also get quite a few of the side characters from please teacher making an appearance which I quited liked and we get some new characters as well. \nBut you know they are still two dimensional at the most part as well.\n\nthe characters are relatable but the problem is there nothing really to deep about them. \nPlus the new cast doesn't have the Cham that the old cast had.\nWhich is funny to me because none of the characters really stood out to me.\n\nArt, 6/10\n\nThe animation is fine just like please teacher.\nBackgrounds is also fine but its needs work.\nBecause a lot of the time the backgrounds are very unfocused and sometimes really blurry and take me out of the immersion.\nIt also has some very bright colors that go well with the tone of the show.\n\nThe art style is a very dated it differently looks different form the norm we get now a days. Buts it still pretty generic art style.\n\nThe character designs are fine.\nWhat I think it slightly good about the character designs.\nIs that it's pretty tame especially for characters.\nthat for all intents and purposes are used for fansevice.\n\n\n\nSound, 5/10\n\nI slightly like the opening I don't care that much about the ending song in the slightest.\nThe ost was pretty forgettable over all for me.\n\nIt has some ok voice acting both sub and dub.\nBut other than that it's pretty much average.\n\nEnjoyment, 6/10\n\nSo over all I quite enjoyed please twins it not as good as please teacher.\nBut it was still fun to watch and I also quite liked how the whole thing play out any way.\nI also like some of the miss understanding parts that came up.\nLike for example there one episode where miina and Karen think mike is a homosexual. because there this guy who most likely bi sexual who hits on him and is the only person that mike really is seen with and the fact that mike isn't that really fussed when it comes to the ladies.\nSo pretty much Though that entire episode they basically try that click bait him to try and quote on quote fix him.\nEven though this episode they kind made homosexuality a joke which I didn't really appreciate but the episode was still funny to say the least.\n\nBecause we find out that wasn't the case and in fact we was actually trying his best to hold back.\nWhich I am going to quote in his words exactly what was keeping him back.\n\"One of them a relative One of them a relative One of them a relative \"\n\nOverall, 6/10\n\nIf you liked please teacher or rom-cons in general then you will probably like this.\nBut if you have seen enough rom-con shows then this will pretty much nothing much for you.\nBecause it's very dated and only nostalgia fans would really get value out of it.\n\n\n"}, {"id": 2986, "score": 61, "body": "Warning this review may contain spoilers. \n\nFirst impressions, so devil may cry a anime adaptation of a video game about this guy who fights demons sounds cool enough.\n\nStory, 5/10\n\nSo the story of devil may cry is about dante who is a demon hunter and is also a demon-human hybrid.\n\nSo if your a devil may cry fan you have probably wanted to know the question of what does dante do when he isn't saving the world or fucking some random chicks in a dumpster somewhere.\n\nWell if your asked yourself this question then you will me happy to know that this anime gives you idea. He fights Random demons he then eats pizza and sundaes and we are reminded that he is drowning in debt and doing all these things while being a badass.\n\nSo from what you have just read so far you can pretty much guess that there really isn't really a plot to this and for the most part you would be right.\nDevil may cry story is for the most part very episodic it mostly includes stand alone missions.\nthat dante dose for a living and some of what dante dose when he doesn't have work going on. Which is mostly him fucking around while eating high amounts of sundaes and pizzas.\nWhich I am not an expert of demon or half demon biology but surely eating all that pizza and sundaes would probably slightly bad for him .\nunless in this world just demons really love pizza and sundaes.\n\nBut other than that there really isn't much I can comment on\nthis show doesn't really use all the ingredients that it could used and even if this show for all intents and purposes is a kick ass rule of cool show about some badass dude fighting demons. It doesn't use or play on many of the elements it's brings up.\n\nLike one example there was an episode where we find a demon falling in love with this human women and though this episode we find out that not all demons are evil monsters that destroy and kill everything in there path and demons themselves have the ability to grow not just in power and also there personality and beliefs.\nAnd what really bothers me is that they gloss over this idea in one episode,\nWhich leaves me with few questions like why is this demon so different from the rest of his kind or what lead him to becoming like this.\nThey never explain or expand on that idea and concept.\nWhich I think is a wasted opportunity.\n\nNow I will mention that this show tried to have an overarching plot with the loli side kick that Dante has with him.\nThat dose lead to this plot In the end but it really doesn't matter in the long run of things. What happens is that the this demon that's trying to become some sort of super demon and needs the loli side kicks blood or something she has to complete it.\n\nBut it was boring and predictable and I don't care about in the lest.\n\nLike here is how they could have made this show ten times more interesting and not feel like a soulless video game ad in anime form.\n\nStill keep the episodic missions expect the episode count is 24 episodes and during these episodes we lean more about the lore and world of devil may cry.\nBecause the demon and super natural elements are quite interesting and it would cool to explore Dante childhood as being a half demon/orphan or talk about what other super natural shit that going down that doesn't involve demons.\nIt would be pretty cool to see Dante fight angels or some organization trying to capture or kill him because of his demonic nature.\n\nSurely that would be batter Than what we actually got and if it had those what ifs the story and anime could stand up on its own and not just be a video game adaptation.\n\n\nCharacter,6/10\n\nThe main character is pretty badass. I mean if you look up badass in the dictionary you would probably find this dude picture on it.\nHe is pretty cocky and very relaxed , says bad ass lines and dose the most badass things you can think of.\n\nThe side characters were also pretty cool as well.\nExcept one character because for some reason this show has a loli side kick for dante \nWho pissed me off some times.\n\nThe bad guys who are demons of the week.\nAre pretty much your throw away characters that I don't give a fuck about.\n\nArt, 6/10\n\nThe animation is pretty decent, it's very polished and shiny it is something you should watch in he if you can.\n\nIt also has this kind of dim color scheme that goes well with the kind setting that this show has.\n\nIt also has some pretty good fight animation as well.\n\nThe demon designs were pretty cool as well.\nDante also looks pretty cool as well.\n\nSound, 5/10\n\nNot a big fan of the opening or ending song.\nBecause it just a background noise music which doesn't sound good to me.\nThe ost is pretty decent and it fits the tone of the show pretty well.\nAnd I couldn't find out who did the ost.\nBut ost is ok.\n\nThe sub and dub is alight.\n\nPlus Dante English voice actor sounds like he does in the games.\n\nEnjoyment,6/10\n\nI liked the fight scenes.\nI also like the characters as well.\nI also like some of the designs for the demons they were pretty cool.\n\n\nOverall,6/10\n\nSo if you are Looking for a decent rule of cool show then you will probably like this anime but it seems like to be that you would have to be fan of devil may cry in order to like it more.\nIf you not a fan of the game you will mostly right this off as another sub par video game adaption."}, {"id": 2987, "score": 66, "body": "Warning, this review may contains spoilers.\n\nFirst impressions:\nSo, this manga is based off the hentai game and that adapts one the original routes in its entirety. It seems interesting enough, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got vampires killing people and some romance developing in the background. I wonder how they will handle this.\n\nStory: 6/10\nOur tale begins with our main character Shiki Tohno who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moved back into his family home after years of being taken care of by distant relatives, which he went to live with after a major incident that nearly killed him and gave him the ability to see lines of death. While getting used to being back with his sister and their twins maids, a mysterious case of vampire like murders is spreading out through the city like wildfire. One day while returning from school he comes across a mysterious foreign woman and like a good japanese citizen he cuts her up into multiple pieces, in what can be described as a psychotic rage. After a few days pass the same woman who he murdered visits him and reveals herself to be a vampire named Arcueid, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s come to the city in order to kill a powerful vampire known as Roa, who is behind the recent murder cases and other supernatural shit that's going down in the city. It turns out though that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been badly weakened by Shiki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempted murder, so she decides to strong arm him into helping her complete her mission and so begins their partnership together.\n\nTsukihime is probably one of the more interesting stories that have been done by type-moon, which doesn't revolve around \"people die when they are killed\" or \"the archer class is full of archers\". Jokes aside though, the story is pretty much Shiki and Arcueid going around together and killing lesser vampires while looking for Roa, which does get boring and repetitive after a while. Like how many times can you fight the same generic vampires before it gets stale? On the bright side, they do kind of flavor it with external and internal problems. For example, one external problem they face is when they go against Roa and this one vampire that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s made out of wolfs and shit. On the other hand, the internal problems they face are more about the main two characters and their dark sides coming out. One being that Shiki at times devolves into a bloodthirsty killer and Arcueid\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6... well, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a vampire, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self-explanatory what's going to happen.\n\nThere isn't really much to comment on, besides what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already been mentioned, except for the bond they have together, which turns into a romance, which as far as romances go it isn't that bad, all things considered. Because I have seen quite a few romance stories that use a couple who are a completely different species altogether and use this as an excuse for cheap melodrama and over the top emotional expressions, that make me want to vomit. Luckily though, the story doesn't do this and instead their relationship and how it was developed felt very normal. Because it was very simple and to the point, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bogged down by being overly emotional or being so pitch perfect that it felt robotic. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basically just them hanging out when they're not killing vampires and their relationship developing from that, so the romance is at least pretty decent.\n\nAll in all, the story was pretty ok and even shockingly grounded for a supernatural series. The last thing I can really comment on is probably the negatives. For starters, this story feels very dated and doesn't have enough punch to it. It has a very dated presentation and I feel that when this story originally came out it was pretty interesting and fresh in people's minds, but stuff like fate/stay night have kind of made it obsolete. Maybe if this series got a readaptation then maybe it would be better, because some of the ideas the series came up were interesting. One example of which is the way it explores the concept of vampires in this world. I also find it interesting how the series plays on the many legends surrounding vampires and explains them in a very straight forward matter, like why vampires need to drink blood and the like. The original source material for this was written in a basement by a group of people who were starting a game company, so i\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give the writing a bit of slack for that. At the end of the day tsukihime isn't badly written, especially when you consider the fact it's a manga adaptation of hentai game, so for that i give it a slightly good score.\n\nCharacters: 6/10\nThe main character Shiki at first seems like another bland protagonist, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a quote unquote normal highschool boy, but as the story continues we find at that that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the case. Even though he has this generic upbeat, pacifist, loner attitude, he has quite a few interesting traits that aren't really found in a quote unquote normal highschoolers. For example, he doesn't fear death and all too often makes very light jokes or comments about death and shit like that. He also has this kind of evil side to him, where he becomes this near unstoppable sociopathic killing machine when he is the presence of supernatural beings. Unfortunately, he can't control this bloodlust and it leads him to at times go slightly insane, where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interesting to see him try and hold on to what humanity he has left when that side of him tries to take over.\n\nArcueid is also interesting to a point. She has a very cat like personally, being very free spirited and not really getting bothered by much. The most interesting thing about her though is that she was originally a weapon made to seek out and destroy anything her creators told her to, but because of interactions with Shiki and the bond they formed together she basically broke out of her eternal cycle of wake up, hunt down and kill vampire, sleep, then rinse and repeat. Now because that cycle has been broken, she actually has time to enjoy the things in life that she never got a chance to enjoy, like going to the movies or just chilling in general, which is a concept which she really hasn't had the time to explore or learn more about.\n\nI found the interactions between Shiki and Arcueid really interesting, especially when they talk about concepts like for example, would you eat something that is equally intelligent as you or when Shiki takes Arcueid to places she hasn't been before, where she learns to have an attachment to the world around her.\n\nThe side characters are pretty basic for the most part. The thing that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty cool about the characters in general though is that we often get to know what they are feeling and thinking. Sadly, because the original source has so many routes that explore the characters in many different ways, so we don't get to see the full potential of each of the characters, as this manga only covers one route, in which it's mostly Arcueid that's gets focused on. What I will say about the other characters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 routes is that the focus on them is interesting to a point and there is definitely more there than you would have first thought. An example of this is when we find out that Shiki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s adopted family actually have a demonic bloodline and are half demons, that drink blood and go into a frenzy every now and then.\n\nThe main bad guy, Roa feels very flat and comes off as some sort of psycho yandere. The reason for why he was like this was also kinda stupid. Basically, what happened is that he fell in love with Arcueid and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand the emotions he was feeling at the time. Eventually he came to think those emotions where hatred and because of that started this century\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long personal war, which caused many deaths and even turned a few unlucky souls into vampires. So because of his reasoning he just comes off as really flat and not that interesting, even if the idea itself of a person experiencing emotions and not understanding them is kinda interesting. They just didn't really do much with that idea and kind of left it vague and up to interpretation.\n\nArt: 6/10\nThe artwork is not the best they could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done, as is it looks pretty choppy at times. Now one positive thing I can say about the artwork is that it kind of fits into the kind of setting that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presented. It also has somewhat ok fight scenes as well, that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really flow and basically boil down to how many body parts can our main characters remove in one strike. I like the characters designs, because I am a big fan of most things type-moon.\n\nEnjoyment: 6/10\nSo what I liked about this manga in particular is the romance, that was quite well done. The vampire fighting scenes were pretty cool was well. I also like how the main character is slowly losing his sanity, as he uses his powers more. I think the concept of being able to see death is interesting for an ability that people can have.\n\nOverall: 6/10\n\nConclusion:\nIf you're a fan of type-moon or you want a human vampire romance that isn't like vampire knight or twilight then you will like this manga, but if you're not into romance or stories with plots that have been used before then I guess you won't like this.\n\nSpecial credit to my new script editor, Lonecrit."}, {"id": 2989, "score": 50, "body": "Warning: this review contains spoilers.\n\nSummary:\nThe story of oniichan control revolves around Hirose Goushi, who over the years has developed a massive sister complex for his little sister, Noa. This leads him to do the responsible thing, and move out his hometown to Tokyo, so he can avoid the temptation and not hurt his sister, or himself. A couple of years pass, with him still not having gotten over his sister complex, then one day, Noa comes to live with him. It turns out they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be going to the college together. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s then revealed that Noa has an even bigger brother complex, and is somewhat of a yandere, who bugs his phone and sets up spy cameras all over his apartment. Basically, what the plot comes down to is Goushi trying to not fuck Noa, while she tries to set him up for failure.\n\nFirst impressions: So, another rom-com, fan service story. I wonder how this\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll turn out.\n\nStory: 5/10\nMost of the chapters pretty much involve the same \u00e2\u0080\u009cslice of nothing happens\u00e2\u0080\u009d and ecchi hijinx. When you get down to it, there isn't much I can comment on. When it comes to this series, it's just batshit insane. I guess the ride was fun and it was kinda interesting to see where it went. In all honesty though, the entire story was just a meme.\n\nCharacters: 5/10\nThe main character for once wasn't a high school student, so college student for the win I guess. Other than that, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty much bland as toast. The side characters were also pretty one-dimensional, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a little different than what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d normally get with this type of setup. For example, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got the creepy otaku, the mangaka and the yandere little sister.\n\nArt: 5/10\nThe artwork in general is all right, especially for the backgrounds, but the art style was very generic. One thing I did like about the artwork, was when the little sister went into yandere mode and it gave off this somewhat creepy vibe. I also kinda liked the character designs, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably cause they reminded me of chibi vampire, which was done by the same mangaka.\n\nEnjoyment: 6/10\nNow, if you think that I enjoyed reading this manga because of story and characters, then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be wrong. The reason I was enjoying it was mostly because of the fanservice. I also enjoyed the fact that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty easy to find what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong with it and just how easy it was to read.\n\nOverall: 5/10\n\nConclusion: Oniichan control is overall one of those stories where if you like it, you like it and if you hate it, then you want to set it on fire and watch it burn. If you like really crazy and over the top shit, then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll probably like it.\n\nSpecial credit to my unpaid and slightly pissed script editor, Lonecrit"}, {"id": 2992, "score": 50, "body": "Warning this review may contain spoilers.\n\nFirst inpressions, so We got another rom-com with a twist. The twist being that the main girl is some what crazy so what could go wrong.\n\n\nStory,5/10\n\nSo koharu no is hibi is about what most rom-com story's are about.\nYou know boy meets girl, boy and girl become friends and then boy and girl fall in love.\nThe usual thing you would find in these kind of story's.\n\nBut koharu no hibi doses some thing a little different from the norm. \nIt has a romance between a somewhat normal protagonist and this girl is some what obsessive with the main character. like this is pretty much some yandare level shit right here.\nThe story is pretty much about the over the top things that she dose to show her love for him and him pretty much reacting and trying to be a boyfriend to her. \nFor example of the over the top thing she doses.\nLike writing down his patterns, knitting him a jumper for 3 days straight for his birthday, having her room fall of pics of the main character, and kissing the main character childhood friend to get the main character first kiss back. Yah that is what actually happens I get the logic behind that ether. \n\nSo my thoughts on the story was well it's different and it kind of sweet and the problems I have with it in particular is that even though it's a little different it still follows the same plot mancanics like all the rom-com school life story's.\n\nSo over all my problem with is that it is quite generic.\nEspecially if you have seen enough rom-com.\n\n\n\n\nCharacters, 5/10\n\nThe main character is pretty much your generic school life protagonist.\n\nThe other main character is some what different form the norm because you really don't really see much of the yandare,ish type of character in these kind of story's. But other than that she pretty generic.\n\n\nThe side characters are pretty one dimensional carbord cut outs.\nAlso the side characters have a very big lack presence they are just there.\n\nThey really feel they are part of the back ground.\n\n\n\nArt, 6/10\n\nThe artwork as pretty ok for the most part. Like it nothing really special.\n\nThe backgrounds are ok as well.\n\nThe characters designs are generic as well so nothing really noteworthy here.\n\n\n\nEnjoyment, 6/10\n\nNow being a person who has seen a few rom-com I can pretty much see all the tropes and cliches from miles away.\nEven though this manga was some what generic I did find myself some what entertained.\nLike the over the top hijixs where fun but that really is it.\n\n\n\nOverall, 5/10\n\nSo overall koharu no hibi is pretty a generic slice of life rom-com that is a little different.\nSo if you haven't read that many rom-coms then you should probably check this out.\n\nBut if you have any experience with any types of story's like this this then koharu no hibi will pretty much be a waste of time for you.\n"}, {"id": 2993, "score": 61, "body": "Waring this review may contain spoilers.\n\nFirst impressions, so we got harem show where people fight for half price bento's and there is some heram shit going down sounds fun enough.\nSide note a bento is a Japanese lunch box in case you didn't know that.\n\n\nStory, 6/10\n\nSo bento is about the main character who goes to a shop to get himself some half price bento. But then gets his ass kicked by a girl when he try's to get one.\nAfter that he soon learns that one doesn't just simply get himself a half price bento one must earn it though honorable combat and blood shed. This contest of strength and willpower is known as the bento brawl where the wolfs get to fed and the dogs go home hungry. \n\nSo to sunrise bento it pretty much about these group of people who beat the living shit out of each other for what is essentially half price food, and I thinking to myself man this is really stupid this will never work and to my amazement I find that this actually works.\nNow I am not saying that this best story ever made because it's extremely simplistic in both ideas and presentation. but I think what makes it work is that it takes the battle shounen mentality and compressed it into one of the most mundane of tasks which is shopping.\n\nThis show also includes some harem/school life elements as well \nAnd your properly thinking that it's going to be one of those things where the main character a bata male and has all these badass girls protecting him well if you thought that then your wrong because it more like they kick his ass and then he kicks there ass and they become apart of his harem so it's like a reverse Kung fu harem and the school life parts are self explanatory.\n\nOne thing I think is quite fun about this show is that \nFor one the characters seem to take this whole bento brawl thing very seriously. For example you got characters having monologues about honor and way of the warrior type of shit.\n\nBut a negative I got to say about it is that it really doesn't have any type of logic to it and that kind thing kind of bothered me a bit. So pretty much turn off your brain while watching this show.\n\n\n\n\nCharacters, 6/10\n\nThe main character can be pretty much be sum up as the normal high school student who is a bit of a pervert and likes old school games and is a bit bata male at first.\nbut after a while he starts becoming a bit of a badass in his own way \n\nThe side characters are pretty much two dimensional at the most.\n\nBut they are quite the interesting bunch of ....... no interesting isn't really the word I would use probably I should use the word zany so the are a zany bunch of characters.\n\nThey all have some personally even though it's really basic.\n\n\n\n\nArt, 7/10\n\nThe animation was very well done it isn't at that God level of animation quality but it looks very nice.\nIt also has very bright colors that is uses.\n\nIt also has some very well done fight animation as well.\n\nIt has a very genneric art style that you seen it once you seen it all.\n\nThe characters designs are also generic as well.\n\n\nSound, 6/10 \n\nIt has an ok op that fits the tone nicely.\n\nIt's ost to me is pretty generic. nothing really stands out about the ost.\n\n\n\nEnjoyment, 7/10 \n\nSo this show some what blowed me away of how fun this show was.\n\nI like that it's got people fighting over stupid shit.\n\n\nI also liked the really cool steet fighting.\n\nI also found the characters to be fun as well.\n\n\nOverall, 6/10\n\nSo overall if your looking a dumb fun anime then you will find bento to be one kick ass of a show.

So when I started reading this I was kind of getting the vibes of some thing like usagi drop but with super natural elements. \nBut I am afraid that the story didn't take that route. So your probably thinking that i had a problem with how the story actually played out and I didn't because I was kind of expecting it to take the path it did because at the end of the day this a shojo story with all that good shojo shit like romance,the feels, melodrama.\n\nSo the story is pretty much about this romance that starts to develop between vivi and Hana.\nWell develop isn't the right word for it it's more like coming to turms with your feelings and how you should enjoy the times that you have spent with some one because they will not last for ever. \nThe few problems I had with the romance are.\nThat it is kind of one of those romances that from the get go that you can tell it going to have a sad or bittersweet ending unless we have a asspull. Which thankfully it doesn't so it \nBut the ending isn't the problem it's just that you have characters reminding vivi that Hana is going to die in about 100 years time and that vivi shouldn't take up a relationship with a human because it will end up is sadness in the end.\n\nThe other problem I have is that it kind of raises the kinky factor a bit up in the romance department because vivi is 200 year old demon and Hana is a 14 year old human. So it looks like that they where trying to go with the most consensual loli con kisses.\nAlso like most shojo super natural romance story's it has a lot of those oh dose he love me or not moments in it which really did piss me off a bit.\nBut this is a shojo story and quite a lot of them are like that so its more a nit pick than a problem.\n\n\nCharacters, 6/10\n\nThe main heroine Hana was some what interesting because of the fact that she was raised by demons and Also the fact the she doesn't know much about the outside world. Though they don't do much with it. Her personality is Kind of what you would expect from a person who has been pretty much sheltered from the out side world and didn't have much contact from humans.\nThe main protagonist vivi is of interesting with his whole demon background but they really don't use it to it full potential. His personality is taht can be summarized as the asshole-ish type character who kind of dose what he wants and lives by his whims.\n\nThe side characters where also kind of interesting as well.\nMost of them has something different about them that made them stand out a bit.\nLike for example you got this demon who is really into cats and has made some sort of magic that can add cats ears on people.\nThey where quite enjoyable to watch. But they could have used more fleshing out so they could of be more interesting. \n\n\n\nArt, 7/10\n\nSo the art was quite well done for shojo standards.\n\nThat art style is a cute-ish shojo art style that is quite dated if you have read shojo that use this kind of art style.\n\nThe character designs are pretty much like most shojo.\nLike every one is handsome and pretty. \nThere are people with every interesting fancy outfits.\n\n\nEnjoyment, 7/10\n\nSo even though I am not really the demographic for this kind of story.\nBecause this is the kind of story that Is geared toward the female demographic.\nBut even. Though it is I did find it very sweet and the ending made me cry on the inside of course. So I found this a some what a enjoyable ride for shojo standards.\n\n\n\nOverall, 6/10 \n\nNow if your into a sweet romance story with all the feels and shit like that. Then you will find that Hana to akuma will be your cup of tea.\n\nBut if you're not into the whole feels crap then this will become a very boring read \n"}, {"id": 2998, "score": 51, "body": "Warning this review may contain spoilers.\n\n\nFirst impressions, so we got a super natural marrder mystery going down with harem elements going in the background. Sounds interesting enough.\n\n\nStory,5/10 \n\nSo the premise and setup of choas head is pretty simple for the most part because in one way or another it's has been done before a lot of time.\nYou know Like we have the main character living his Madame life. There are some mysterious murders that have been going down in his local area. He doesn't pay attention to these things and then out of nowhere he is then quickly dragged into the middle of it.\nwith him now trying to figure out what has been going on and finding out that things are more than they appear and him also finding out that he's got got super natural powers that give him the ability to make his imagination real and along the way finding out that there some girls who also have the same power as him. \n\nWhich now in retrospect this kind of thing has been kind of done before and some times better in the choas head case. \nNow I am not saying that choas head is bad in any way. Because I thought it was quite interesting for what it was because it tackles some interesting concepts, like how realty can change so quickly or how you shouldn't trust everything you see and how do you describe the concept of something that as real for not.\nWhich is really something you don't see that very often.\n\nBut the problem I have with chaos head as a whole is that it's presentation was very disappointing in quite a few areas. I am pretty sure and don't quote me on this I am pretty \nsure that the presentation in the visnel novel that this was based off was a lot better. But problems I have for one is that the pacing is very fast. \n\n\nFrom a nartive stand point it feels like to me that it's hip hoping to every major plot point in about 12 episodes. \nWhich kind of kills all build up and because of the small amount of episodes the show never had time for cool down moments or side story's to help flesh out the setting. \n\nOne of the things that the anime did get right when it came to presentation was the creepy atmosphere because this a story about mystery and murder.\n\nNow another problem I had as the ending because it was very wft and it is one of those open endings where you don't know what really happens next. \n\n\nCharacters, 6/10\n\nThe main character taku was some what interesting.\nLike his personality wasn't that special because he was a shut-in otaku who really doesn't have much of a personality. But what made him interesting was his mental problems which his ability kind of made it more fun because you don't really know if any off the things that he is seeing are real or something that he is thinking off.\n\n\nThe side characters.\nWhere also kind of interesting in way as well.\nBecause they all had something interesting about them.\n\nlike for example one of the characters mostly speaks in cryptic word play.\nA different character who was also interesting as a girl who only speaks using ner mind. \n\nEven though there personallys are genetic as hell.\n\nOne problem I found was the character relationships.\n\nBecause of the pacing and ep count we never these characters come together naturally.\n\nNow You could say that to some extent that they became closer together because they shared a common enemy that was a huge threat and because of that they became closer.\nBut doesn't really justify the fact that some of where some what close to him even though thay had only know him for a short time.\n\n\nArt, 6/10\n\nNow animation for choas head for the most part looks very nice for the most part.\n\nIt has some very nice backgrounds.\n\nIt also has a nice colors as well.\n\n\n\nSound, 6/10\n\nThe quite liked the op and ending themes \nThey where quite nice to listen to.\nBut they not really worth looking for.\n\nThe ost well kind of lacking for the part on its own. \nBut it did bring the right atmosphere to every scene that showed up in the anime.\n\n\nEnjoyment, 6/10\n\nWell on of the things I quite liked was the idea behind it. \nBecause on Paper this would have been a really good idea if it was presented better.\nI liked it's idea of realty being contently put in a state of Mind fuck.\n\nI also quite enjoyed the creep atmosphere.\n\nBut pacing and ep count did put a major dampening of how I enjoyed is show. Because \nWhile watching this show it really did feel that it was missing something more to it.\n\n\n\nOverall, 5/10\n\nIf your into v.n anime adaptation then you will probably like it even though it feels a like fan service for v.n players.\n\nBut if you not into gennic story's in general and you do t like gore or maid fuck then stay a way. \nBut you like the idea of choas head.\nYour probably better off playing the game. "}, {"id": 2999, "score": 62, "body": "Warning this review may contain spoilers.\n\nFirst impression, so my first impressions where along the lines of ok so this is about some guy with amnesia who gets involved in the civil war to overthrow the current emperor so this going to be some sort of war epic sounds promising enough.\n\n\nStory, 6/10.\n\nSo the premise of Utawarerumomo.\nstarts off pretty simple With the protagonist haku who is found badly injured by a local village girl and is taken in by the local villagers while he recovers from his injuries and also amnesia. While under the care of the local villagers a local \"noble\" causes some big trouble for the villages which in turn though a series of events helps kick start a massive rebellion against the local emperor with the main character leading this rebellion and eventually he becomes the new emperor with him now Running this country and dealing with the problems of those who bear the role of leader have to deal with.\n\nSo the story of utawareumomo is basically a slice of life how to run a kingdom/ war drama / harem because this is based of an hentai game.\nAnd your now probably asking please explain so very well I will explain.\n\nNow the reason I say slice of life is because about half the time it is basically that.\nThere are literally parts of this show where people are basically doing jack shit nothing except doing paper work, Having meetings, getting drunk and Other madame things.\nAnd to me these parts did get a bit tedious at times. But in retrospect it dose help with the setup of the the war drama aspects because when I think about it these nothing really is happening moments are used to make you and the characters drop their guard and then out of nowhere there is an attack and your like oh crap.\n\nThe war dama parts are for the most part taken very seriously.\nWhich I can always appreciate when a story take the concept of war with the kind of seriousness it needs.\nThere is tactics involved, there is also lots of death that they actually show you, there are parts where villagers are getting pillaged and burned to the ground.\n\nThese parts are kind of used to help learn about the world this takes place in and more about the main character past.\n\nWhere we find out that this isn't a fantasy world. but is in actually a post apocalyptic earth in the future where humanity fuck up to point where thay couldn't live on earth any more and that the main character is a God like being. \nWhich begs the question of how did humans end up in that state like this and how come we have magic in a world that seems it was made by science but at the same time is a fantasy world with I shit you not angel like being that can do magic and the main character who has god like abilities. That make little to no sense of how this all connected.\nSo what I am trying to say in that thay never really expands on it and it's just comes out disjointed. \n\n\nNow last and not least is the reason why a say there is a harem element in the show.\nNow some of you are probably going to say or think the that the harem aspect of the story kind of brings down the serious nature of this story.\nBut to my shock it didn't do that really.\nBecause for one it really doesn't much of a prescience. its kind of just there for you to enjoy and easy going. \nAesthetically it kind of fits because this world that the live in is lightly based of medieval Japan and if you read any history books you would probably know that emperors in history getting harems happen quite a lot So it more of a favoring than any thing else.\n\nAlso if you where looking for fan service there really isn't that much of it.\n\nNow the ending kind of came out of nowhere but it was fore shadowed enough that could have it not bother me that much. Even though it did kind of end open.\n\n\n\nCharacters, 5/10\n\nThe main character haku was some what interesting.\nhe is a naturally good leader who also likes women which kind makes interesting a bit.\nBut the problem is that he has amnesia and it kind of makes him a little bland at times. But at the same time it dose lead him to deal with a lot of issues like who he was or what has he done in life and what not.\n\n\nThe side characters are pretty one note.\nBecause I can pretty much sum up most of the characters in sentence.\n\nBecuse most of the characters are mostly defined though only a few personally trats.\n\nFor example there one character who I can sum up as the lawful good warrior type of character. So yah they can be pretty much be summarized pretty quickly.\nSo the characters are kind of written poorly.\nBut I do believe that the character interaction helps make up with it.\nBecause I did find the character interaction enjoyable to watch. \n\n\nArt, 6/10\n\nThe animation is kind of average even when I compare it to other shows that came out that same year. But at the Same time it dose add some grit to it which kind of works because this is a show about war so I give it a pass for that.\n\nIt's art style is kind of generic\nNothing really special here.\n\nNow the character designs where Kind of different but still generic.\nLike it kind of fun to see all these animal people designs.\nBut it still has the problem of being dated.\n\n\nSound, 5/10\n\nNow the op and ending themes were catchy but I am afraid that is all they are is catchy.\n\nAnd the ost is kind of forgettable. Like for the life of me I can't really remember much of it.\nSo if your looking for a ost you should definitely pass on this you won't get my much out of it. \n\nEnjoyment, 6/10\nNow when it came to the enjoyment of this show I guess I can mention a few things.\nOne thing I quite like about this show is how serious it was and how ambitious it was for a hentai game story.which did find make it a pretty interesting ride over all.\n\n\nOverall, 6/10\nIf your looking a for above average war drama then utawarumono will be a pretty good ride.\nBut if the lack of characters and art and sound bothers your the you should probably go watch something else.\n"}, {"id": 3000, "score": 50, "body": "Warning this review may contain spoilers.\n\nFirst impressions, so we got an anime the is known as the final destination of anime.\nSounds interesting enough what could possibly go wrong?\n\n\nStory, 4/10\n\nSo the premise of another are main character going to this new school were he finds out that the class room he is in has a curse That will take place every year that kill one student and his relatives once every month and the only way to stave off the curse from happening again for a year is to completely ignore the existence of one of your follow classmate intill the year is over.\nSo my thoughts on this where, oh my god there is a school that has a mysterious curse that will kill all the students. where haven't I herd that before.\nThis premise alone basically screams a generic horror story with a mysterious curse and people we don't give a fuck about die'in left and right And for the most part that is basically how it plays out.\n\nSo the story is basically about the main character that pretty much kick started of the curse by mistake and him trying to figure out about the mysterious curse.\nWhich is really for me where the show took a nosedive.\n\nBecause as you find out more about this mysterious curse the more it make less sense.\nBecause they never explain any thing about this curse like where it came from or what's is the reason it is happening. \nWhich is really stupid because if you have seen any horror movie that involve curses for example like a witch as hanged and she placed a curse on the people that wronged her and then like 400 years later a group of people get involved and then try to brake this curse and shit like that.\n\nBut another doesn't really do any of that.\nBecause these characters do nothing proactive to stop this curse at all.\nall they ever do is try to stop it from starting and then reacting when the curse starts taking effect and go bat shit crazy by the end of it and try to kill one another to stop the curse.\nWhich doesn't work out very well in retrospect. \n\nAnd I got to ask this question why dose this school willingly let students go into a class room that they know is cursed? So Is closing down a class room and having a little bit of classroom overcrowding that hard to deal with.\n\nSo as a horror story it really dose fail becuase it never really explains itself probably. \nBecause literally this is what they explain apparently a girl died and then after her death the curse starts going off and this curse brings back a person from the dead I shit you not and if you don't ignore the existence of one off your follow class mates the curse will start killing people and the only way to end the curse for the that year is to kill the person who has been brought back from the dead.\n\nSo seems ligt. \n\nNow some say this is tragic and sad but I couldn't really agree with that.\nBecause this story is forced as fuck literally And your thinking to yourself what type of story isn't forced. But this show is highly guilty of this.\nBecause for some reason they have students who are on the curse prevention duty and yet none of them came up with the brilliant idea of just closing down this classroom.\nBecause being proactive is so bloody hard and Just to add to my point the show even admit it self because at the end the two characters left standing after thay brake the curse.\nJust deside to continue like nothing ever fucking happened. Oh what main character you going to do some thing what is that. Oh your going to remember them the people who died so not telling the school to close that classroom down that makes sense.\n\n\n\nCharacters, 5/1O\n\nThe main character is pretty much bland as toast.\n\nThere is absolutely no personality and is pretty much genenic as all fuck.\nHe is pretty much there to be the average joe.\nYou would think that all the shit he goes though you would think that he would change.\nBut it seems that he is never completely bothered by what is happening.\n\nThe side characters are also bland and generic.\nThey are pretty much cardboard cut outs that we are superpose to care about.\nBut you can't care about people that you now are going to die and have no personality. \nYet for some reason they try to have moments where they have the character interaction that try's to add personality but that in the long run is going to go to waste because they had no personality to begin with and the fact they are al going to die is horrible ways.\n\n\nArt, 6/10\n\nThe animation for another was quite polished and clean.\nWhich kind of bothered me because I think that a more gritty animation would have fit the story more.\n\nThe backgrounds where nice done nothing god tir but they did an ok job.\n\nThe color scheme for this anime is very grim which fits the show quite nicely.\n\nThe art style is pretty much the by the book set style that you have pretty much seem almost very where. So its generic.\nThe character designs are also generic as well.\n\n\n\nSound,6/10\n\nThe op theme song is catchy. but I personally never took to it.\nThe ending song is quite relaxing but other than that there really isn't much to it.\n\nNow the ost as quite different because it really did add to the atmosphere of the story.\n\nWhich is quite nice. So I give them props for that.\n\n\nEnjoyment 5/10\n\nFor me personally I really liked the over the top death scenes.\nBecause I am really am the gore fan and plus when I think about it the death scenes are really over the top which kind of makes them funny. \n\nI also love the 11-12 episodes because it literally turns into a massive blood bath with people freak out and start killing each other. \nWhich turned this show from a horror to for me to a comedy for me. \n\n\nOverall,5/10\n\nAnother is a generic horror story and if you like horror and gore then this will be your cup of tea.\n\nBut if your looking for more than just senseless gore then you will be unhappy with poor characters and overall bad writing.\n"}, {"id": 3001, "score": 63, "body": "Warning this review may contain spoilers.\n\nFirst impressions, so after watching the sub par anime version of this manga that left me with a really bad taste in my mouth it did make me want to know how the manga of was and I must admit that this was quite better. Even though this is a generic battle harem.\n\n\nStory, 6/10\n\nThe story of Rosario vampire starts of with are main character tsukane who has flanked his entry exams into high school but luckily his parents find a flyer for a private school known as yokai academy that will happily take in students regardless of you academics. \nSo with little other choice they decide to send Him to this school.\nLittle did he now that this will school change his life forever So on his first day of school he runs into a another student name moka who he befriends after that he finds out that moka is a vampire and that this is a school For monsters so they can fit in with human society and with a no humans allowed rule. So now tsukane must band together with moka and his new monster friends to help him survive in this monster only school.\n\nSo you kind of tell this pretty much that this going to be a generic by the books school life battle harem. which for the most part it is and plays out like one.\nbut what is a bit different about it is that it definitely takes an interesting spin on it.\nAnd I am no saying that it completely different because it's pretty much starts off with the Same formula that you have seem time and time again being milked to death in most battle harems. \nYou know guy meets girl, guy gets involved in some pretty intense shit , guy will eventually accidentally start developing a harem around him, guy will start developing super natural powers.\n\nIt also doesn't help that for the start is kind of episodeic and very ber bones to say the least. \nEven though its dose gets more intense in plot later on.\nTo explain its pretty much follows this monster of the week formula.\nWith the main character who is trying to fit in at this monster school with all the school slice of life stuff and every new weeks he gets involved into situations with some of his follow students at first. But as time goes on he starts getting into more intense situations like the sudent police force finding out that he maybe a human and attempted to kill him which didn't work out Because of moka giving him temporary vampire powers which helps him survive and helps gets the Student police off his ass. \nBut this Does led him to more dangerous situations of monster fighting him with him getting more temporary vampire powers which eventually take there toll on his body and he eventually starts becoming a monster himself and the story basically becomes him trying to protect his friends and aiming for his goal of human and monster coexistence while trying to keep his humanity intact.\n\nNow the ending of this isn't really the ending its just because of reasons they had to brake it up into parts so this is the ending for part one so if you want to see the full story go read part 2.\n\nNow even though I have seen this kind of story telling done before and in some cases better.\nI did find this enjoyable and fun interesting to a point.\n\nLike with the different types of monsters with there powers that made the fights quite interesting even though most of the they are pretty repetitive because unofficial girl frend dose most of the fighting for him. Which is kind of a shame because they could have used some tactics but luckily some of the opposition become quite strong and some times they Will have to use team work in order to beat them so that quite nice.\n\nAother thing that is interesting about it is that it dose tackle some Racal Themes about human and monster coexistence. \nWhich could been done better If thay really went into detail with it instead of using it for nakama speeches and power ups.\n\nAnother thing thing which story wise strong about it is the relationship that starts slowly developing between tsukane and moka. Which is some aspects is kind of forced but they use there relationship to open up more plot lines later on. \nAnd it's not one of oh you a human I am a vampire we can never love each other.\nIt's more oh we get along its see where this leads to.\n\n\nCharacters, 6/10\n\nThe main character tsukane for the most part starts off like most harem protagonist.\nYou know not much of a personality he pretty much the average joe. \n\nBut what is strong about him in particular is that he dose though some slow character development and fleshing out. Which starts turning him from band self inert to him gradually becoming more alpha and becoming more useful.\nAnother thing that was good about his character was a bit of this inner conflict which they never bring it up again which is a wasted opportunity.\nFor example there is this one chapter where he starts craveing to drink moka blood. Which they could have brought up a really cool concept of him at times slowly loosening his humanity. \n\nThe side characters are quite generic at the start and are pretty much the normal stereotypes you would find in meny battle harem story's. \nBut like the main character the start having some fleshing out and development which starts makeing them two dimensional at the most.\nAlso personally are quite fun as well.\n\nFor example there is this one character who is a succbus who of corse in love with the main character. And some of you who have herd the world succbus you probably thank that she going to be a stereotypical whore character who will trying every trick in the book to get the D but she doesn't use her powers to win him over because she believes that this isn't fair to the other girls and also the fact she wants to instead win him with love and not use cheap tricks to win him over and I am thinking man that quite deep and a good reason for doing what she doing.\n\nAnother thing that kind of sold me with the characters was also the character interaction watch was quite funny to watch.\n\nNo one thing that is negative is that Most of the villains are very one note.\nSo don't expect some good villains.\n\n\nArt, 7/10\n\nThe artwork started off kind of poor at first, it did look very cartoonish. But after a bit it's starts getting more details and it's starts looking very sharp and clear. It also has some pretty good fight scenes as well.\n\nIt's has a very shounen art style to it if that makes any sense.\nTo explain more clearly if you have seen quite a bit of shounen you should get the idea of what I am going on about.\n\nIts character design are kind of fedishy based.\n\nBut one thing that really dose stand out is the monster designs.\nBecause they look very well done.\nI can tell that person who made these designs had a lot of fun making and bringing them to life.\n\n\nEnjoyment, 7/10\n\nso like I have seid before even though I found this to be quite genetic.\n\nI must admit that I did like it because I found this story to have some magic to it.\n\nI also liked the whole school for monsters it was kind of remind me of hogwarts from Harry Potter. I thought for a school battle harem that was an interesting place to have this stuff take place.\n\n\nOverall, 6/10\n\nSo overall even though this is kind a generic harem story. It is probably one of the better ones out there and if you like battle shounen,harem,super natural, you will probably enjoy this one.\nNow if your not into haram then you wil probably won't enjoy this as much and there are other story's that doing everything that this has done but done it better."}, {"id": 3002, "score": 61, "body": "Warning this review may contain spoilers.\n\nFirst impressions, so when I was first getting into anime this was probably one of the first v.n romance, harem shows I ever watched. So I didn't really know what to expect. and for most part it was all right for what was.\n\n\n\n\nStory,6/10\n\nSo the premise of shuffle is pretty much about are bland main character who lives in a world where demons and Gods live peacefully with humanity. So while going to his school where Gods,demons,humans go together. He is given the opportunity of a life time to ether become the king of the gods or king of the demons by marrying one of of the princess who of course likes him because they meet him when they where children.\n\nSo from this you can tell it's going to be one of those happy if it's not broke don't fix it kind of harem plots where very thing is pretty idealistic and very thing is peachy as all hell.\nSo some of you are Probably thinking to yourself what's the point of watching this if everything is so happy go lucky. Dose that mean there is probably not going to be any drama to it and it's going to be a waste of time for someone like me that likes there rom-com's to be a bit more serious . Well if you said that to yourself then I have good news this is exactly what your are looking for if Your looking for something that takes itself seriously enough.\nNow you're probably thinking how can this be if everything is happy and idealistic you must be trolling bio gundam please explain why you are saying theses thing.\nOh ok will.\n\nSo shuffle for the first half plays out like a generic v.n rom-com harem school life.\nWe have the Male lead who is bland as fuck who convent starts getting a few girls that of course like Him and they go on all the usual slice of life, harem bullshit.\nLike going on a few dates, going to beach together with his not harem group, doing school thing with them, and last and not lease the \"not\"on purpose fan service.\nSore zzzzzzz sore sore zzzzzzzzzzz sore zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz sore zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.\nBio Gundam you were trolling this isn't serious at all reported the mods need to know about this.\nWait wait you didn't let me finish, oh sorry there. \nSo the first part is pretty much sore city because if you have seen enough of v.n anime you will pretty much find this exact same plot beet for this.\n\nBut where the story starts getting better from the point of v.n rom-com harem school life standards.\n\nIs the second half which starts getting a lot more serious.\nBecause we get some much needed back story which explains why there girls like him and some drama about the harem girls.\nFor example one of them become very sick and almost to the point of death.\nAnother one being that one of the girls has a mental breakdown because of choices that the main character made.\n\nWhich helps make the main character realizes that he can't just have his cake and eat it to. That choices he makes has actual consequences and he has to fix them himself.\nWhich adds a sense of realism that I believe that this series shares with the more realistic comparably speaking show school days that is willing to acknowledge the fact that when you try to have your cake and eat it to there is going to be consequences. \nOf course shuffle never took as far as school days did.\nBut it's took itself seriously enough that you could take everything as serious.\n\nNow the ending is petty much the most disappointing part of it because the girl he chosen is sick and is going to die if they don't do something. so the protagonist saves her and then the girls act like nothing happened like for example one of them saying the he has chosen a girlfriend but not a bride so we still have a chance.\n\nAnd I like Oh shit it's going to restart all over again fuck.\n\nAnother problem that this story has is that by today's standard it's very dated and also story telling like this pretty much helped kick start the decline of anime.\nSo dated is my biggest problem with it.\nBut it is well paced for a v.n. And it is probably one the better presented v.n anime.\n\n\n\nCharacters, 6/10\n\nThe main character is pretty much your by the book v.n protagonist.\nWho just happens to have life served to him on a plate literally.\nHis personality can be summarized in about on sentence\nHe is pretty much the nice guy and nothing else.\nBut one thing I have to give him credit on is that he makes the choice of what he is in love with. And also him realizing that he can't take these girls for granted. So he stands out a bit for just that.\n\nThe side characters are pretty much one note.\n\nExcept some of the harem girls because all of them I have an ok back story which dose add some depth to them.\nAlso when you see these back stories in detail you can kind of understand why they would like the main character\n\nFor an example One of the harem girls who he lives with pretty much does everything for him and at the start your probity thinking why is she like this. She probably there for waifu bait.\nBut when you see her back story it's makes a lot more sense why she does this. Because of a certain event that the Main character took the blame for And she treated him like trash for most of his life because of the event that he took the blame for. But after finding out the truth which the Main character was hiding for her own good she starts doing everything in her power to make the main character happy Because she feels guilty for all the bullshit she put him though. And I am like damn this is an actual good reason for doing this shit.\n\n\n\nArt,6/10\n\nThe animation was pretty average at best. Even buy the standards of the year it came out.\n\nThe style is pretty much the generic Style number 452282222929 that has been used countless times.\n\nThe characters designs are pretty much generic v.n novel designs with fantasy flavoring to make it look different. \n\nThe colors for this anime are pretty much bright which fits with the tone of the show.\n\nSound, 6/10\n\nOp and ending was pretty nice to listen to.\nIt not sound take worthy but it was quite a nice listen.\nSo worth checking out. \n\nThe ost for me was pretty forgettable.\n\nSo if you're into getting ost then you will probably not find anything else of interest here.\n\n\nEnjoyment, 6/10\n\nNow even though shuffle is generic as all hell.\nWith all the bland storytelling that has been milked to death in recent years.\n\nBut what I really enjoyed about it that for the most part took itself seriously.\n\nAnd it had a conclusion to its romance.\n\nWhich most story's like this don't have.\n\n\nOverall,6/10\n\nSo overall if you like v.n,harem,school life that take themselves a little seriously then shuffle is what you are looking for.\n\nBut If you have seen enough of stories like this then you will it pretty generic and dated.\nAnd probably overall not worth your time.\n"}, {"id": 3006, "score": 61, "body": "Warning this review may contain spoilers.\n\nFirst impressions, so my thoughts where ok this is probably going to a generic light novel harem show with probably a few interesting or entertaining about it.\nI was getting a feeling that this show is going kind of like a certain magical index and for the most it kind of was. \n\n\n\nStory, 5/10\n\nSo the story of strike the blood is basically like most generic light novel harem story's like for example a certain magical index or Shakugan no Shana.\nBut to go into more detail what the story is actually about.\nThe story's Starts off with are main kojou akatsuki who though a series of events becomes a vampire while he is living in the demon district of itogami city which is a man made island of the cost of Japan where super natural beings known as D types,(which are basically vampires, demons and what ever else)\nthat live side by side with humans. Which is happening because of a treaty between humanity and the three vampires known progenitors who rule over certain areas of the world.\n\nWe then find out that that kojou is no ordinary vampire, big shocker there \nbut a vampire known as progenitor.\nHe is known as the infamous forth progenitor which is a title that is basically demonetized as an agent of chaos which seeks to destroy the Balance of the world and what not.So while trying to hide the fact he not longer human or this progenitor vampire.\nHe then finds out that he is being watched by an agent of the secret organization lion king named yukina himeragi a sword shaman apprentice, god that's a mouth full.\nWho has been tasked to watch him and to kill him if he ever becomes a threat to the stats quo. Even though from what I have seen he seems that he only a threat to the purity of the local girl population that seem to throw them selfs at him but that besides the point.\nSo basically the story is about the day to day adventures of kojou and yukina.\nWhich are pretty much the cliche of day to day adventures which nothing much interesting about them. You got evil corporation, terrorists and people who want to blow up shit because reasons. \nBasically what happens in the story is that things are pretty normal you all the school life and harem what not then shit goes down with some bad guys then main character drinks another girl blood gets power up and then beets bad guy and repeat and that is the plot in a nutshell.\n\nNow I don't have much of a problem with this kind of bare bones story.\nBecause even story's like this have sort of charm to them and strike the blood seems perfectly fine being just that.\nWhich is fine because at lest it being honest about what it actually is unlike shows like sword art online or shakugan no shana which tried to make it seem more deeper than it actually was. Because when you pull back the layers you can see for what it is plan as day a generic light novel harem show.\nBut the flip side to that It's very generic and full of the usual tropes and cliches.\nI think in retrospect what could have made this show stand out more is that it of been about the main character slowly building his own kingdom from the ground up or makeing some sort of name for himself While picking up more chicks In between.\nWouldn't that be more interesting.\nBecause This lion king organization is afraid that he going to do that.\nPlus in the anime it has been confirmed at the end of the anime that he dose actually build himself an actual kingdom in the future. \n\n\nCharacters, 5/10\n\nThe main character kojou is pretty bland to say the lest when it comes to his personality. He basically the nice guy which you should never ever piss off.\nBecause when his wifus get hurt then shit is going down.\nBut I guess one good thing about is that he quite intelligent and try's to figure out ways to deal with his opponents so I will give props to that.\n\nThe side character are pretty much the usual harem stereotypes.\n\nYou got the love interest, you got the child hood friend and etc. \n\nNow even though they where pretty generic for the most part I had quite a bit of fun watching the character interactions.\n\n\nArt, 6/10 \n\nThe animation was ok for the most part.\nNothing amazing about it, but at the same time it isn't a bad looking show.\n\nThe art style is pretty generic nothing really stands out.\n\nThe character design are also generic.\n\n\nSound, 5/10\n\nBoth op and end songs didn't really stand out that much to me.\nBut I think the only one I liked was probably the second op because it had an ok beet to it. But other than very thing else was pretty forgettable for me.\n\nSo if you like ost you probably not going to find any thing of interest here.\nBut you know ost are subjective so there may be something that may have your attention.\n\nEnjoyment, 6/10\n\nKnow even though I found this show quite generic in retrospect.\n\nI did find it quite entertaining.\n\nI kind of like that even for today's stands it pretty tame for a harem which meet I wasn't always going to have boobs in my face all the god dam time.\nPlus I also like how straight forward it is in story and characters which kind of makes it relaxing to watch. \nWhich is quite funny because this show has quite a bit of action in it.\n\n\nOverall, 6/10\n\nIf your new to anime then I think that strike the blood would be a pretty ok show to help you get into anime more, because it is quite generic with all the usual tropes and cliches that you would find in there types of story's so it a very good entry level show.\n\nNow if your an experienced anime watcher then probably stay away.\nBut if your into harems and all that good stuff and what to watch strike the blood for that you can probably find it better else where in another show.\n"}, {"id": 3009, "score": 62, "body": "Warning this review may contain spoilers.\n\nFirst impressions, so my first thoughts on this was ok this probably going to be the next generic light novel anime this season and the most part it kinda is.\nBut the show dose something a little different that really took me off my guard.\n\n\nStory, 6/10\n\nSo chivalry of a failed knight on the surface seems like the next generic light novel anime with a school and teens with super powers.\nBut what I told that it does something a little different from the norm.\n\"Oh really please explain\" \n\"Sure thing\"\n\nSo are story begins with the usual set up \nWith are Main character lkki kurogane who is a Blazer and the blazer is basically this world version of people with super powers that uses magic.\nIkki goes to a very prestigious school known as Hagun academy In order to be a Mage knight. But the problem with ikki is that he is ranked the weakest student at the school because of his low abilities when it comes to the magic and other things with him having the degrading nick name \"the worst one\" and basically treated like shit be most people around him.\nSo after returning from his daily training who comes across a half naked girl named Stella vermillion who is a princess from a different country Who came here to study.\nSo after trying to talk to the headmaster of the school \nThe to of them decide to have a dual in order to sort things out where the looser is the winner slave for life.\nWhich ends in the usual way with the main character completely beating her.\nWhile she is recovering from her fight she learns that her and ikki have a lot more in common than she first believed.\nBecause she has also had a similar experience to what ikki has gone though but from the completely opposite side.\nand so begins there adventure of working together in order to rech there dreams.\n\nWhich can be helped by entering the seven start sword art festival which is a inter school tournament which is student fighting each other between other schools.\nWhich is done by the strongest students of each school. Which is also decided by a tournament of some sort.\n\nSo the story is basically ikki and Stella fighting there way to the top of there school In order to get to this torment with them fighting opposition of the week \nand the usual shit in between.\nfor example they fight some sort of terrorist group in one ep and in another part is where there basically doing regular school activities and some sort of romance that's going down.\nWhich sounds pretty bare bones. \n\nBut as you continue watching you start to notice.\nthat not what it's all about.\nIt is actually about an under dog story done right about the Main character and few others characters as they try to slowly change the system around them for the better.\nAs they try to point out the flaws and hypocrisy of the system around them. \nBecause in this society if you have low magic power your basically trash and people with high magic power can kind of do what they want.\nFor an example of this we find out that ikki is part of a prestigious clan of magic knights. Who after finding out ikki condition basically ignore is existence and continue to try and stop him from becoming a magical knight and even when ikki left his home and managed to get into this school in order to become a magic knight by the skin of his teeth. \nStill unable to take part in classes because the kurogane clan basically got the school head master at the time to change the rules so he won't Be Able to past his classes.\nAnd for a whole year he was basically in a no win situation at his school.\nBut though strong will and determination he continued to try and get stronger.\nBut now an opportunity has presented its self.\nWith the new headmaster that has told ikki that in order for him to become a magical knight and reach his dreams he must win the seven star sword festival for his school.\nAnd that is basically what the story is about.\nWhich is quite interesting because I never expected something with actual deepth in a light novel anime.\nBasically this is a story that subverts all expectations when it comes to the generic light novel type story's.\n\nNow it nothing ground braking.\nBut at the end of the day it kind of refreshing in a way that they decided to take it.\nEspecially with the writing.\nBecause it has a sort of self awareness to it.\nWhich doesn't mean that's it good because it self awareness because it doesn't do much with it. But it has a sense of charm to.\n\nFor example there is this one scene where ikki is telling Stella that is Little sister is going to be at school and she sied to him your not going to tell me that you guys aren't related by blood or something like that with him reply no we are related by blood and then she says ok that's fine.\nWith that scene there basically saying yes we know what type of series this.\n\nAnother thing that makes the story stand out from the norm.\nIs the fact that there is an romance that actually goes some where for a change.\nBecause it nice to see the moan character pick a girl and stick with it.\nPlus they take seriously enough for you to by into it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacters, 6/10\n\nThe main character ikki actually has some sort of personality.\nBut what Made him stand out for me for example was his determination to continue fighting against a system that for most of his life pretty much backed him into a corner. Because he didn't have much magical abilities.\nLike his personally is pretty much this.\nHe is pretty much a calm and collected guys that is very noble at heart. \nAnother thing that also stands out from him is that we are also showing that there things that will get to him. \nFor example there is this one scene where he is so nervous about this fight with this one guy.\nBecause of an encounter with this person in the past that really made him really struggle at first with his big fight with him at first intil they managed to up him get back into his normal state of mind.\n\nStella also has some sort of personality as well.\nAt first she seems like a basic tsudare character type.\nBut like ikki there is more the Meets the eye with her and I am not saying she deep or anything like that. Because she isn't.\nBut she a pretty interesting back story which is quite relateble and her dynamic with ikki more than makes up for it.\nAlso she never felt like the carbon copy of what a tsudare is. \n\n\nOn the topic on there dynamic they have very close blond which eventually becomes love which at times a little rushed but very genuine. \nAnother thing which made there romance interesting as the fact that out of the both of them she is the more sexually promiscuous.\nwhich is something you don't see that often because generally it the male partner that is more of the pervert.\nFor an example. There is this one scene where they are in a log cabin in the woods and they are basically resting inside and both of them are basically half naked well you know hormones and the mood being set she asks ikki if he wants to have sex with her. Of course he turns it down because he is more of a traditionalist when it comes to matters of a sexual nature while Stella is not.\nWhich was quite interesting.\n\nNow I am going to go more in depth about to more characters because I believe that these to especially at the moment of doing this review need to be addressed.\n\nSo i am going to talk about is ikki little sister first.\nShizuku who has a massive brother complex.\nI know some of you are oh my god here we go again.\nBut unlike some shows that do this kind of trope mostly for comedy or fan serive in my experience. Which it kind of is but that's beside the point. \nThere is an actual good reason why she is like that. \nBecause she was probably one of the few members of ikki family that didn't treat him like shit. And when she found out about what her family members where doing to him she basically hates her family minus for brother and decides that she will become the subtitle for the love that he never received from his family. And has no problem show casing this is because I. One scene where it's the first time she had meet ikki in about 4 years she pushes him to the ground and kisses him in front of a large group of people and talks about her feels to her brother.\nEven though it kind of shallow they at lest have some sort of context to why she is like that.\n\n\nAnother character I want to talk about in a bit of detail is Alice.\nWho is basically a transgender or transsexual person (and don't quote me on this because I get confused on which on is which because I don't really care and plus I kind of forget the difference between trans- sexual and trans- gender people)\nAnd in most cases of anime I have seen with these kinds of character they are generally used as some sort of joke which when I think about it is kind of insulting\nTo people who are like that and to the character them selfs.\nBecause they could have been interesting if taking seriously enough.\nBut Alice on the other hand is actually taken seriously for the most part which was also somethings I didn't expect from this kind of story.\nAnd for the most he was quite the interesting character to watch.\n\n\nNow for the side characters that where for the most pretty average for the most part\nMost of them are pretty one note.\nSome of them where a bit more interesting than other that.\nNothing else really noteworthy.\n\n\nArt, 7/10\n\nThe animation was very well done.\nAll the back ground also like very nice.\nThey also have a very bright colors scheme.\nWhich actually changes when there some serious shit going down.\nBecause when characters are feeling depressed or there a lot of tension in the scene.\nThe world becomes red , black, gray and sometimes there some blue in there to.\nThey also like to use expressive animation when the come to what the characters are generally feeling.\nThere is also some very good fight choreography.\n\nIt has a very generic style to it.\n\nThe character designs are basically your run of the mill light novel designs.\n\n\n\n\nSound, 6/10\n\nThe quite enjoyed listening to bouts the opening song and ending song.\n\nBecause it kind of got my attention and it has a nice beat to it.\n\nThe ost was on point most of the time but nothing really standing out that much.\n\nBut I think that the op and end song are worth a quick listen.\n\n\n\nEnjoyment, 6/10\n\n\nSo when it came to this anime what I enjoyed.\nIs that it took the basic light novel formula and put actual effort Into it.\nAnd it was refreshing and quite endearing.\nEven though it had quite a few generic shit that kinds of bothered me it actually never felt like that. I also found this to be a good time passer as well.\n\n\n\nOverall. 6/10\n\nSo if your are new to anime or just starting to dive into more titles then check this show out because it's a very good entry level show.\n\nBut if your a veteran of anime or you think light novels is the cancer of anime then probably stay away."}, {"id": 3010, "score": 50, "body": "Warning this review may contain spoilers.\n\nFirst impressions, so we got a fantasy story about a demon king that has been brought back from the dead by a person who wishes to use his power to take over the world, sounds like your general plot for a generic.\n\nStory, 5/10\n\nThe story of tears of tiara.\nIs about this rouge priest from the holy empire named drwc.\nWho kidnapped the daughter the late leader of the geal clan who name is Rhiannon\nIn order to sacrifice her in a ritual so he can resurrect the demon king so he can take over the world. After her brother named Arthur finds this out he and rest of the clan run to her rescue. But they where to late as the demon king arawn has all ready resurrected by the time they got there. \nWith drwc thinking that his plans for world domination are about to begin. The demon king arawn kills him and frees Rhiannon. Who has now falling in love with the demon king and has now made him the new leader of there clan. \nAnd so begins there adventure as they travel to a new land to call home while batting the empire. \nSo the plot and how it plays out is pretty much the generic template of fantasy rpg type story.\nIt is literally the demon king and his army of Ye olden day Scottish people and a few elfs vs the Roman army. Which not much else happening Which basically went on for most of the show.\nThat kind of got boring after a while and really made it tedious to watch.\nLike nothing of interest ever happened.\nIntill the end where it had this some what interesting idea of rebel against God or something along those lines in order the make the world a better place.\nWhich was an interesting concept enough but it came to little to late for me to actually care or it to have actual weight to the story.\nBut if you watch this show as a kind of coming of age story for the character Arthur as he learns how to become a good leader as he goes though the ups and downs which was quite of interesting to watch.\nBut other than that it's pretty bare bones.\n\nWhich is what really hurts it because you can see glimpses of good ideas here.\nbut they where never taken to there full extent of what they could have done with it.\n\nCharacters, 5/10\n\nThe main character arawn was kind of interesting.\nEspecially with his back story.\nBut other than that nothing really special about him.\nHe just this chill guy that's a good leader.\n\n\nThe side character are also generic as fuck.\nThere basically cardboard cut outs.\n\nLike one character is a serious type and another is the wise old man.\n\nWhich not much fleshing out or character development.\n\n\nArt, 5/10\n\nAnimation is average.\nEven back grounds where average.\n\nIt has has a generic style.\n\n\nThe character designs are generic fantasy designs.\n\n\nSound, 5/10\n\nThe op and ending songs are pretty average.\nNothing really stands out for me.\nThe ost was also very bland to me.\nBut it was on point for the scenes it was in so I give it credit for that.\n\n\nEnjoyment, 3/10\n\nNow I really like fantasy stories and I have been shown when done right they can be epic classics. But sadly there was nothing much to be that really that had my interest for to long in this show for me to actually enjoy.\nI really liked the idea of fighting against God which was interesting but that never went any where with it..\nOther than that I got bored really quickly and made me feel empty afterwards. \n\n\n\nOverall, 5/10\n\nNow if you have never had any experience with fantasy type story's in your life.\nThen this is probably a good place to start.\n\nBut if you have played lots of fantasy RPGs or watched or read any type of fantasy story then tears of tiara will make you shed tears of how boring and generic it is."}, {"id": 3011, "score": 51, "body": "Warning this review may contain spoilers.\n\nFirst impressions,\nSo we got this story of where a demon king has awoken and brave heros prepare to fight this evil but I'm the mean time they send him bitchs to fuck in the mean time.\nSounds like a hentai plot already or just a really generic harem.\n\n\nStory,5/10\n\nThe sky cracks, the ground shakes , trees wither , animals run in fear and a cold wind blows though the lands, \nThe Fabled eclipse has happened which means that the evil demon king exoda C claw has woken up from his slumber and the island of shina dark has risen from the deeps to be the demon king's home once again. \nWith no heroes around at the time to combat the demon king, \nThe nations of humanity decide to send over a thousand sacrificial maidens, \nin order to stop his wrath from consuming there nations and to provide an outlet for his lust which is seid to be as endless as the dark abyss he was spawn from.\n\nWhen the maidens land on the cursed land, they soon find that maybe the things they have been told about the demon king may have been false \nAs they find out that he doesn't intend to destroy the world nor does he want all these harem girls on his island, he would rather prefer to just chill or do mundane thing like fishing or gardening, which is very different from the picture that most people paint him as, it actually turns out that quite a lot of his actual legend keeps on getting changed a lot or new shit gets added in like the whole thing about his lust. \n\nSo after the demon king finds out about all these girls that have basically been forced to come to his island, seeing that he has caused a lot a suffering to all these girls who old lives where ripped away from them,\nhe decides to tell them all that they are free to leave as they wish and go back to there old lives if they choose, but sadly they don't have that option because when most of them try to do that, they basically become the trash of society because they have been on the demon king island and so they are forced to come back to shina dark because they have no where else to turn to.\nSo in order to remedy the situation he then decides to declare the island of shina dark a country so these girls can start new lives and pass the time intill an \"actual\" hero can defeat the demon king.\n\nSo the story is pretty much a very basic how to run a country,\nIt's very similar to tears to tiara or utawarerumono in that respect,\nBut unlike them shina dark doesn't have what made those titles work.\nBecause in those titles there was always problem that has to be dealt with when you run a country or it was building up some sort of end game.\nBut there is none of that here. \nIt's for the most part is doing mundane things.\nLike planting crops or starting a trade route with other countries, \nWhich was pretty interesting to see them try to establish the basics to make there country work and to see some of the small details.\nWhile every now a then random heroes show up to fight the demon king and get there ass kicked because for some reason this fantasy land doesn't under stand that the title of hero isn't something you give to people just because,\nit is something that is get though hard work and plus it's a title you can only get though Earning it, but it's kind of expected from the type of story this is, so I give it a pass on that little nick pic.\n\nThe only things of actual interest or tension that was was going on is where we find out that human kingdoms in this world are actually on the decline and slowly decaying. Because the people is power refuse to change there ways and they are basically putting themselves in a corner and also because quite a few people are moving to the new country of shina dark because it's pretty much the only country at the moment not run by idiots and they want a new life,\nWhich again was interesting to see but sadly they never go to deep with it, \nWhich I believe was a miss opportunity because they could of showing how it got to that state and how people became so despite that they would risk moving to the shina dark which is sied to be an evil place. \n\nThe other thing which kind of had something interesting to it was how one of the maiden's that's a princess has been slowly poisoned by her evil step mother because reasons.\nWhich could have been done interesting way like for example her trying to kill her so her children will be next in line for throne, but we get none of that because her whole reason for it was because she was related to poor. \nAnother thing is how we are also showed that some people where sent to shina dark just to get them out of the way so some people can make there lives even more shit or take what these people have for themselves. \nWhich was kind of one note but it was also interesting to see how this world is generated by false fear and how some people will use that to there own benefit.\n\nSo overall the story has glimpses of good ideas but they never go anywhere with them,\nBecause even though most of the ideas have kind of been done before and In some cases better.\nIt could have started off plan and then Slowly build up to something fine or good \nWhich it seems like it was hinting that it was going to do that.\nBut wasn't given enough time to do that, \nPlus it only has 20 chapters with no sequel in sight. \nWhich is probably the most disappointing thing about it.\n\n\n\n\nCharacters, 5/10\n\nThe main character exoda C claw is pretty much two dimensional at the most,\nHe has a very chill and relaxing personality which is some what different from what you would expect from the type of character he is or what people paint him out to be. \nbut it seems like and they actually hint or imply this, \nThat he wasn't always like the way he is now,\nBecause if he always like this then why would true heroes try to fight him and stop him if he was this chill dude.\nSo there is definitely some sort of back story here which we never told or given the opportunity to be told.\n\n\nThe side characters are all pretty one note,\n\nThere all likable for the most part,\nbut the problem is that you don't have enough time to know these characters and also the lack of prescence there sort of there.\nI am a person who good with names and can't for the life of me remember any of the characters.\n\n\nArt, 5/10\n\nThe artwork for the most part is fine,\n\nIt has a very moe like style which isn't that off putting.\n\nThe character designs are basically a mix of generic fantasy and moe.\n\n\n\nEnjoyment, 5/10\n\nWhen it comes to enjoyment I liked the ideas that shina dark was using and I wasn't p bored to tears while reading it and it was very relaxing to read so I enjoyed it with the bare minimum requirements,\nBut what really put a spanner in the works in terms of enjoyment is that it seems like I seid before that seems like it was going some where but wasn't given the chance to do so. \n\n\nOverall, 5/10\n\nNow if your new to manga and what not and want something very simple and quick to read then shina dark is worth checking out as an ok time passer and also to say that you have got another finished manga under your belt.\n\nBut if your well experienced In manga and story telling in general then probably don't read this unless your really bored."}, {"id": 3012, "score": 63, "body": "Story,\n\nIt is sied that in an ancient text held in a old Shinto shrine on the tallest mountain of japan.

after watching the first season of the anime,\nI got pretty hooked into Tokyo ghoul so I decided to check out the manga to see what happens next and what not and for the most part I wasn't disappointed,\nBut after reflecting on my experience with Tokyo ghoul I realized it had quite a few problems which needs to be talked about and addressed.\n\nStory, 6/10\n\n\" if you where to write a story about me, Then it would certainly be a tragedy\"\nAnd that is definitely what this story is about.\n\nThe story of Tokyo ghoul is pretty much about these humanoid beings known as ghoul's who kill and feed on humans there basically glorified vampires, who are hunting down by the CCG ( which are basically ghoul hunters) \nSo you see it's one of those humans Vs insert treat to humanity here type of story's similar to eflen lead, ajin and parasite.\nThe story begins with are Main character ken kaneki who is collage student waiting at a coffee shop for a girl named rize who he has interest in and it seems like she is also interested in him, \nso after getting the chance to go on a with date with rize, He soon finds himself into very deep shit when it's revealed that rize is a ghoul who has plans to make him tonights dinner, so after trying to escape he ends up in a building site where he ends up badly injured, but it seems like fate had another plans in Mind as a bunch of steel beams fall on rize almost by accident and kill her with kaneki on the verge of death,\nHe then wakes up in a hospital and finds out that in order to save his life the doctors transplanted some of rize organs into him.\nWhich has now transformed him into a human - ghoul hybrid, \nWith him now unable to eat human food and can only feed on human flesh,\n\nNow with his life thrown into the pits of despair and so begins the tragedy,\n(But in all honesty I think the real tragedy here is that he wasn't able to tap that sweet piece of ass)\n\nBut luckily he is found by a group of peaceful ghoul's known as Anteiku who decide to take kaneki in and teach him how to live life in his new half ghoul state.\n\nSo the first half of Tokyo ghoul is mainly focused on kaneki trying to find his footing in a world which is completely alien to him, so on his journey to trying to become useful \nFor his new ghoul ally's and find his place in the world now that he no longer human any more, We learn about the culture , politics , social aspects of the ghoul world,\nWhich was for the most part interesting to watch how ghouls operate in human society and how there society is very parallel to our world, it almost like its a shadow world that takes place with out us knowing about it.\nIt is also In this part of the story where we get into introduced to the Main concept of Tokyo ghoul which is the kind of gray morality conflict between humans and ghouls,\nIt basically trying to do this social political thing with ghouls, where there misunderstood and discriminated against and there not all evil monsters so on and so forth , with Kaneki trying to show to humans that ghouls aren't just all killing machines.\n\nSo around the halfway mark as kaneki is getting a good flow going what happens next, \nHe gets kidnapped and tortured by a ghoul organization known as aogiri tree and becomes ka-edgey as a result and has decided he is going go on his own for awhile in order to achieve his goals of protecting his friends and his place in the world,\nIt basically where he becomes an anti hero,\n(in edge we trust I guess)\n\nSo the second half of Tokyo ghoul is focused on kaneki quest for answers,\nLike who was rize, the disappearance of the Doctor who did his operation, and what is aogiri tree plans are. \nSo In this part it's mostly kaneki fighting people and being a badass about it while finding out vague information which won't be of any relevance intill Tokyo ghoul:re,\nIt basically telling you that there is some sort of conspiracy / mystery going on in the background, \nit basically one of those you kind of know the answer but you some more information to be more accurate.\n\nSo after Getting over his anti hero phase he decided to return to Anteiku,\nWhich is where We get to the unexpected ending \nWhich came out of nowhere, \nAnd it pretty much ended on then most pain In the ass cliff hanger and thank god there is a sequel manga because it leaves you with more questions than actual answers.\n\nNow I am pretty sure a lot of you are going to ask me this question,\nBiogundam why didn't you talk the mature themes of Tokyo ghoul and how it's a very mature and what not,\nWell good question because I am going to talk about that right now,\nI would like to state that Tokyo ghoul isn't a mature series or as mature has some people hype it up to be, and before you down vote me the hell let me explain,\na Mature series is all about subtlety and yes Tokyo ghoul dose have the theme's and concept's that could make it mature, \nBut when it comes to theme and concept exploration it is as about subtle as a brick to the face, because it mostly relies on over the top edge to try and get its point across,\nNow you can argue that the violence makes it try hard but in all honesty I think it trying way to hard when it shouldn't have to.\nI think what they could have done to fix this is add more slice of life moments or just add more chapters focused on that, because it really doesn't give you enough time to breath every time a death happened or something fucked up happens,\nThey could have done something similar like parasite where we had a lot of slice of life moments that fleshed out more of the concept and also when shit hit the fan it had more impact, because we had more cool down moments. \n\nSo while we're on this topic let me also address some other problems,\n\nFor one there seems to be quite a few gaping holes in logic,\nFor example when kaneki was in the hospital after his accident ,\nWhy wasn't there any police or some sort of health and safety organization that has questioned kaneki or having a investigation into what happened,\nBecause you would think that a event like that would have been invested,\nIt was big enough event to end up on the news.\nAnother example gaps in logic I would also like to talk about the holes in the ghoul hunters logic or CCG as they are called,\nIf ghoul anatomy and physiology are so different from humans then why is it that no one can tell the difference, you would think that they would come up with more precise and simple ways to find out if someone a ghoul or not, \nand those are just a few examples of the gaps of logic you will find here.\n\nAnother problem I had was that the pacing was Very slow and it made things drag out a bit longer an they actually had to.\n\nNow I know that I have been mostly negative though this review,\nWell it time for me to talk about what I think Tokyo ghoul dose quite well,\n\nIt has a very good sense of atmosphere, you can feel tension you can feel the emotions of the characters while there going through there events,\n\nIt also contains a lot of world building, that mostly involved the ghoul world and how things work and what not.\nAnother thing I would like to add is that it's narrative has good foreshadowing all the events that happen don't always feel random because Tokyo ghoul dose have this sense of grand scale planing,\nbut the problem which I was talking about before is that it forgets the small details it try's to establish.\n\n\nCharacters, 6/10\n\nThe main character of Tokyo ghoul kaneki ken was interesting for the most part,\nAt first glance I definitely thought he was a bitch though,\nHe was pretty much like your typical shounen protagonist,\nHe has no back bone doesn't know what the hell he is doing,\n\nBut then I had to take into account that In the first half that there was some decent development there so I give his character credit for that and also the fact we get a lot of internal monologue with him so we what exactly is going on in his mind,\n\nBut Instead of a gradual transformation to not being a Bitch and being more alpha,\nHe gets tortured and suddenly transform into this total badass\nWhich was cool to watch,\nBut in all honesty it kind of came out of nowhere,\nI mean development stops right there and the only thing we actually see is how psychology damaged he is,\nWhich was good fleshing for his character and also some foreshadowing to things that we won't be told intill later or the sequel \n\n\nThe side characters,\nMost of them where very uninteresting and pretty one note for the most,\nNow the main side characters for the most more interesting,\nThey all had an descent personality for most part,\nThe good parts about them are, \nYou could pretty much call ether two or three dimensional characters,\nQuite a few of them have good reason for doing what there doing,\nThey some off them also get some fleshing out,\nWe get know some back story about them and also get some decent inner monologue, \nthere also a lot of turmoil.\nNow the negative are,\nThat by the first 20 chapters we already have 20 + introduced to us \nAnd the it's feels very disjointed at times when the story try to make them all relavent and I know it's the manga way of trying to make this inter connectable Universe\nWhich is pretty good on paper,\nBut for the most part A Good majority of these characters don't actually have much of impact or importance to the plot intill much later on and some of them won't have any intill the sequel.\nAnother problem with the big cast of characters is for most I forgot who half these people are, I actually have to go to the wiki to see who half these people are,\nAnd it doesn't help that quite a lot of them don't have enough characterization in order to help differentiate them.\n\nI really like the character interactions and some of them where pretty interesting to see.\n\n\n\nArt, 6/10\n\nThe artwork at the start looks very cartoony but it starts getting better after the ch 30,\n\nAt times the artwork can be choppy at times Especially in fights scenes\nBecause some times you can't tell what the fuck is going on half the time and speaking of fight scenes the gore is pretty well done,\nBut my one complaint is that it seems like at times they tone down the blood a bit because there are parts where you would think there would be a lot of blood and by lots.\nThe back grounds are very basic.\n\nIt has a vary edgey and depressed looking style to it.\n\nThe character design where quite nice, \nBecause there is pretty decent variety there In Character Designs and also you can also tell most of the characters a part which is always a plus,\n\nBut I don't really like how some of them are so cartoony especially some of the antagonists \nLike there this one character who has bug eyes and looks like a walking corpse.\n\n\n\nEnjoyment, 7/10\n\nI really enjoyed this series and it was a pretty interesting ride over all,\nI was never bored while reading this and I was always on the edge on the my seat,\nWondering what you happen next and honestly I found the things it talked about very interesting and also how ghouls try fit in human society which was pretty cool and even though it's concept has been done before,\nI think it did an alright job with it.\n\n\n\n\nOverall, 6/10\n\nSo if you looking for a story that covers basic ideas of ethnics and morals and is full of edge and all that good shit then Tokyo ghoul is what your looking for.\n\nBut if you looking for something mature or something that doesn't use edge to get its point across then probably look some where else and if you like the concept of Tokyo ghoul them probably go watch/ read parasite."}, {"id": 3015, "score": 52, "body": "First impressions,\nSo when I first got into this show I got incredibly confused by the show itself,\nBut after sticking though it and watching it twice I got what this show about,\nAll though I am pretty sure that was because when I first got into the show I was still new to anime, But at the same time this is generally confusing at times.\n\n\nStory, 5/10\n\nSo we without wings is a story that about the adventures of are 3 main characters,\nWhich I am going to talk about them one at a time.\n\nThe first one being about Takashi haneda a bata male high school student who claims he a prince from another world and by another world I mean generic Japanese RPG fantasy world but stays in order to look after his little sister,\none day he is asked out by a girl named Asuka watarai who only reason to date him so far is in order to stop other guys from hitting on her,\nSo his story arc is manly focused on blacking out and \nGoing to fantasy land and being a bata male in the friend zone while at school.\nThis by far was probably one of the most boring story arcs I had ever had to sit through the entirety of this show and honestly it's only ether got interesting to me when the twist about him starts interfering with his life.\nWhich doesn't happen intill the ending episodes.\n\n\nThe second being about Shusuke chitose a happy go lucky Youthful Young man who visits a bar named Alexander and is also a freelance journalist and book reviewer, who one day meets a girl by the name of hiyoko tamaizumi an up and coming novelist which are main character confuses to be a porn star,\nWho starts working at the bar Alexdander in order to help with her income.\nSeeing that he made a mistake he decides to also work at Alexdander in order to change her opinion about him.\nThis arc is manly focused on him luring the ropes of working at a bar and trying to get this girl to change her opinion on him,\nWhich dose led to some funny things,\nSo this arc was a bit more entertaining to me and it wasn't that boring,\nBut it's still nothing special.\n\nAnd my favorite out of the story arcs dum roll please................................\nHayato narita a steet smart loner who works odd jobs and every now again gets involved in gang fights, one day while looking for a job he comes across a girl named naru ohtori a local school girl and the little sister of a local gang leader,\nWho comes to him in order to help her find her missing bike.\nThis arc is manly focused on what happens to the city around night time With the gangs and night life in full swing,\nWhich is probably more interesting and entertaining for me at least to see gangs fighting each other and the overall atmosphere of the night life,\nWhile some school girl try's to get into the main character pants.\nSo this arc nothing really that special but probably for me the best story arc to watch.\n\nNow it's time to get to that twist I mentioned,\nNow you're probably thinking by the sounds of this story it's pretty much about these 3 guys who only relation is that they all live in the same city,\nWell what If I told you that all the main characters are actually the same person,\nWell actually different people that share the same body,\nSo this is actually about a day to days life of a person with the spilt personally disorder with each personally taking over the body at different times,\nWith Takashi in control in school time , Shusuke in the afternoons and Hayato at night, who are basically there to protect the true \nPersonally yoji haneda.\n\n\nI am here watching this and thinking to myself that this is actually a pretty interesting idea I wonder where there going to go with it,\nThis could make some very interesting drama if they handle it right\nAnd what do with it Nothing much,\nBecause for the most part the story pretty much focused on comedy which made me laugh at times, \nBut they only uses the spilt personally thing in order to make this show a little different from the crowd it's basically becomes nothing beyond a gimmick \n\nThe only time they actually used it for drama was at the end and a few other scenes which pretty Much frizzed out and didn't even matter in the grand scheme of things especially when you're trying to have a dramatic moment that had not built up or had the tone to support such a scene,\nBut I still liked the ending even though it was kind of rushed.\n\nSo we with without wings had good premise and interesting narrative set up \nBut sadly all of this was good on paper and it didn't use all those ingredients to its full potential.\n\n\nCharacters, 5/10\n\nThe first main character Takashi was pretty much a basic bata male,\nWho isn't that interesting at all,\nI do like him a bit more at the end when he came to turns with his problem \nBut it came to little to late for me to care.\n\nThe second main character Shusuke was very enjoyable for me to watch,\nHis happy go lucky personally helped make this show a lot less boring than it should have been,\n\nTh third main character Hayato was probably my favorite out of the three,\nI really like his loner take no shit personally he was also fun to watch as well.\n\nAnother thing before I move on I really want to talk the relationship that the three personality have with each other,\nThat there all there to protect and care for each other even if it results in one of them disappearing for ever,\nIt kind of this brotherly love kind of relationship.\n\nThe supporting cast was ok for the most part,\nSome of them where quite fun to watch,\nBut there not the deepest or the most likable characters I have seen, \nMost of them are just bland character archetypes,\nWhich wasn't that bad because quite a few of them didn't feel like archetypes.\nBut there just kind of there just to fill space a guess.\n\nArt, 6/10\n\nThe animation was quite decent,\nNothing mind blowing but looks alright.\n\nIt's has the nice visual novel style to it.\n\nI quite like some of the character designs.\n\nSound, 5/10\n\nI actually quite liked the op song,\nI found it nice to listen to,\nNothing great but honestly.\nThe ending song was kind of mah to me.\n\nThe ost was alright to listen to,\nIt was on point for when it was used,\nBut sadly it's very forgettable at lest for me.\n\n\nEnjoyment, 6/10\n\nI quite enjoyed this anime dissipate it problems,\nBecause a really did enjoy the comedy and the over all atmosphere and I found this a decent time passer.\nBut what really hampered my enjoyment is that this could have been if it had focus a lot more on the spilt personally thing.\n\nOverall, 5/10\n\nSo if you like V.n anime or basic rom-com drama then probably check this one out,\nYou may not get the feels but you have an ok time passer,\nIf you don't like this type of show then probably stay away,\nBecause even though it's ok by the standards of what it is.\nIt is still a mah show as a whole.\n"}, {"id": 3020, "score": 62, "body": "Warning this review may contain spoilers.\n\nFirst impressions, so after watching the less than subpar anime version of this\nI became increasingly interested in what happens next and all that jazz.\n\n\nStory, 7/10\n\nHeaven is a place that many try to reach But sadly fail,\nSome try to get in though good deeds,\nOthers try to get in though there righteousness.\nThen happens if this heaven is actually just another hell with a different cote of paint on it.\nAre story starts with the powerful angel alexiel an angel who loved God and protected heaven from all those who would attack it.\nBut as timed passed she became to be disgusted with the behavior of the Angels around her,\nShe decided to start a rebellion against God Which sadly failed.\nFor her punishment her spirit was sent to earth to live as a human and experience a cycle of tragic lives that will never end.\nWe Come to her latest reincarnation are main character Setsuna Mudo a hot blooded troubled teen who is in love with is sister sara.\nWhile setsuna is trying to live his life.\ndark forces close In an order to awaken alexiel and start the rebellion anew.\n\nNow just before I start I would like to add that I am probably going to generalize a lot so please ber with me.\n\nThe first half is basically setsuna is starting to awaken to his destiny and him also coming to turn that he actually in love with his sister.\nWhile is every day life is starting to fall more apart.\nIt Also him starting to take responsibility for his actions \nAnd what he has done. \nWhile he goes to the under world to try and save his sister soul.\nWhile meeting some old friends and Gaining the skills he needs to be a true hero.\n\nThe second half is basically more about the Angel and demon worlds and in How both of them work.\nAnd how the Angel world has gone very bad and \nAnd setsuna embraces this destiny in order to save the world and his sister,\nWhich is basically him a bunch of demons and Angels fighting God.\n\nSo the story basically boils down to his that God is a evil prick that needs to be stopped.\nNow even though it dose basically boil down it.\nIt is actually interesting because,\nBecause heaven and hell aren't as black and white as they seem.\n\nBecause most of the Angels have become quite brutal in how they do things and In some cases have come nothing more than monsters that live to kill even being more savage than the demons they actually fight.\nAlso heaven for some angels is actually more hellish than hell itself.\nfor quite a few of the Angels more like a golden cage than anything else because there not aloud to experience any kind of earthy desires and if you brake one of there rules and you basically get killed on the spot.\n\nThe demon even though are just as savage at times,\nAt lest they don't say what there doing is the righteous thing,\nEvery thing that basically do is more along the lines of saying fuck you to God or doing it some propose of theres.\nI think that's a lot more interesting than just clear cut Angels good demons bad.\n\nAnother thing which I think is good about it,\nIs that it covers a lot of themes for example,\nmorality, destiny and social conformity.\n\nBut I guess my negatives are that.\n\nEven though it has quite a lot going on in it,\nLike when the story kicks of there is quite a few point points that come up around the same time.\nWhich really isn't a really a bad thing because at lest it trying to spice it up a bit.\nBut at times the story did get hard to follow at times because there was quite a bit going, like a times I found it very confusing at times and I think at times it bit of more it can chew.\n\nI guess another problem I seem to have is that at times it pacing is a little off and I feel at times it should have gone faster or slower and it didn't need as many chapter as it did.\nBecause there some part which I think is a bit to dead time for its own good.\n\n\n\nCharacters, 6/10\n\nThe main character setsuna starts of as this very hot blooded teenage boy who also very reckless and always gets into all sorts of problems.\nBut as time goes by and he starts to take responsibility for his actions and trying his best to make up for some of the things he done.\nHe also has a lot of turmoil because of his love for his sister and some of the choices he had to make.\n\nThe side characters are alright for the most.\n\nQuite a few are actually interesting and have depth to them .\n\nBut at the same time most of them are kind of average and also the fact that there is a lot of them which makes it kind of hard to work with,\nEspecially if your trying to flesh them out or develop them.\n\nAlso there is some really weird character interactions in this,\nBecause of the fact that some characters are probably where some one else in another life and also the fact that some of these characters have feeling for seid characters.\n\n\n\nArt, 6/10\n\nThe art for the most part is fine,\nBecause there are parts that look very nice.\nBut at the same time most of it looks pretty average at best.\n\nIt has this very shojo mixed with edge like style to it,\nWhich kind of looks weird to look at.\n\nThe character design are basic shojo shit,\nBut one thing which is very odd is that most of the characters look like men even some of the female characters look like men.\nLike if Q character didn't say the are a girl I probably would have thought they where a dude.\nIt at times to hard to tell which character is which exactly.\nBecause look exactly the same.\n\n\nEnjoyment, 6/10\n\nI really enjoyed the ride of this manga.\nI also really like some of the ideas it used.\nWhich made it more interesting.\n\n\nOverall, 6/10\n\nNow if your looking for something that is probably different from what the norm is then probably check this out.\nBut my would probably recommend to approach it with as a open mind as possible because there is some shit In this story that kind of fucked up and is a very hard pill to swallow.\n\nIf your very religious person then probably stay away from this."}, {"id": 3021, "score": 62, "body": "Warning this review may contain spoilers.\n\nFirst impression, I never thought it would be possible that there was a show that I actually was looking forward to 100%.\nAnd it actually gave me exactly what I wanted.\n\n\nStory,6/10\n\nOver 100 years ago,\na sport was played With skill and honer, so many have played \nOnly the mightiest of Warriors have played this sport.\nThey risked there very lives and dreams in order to be the best,\nThe fallen would be Crushed and forgotten,\nBut the winners would have there names and deeds sung though the very halls of VALHALLA itself.\nBut where not talking about that sport,\nWe are talking about a sport that is way more important.\nThe sport named kejio where girls fight in a pool only using them tites and ass as weapons of battle.\nBasically a mix between dead or alive extreme and water polo.\n\nJoin Nozomi Kaminashi a very talented gymnast who plans to fight her way to the top in order to get her family out of poverty,\nWhile making new friends and meeting new rivals on her path to becoming a kejio master.\n\nSo as a lot of you can guess this is probably one of the most ridiculous premises for a story I have ever heard of to date,\nAnd despite all that it actually decent for a story which I have to turn off my Brain for in order to watch it,\nNow I am also not saying that's its savor of anime or it's the cancer of anime like a lot of people are saying it is, \nAlthough I feel that those take those stances are kind of loosening the point of it.\nBut if I am being completely honest the only thing this saved me from was my complete boredom because watching this anime season was draining.\n\n\nBut the story for all intents and purposes kejio is of its self is just one giant meme a joke.\nWhich doesn't require much thought than the usual, \noh look there dong something over the top with boobs and ass again.\nAnd there some sort of plot that keeps it going.\n\nNow One can argue that it exploiting woman and all that other p.c culture crap.\nOf course I feel that a very little nit pick.\nBut I would like add a counter point,\nThat sex sells and that not going to change anytime soon,\nUnless all the sex drives just disappear all out of no where.\n\nPlus I would like to add that this show isn't always about fan service.\nit also about following your dreams and ambitions,\nWhile having fun on the way,\nAnd honestly that makes it more interesting and actually relatable.\n\nAll though I was more watching it for the pure abserdy of it all.\nI mean how can I not treat it was such.\nIt's a story based around a spot with girls slamming there asses into each over. \n\nNow I have been mostly positive.\n\nIt's time for the negatives.\nNow even I do find it extremely funny,\nI feel at times that it looses stream at times and the joke starts to become less funny as it goes along.\n\nI would also like to add that the pacing is quite off at times,\nLike there some parts like In the first few episodes which kind of went a bit to fast and there where other time where the pacing slows down because there trying to make up for a fast pace,\nIt really find it hard to keep to a steady pace.\nI also think that could toned down on the talking and info dumps,\nthe first episode we where explained the basics and how the game was played,\nBut than later on in the same episode they repeat the exact same thing.\nWhich is bother some when I came here to see crazy over the top bull shit.\n\nThat other that that there really nothing much else to say.\n\n\nCharacters 6/10 \n\nThe main character Nozomi.\nI would probably say she a very fun led to follow.\nWith her very I wouldn't say interesting,\nBut very energetic personally that kind of grows on you over time.\nAnd also very determined to follow her dreams which makes her quite relatable to any one who trying to follow your dreams. \n\n\nThe side characters.\nAre very fun and kinda over the top.\nAnd actually have some sort of personality.\nWhich is always a plus.\nThere not the most interesting cast,\nBut are very fun to follow and that's how they should be. \n\nBut there really much else to them than that.\n\n\n\n\nArt,7/10\n\nThe animation looks very polished and dynamic.\nIt also has very nice flash to it.\n\nIt had some really great boob and ass shots.\n\nIt has a very over the top style \nWhich adds to the fight scenes to any run of the mail activity.\nWhich it makes over the top.\n\nThe characters design are quite nice,\n\nSound, 6/10\n\nThe op and ending I actually quite like which actually shocking because I general very fussy when it comes to sougs I like.\n\nOther than the kick ass op and nice ending the rest of the ost is pretty forgettable.\nThe ost was done by matsuo hayato who has done the ost for drifters and cyborg 009.\n\nThe dub and sub are both fine.\n\n\nEnjoyment,6/10\n\nI feel what really made me enjoy this anime.\nWas the fact that is show is so unapologetic about how sexual and over the top is about every thing,\nThis show doesn't give a fuck and I found that aspect of it very endearing.\nAnd also the fact that is show feels like it was made to have fun.\n\n\n\n\nOverall, 6/10 \n\nIf your looking for something insane and over the top then kejio is definitely what your looking for.\n\nIf you are a SJW or someone that doesn't understand that this is just for fun.\nOr don't like fan service or any of the elk then probably don't watch this \n"}, {"id": 3022, "score": 62, "body": "Warring this review may contain spoilers.\n\n\nFirst impressions, when looking back as my years as a child.\nI realize that I had actually all ready watching anime.\nOf course at the time I didn't realize that I was watching anime.\nAnd this show was one of them.\nAfter getting into anime officially I decided to take a trip down memory lane and finish a show from my childhood.\n\nStory,5/10\n\nAre story begans with sakura kimomoto a 10 year old girl who is just liveing for life to the fullest.\nBut one day while cleaning her father study. \nShe comes across a mysterious book which she opens,\nWhich contains a set of magic cards called the clow \nWhile trying to figure out what they are she accidentally spreads them across the world which a magic wind.\nAwakening the garden kero who tasks Sakura to get the clow cards back before they cause chaos and the worse case scenario the end of the world.\n\nNow to be honest here my experience with the magical girl genre is kind of limited at best because I Only seen 3 show so far this included.\nBut aside that.\nThe Main plot is pretty basic and bare bones.\nIt's essentially Card of the week adventures.\nwith sakura and co finding the cards and stoping them from causing to much chaos as possible,\nWhile sakura is dressing up In different outfits.\n\n\nWhich is perfectly fine if your a child or a young adult and you just want to watch this as Saturday morning cartoon fluff.\n\nBecause it pretty straight forward In plot and story telling.\nBecause you pretty much guess what going on or what's going to happen.\nLike for example sakura older brother who she kind of doesn't get along with all the time, \nWho Just happens to have a part time jobs near the area of where Sakura and a clow card are in the near by area.\n\n\nOf course I am not saying that it's so simple that even an adult can't like this show,\nBecause even though it is very painfully simple and pretty predictable\nthere is quite a bit of adult context to it.\n\nEspecially when you get into the whole back ground plot that also going On. \nLike for example in one episode we find out that this girl in sakura class who has a crush on a teacher who actually also share those feelings as well.\nAlong with a bunch of other weird things the throw In as well,\nwhich you will probably pick up on very quickly.\n\nOf corse this being the kind of story it is.\nIt takes these kind of mature situations at face value and kind of cherry picks them to make these situations more innocent than they actually seem.\nWhich kind of makes the show a bit more interesting. \nThan just your run of the mill kids show \nAnd it's quite nice for the story to try and maintain its child like innocence while giving slight winks to adult viewers.\nWhich should be given credit.\n\nBut there are quite a few issues I did have with the story. \n\nEven though it has this over arcing plot going down with a bunch of other things in the back ground and even makes you feel it's going to build up to something good.\nBut The actual conclusions are pretty week over all and doesn't really manage to build up itself well. \nAlthough at this point I was watching it more for the kinky romances and the actual core story.\nBecause it actually had progression and I was kind of getting bored with the whole card thing.\nIt also didn't help that most of the time the where repeating the same thing.\nOver and over again in till it loses most of its punch.\nI thought there would be a bit more variety is what I am trying to say.\n\n\nCharacters,6/10\n\nSakura I thought she was a fine character.\nBecause she actually acted like a kid her actual age.\nShe was very hopeful and innocent and always wanted to help people.\nOf corse she not best main character.\nBut for what she is in she fine.\n\nThe side characters where all fine.\nThere really isn't that much special or note worthy \nEspecially when compared to other casts I have seen.\nThey all have ok personality and I can actually tell the characters apart.\nAlthough the characters are pretty basic.\n\nThe only thing that actually note worthy is pretty much how none of them gives a fuck about sexuality and if they feel something for someone they go for it no question asked.\nWhich I think is actually interesting and a very mature take on that.\nBecause they don't actually don't draw much attention to it and they just let it play out as is.\nAlso because of this fact the character interactions can get a little weird at times.\n\nI wasn't bothered by it.\nBut it can get kind of get a little to touchy at times.\nLike you have this one scene with this one women who loved the main character dead mother and kind of hates the main character father for giving her the best years of her life before she died.\nAnd I thought that was pretty intense and something you don't she very often.\n\nArt,6/10\n\nThe animation looks quite nice actually even though it quite dated by today standards,\nBut I think that also a plus because it doesn't look to bright and shiny like you get quite a few magical girl shows,\nBecause To be honest some of those shows animation can get a bit to bright for my liking.\nIt has this nice cute look to it,\nWhich isn't to much in your face and doesn't over step it's welcome,\nIt just presented as is and I like that more than something trying to be overly cute,\nBecause I can only handle so much kawaii at a time before my power core burns out from to much kawaii.\n\nI like the character designs,\n\nBecause I quite like this kind of old school shoujo designs.\n\nSound, 5/10\n\nI liked the first op because it was energetic and quite relaxing,\nBut the rest didn't really stand out to me.\nLike it not bad because it fits very well with the show,\nBut it doesn't really click with me.\n\nThe ost was fine nothing really did stick out,\n\nIt was done by Takayuki Negishi ,\n\nWho also worked on Tokyo mew mew, Tokyo maijin, card fight vanguard.\n\nI liked both the dub and the sub,\nBecause there ok.\n\n\nEnjoyment, 5/10\n\nI actually enjoyed this show more than I thought I would.\nBecause it was relaxing and very light hearted which was kind of something I haven't watched in a while,\nSo I enjoyed the change of pace.\n\nI also enjoyed that it. Handled it's self in a mature way.\n\n\nOverall, 6/10\n\nNow if your looking for a show that you can kick back and relax with the kids then probably check this show out, because it pretty much a standard magical girl show,\nBut with more of an adult context to it.\n\nIf you don't like clamp and shoujo type shows then probably stay clear."}, {"id": 3023, "score": 66, "body": "Warning this review may contain spoilers.\n\nFirst impressions, in my life time I have gone through many challenges and trials,\nEach more difficult than the last.\nBut none could prepare me for this mighty challenge that took all my shounen nakama willpower to face, \nAnd that is watch gintama a shounen I think is over hyped as fuck.\nQuick side note I going to talk about the series as a whole so It includes all ginmata 2014 and 2017 shit because I am pretty sure seen enough to see where it going.\n\n\nStory, 6/10\n\nIn a world where 19th century Japan was \"visited\" by aliens and technology has jumped light years ahead of it time as a result.\nJoin Gintoki Sakata a former rouge samurai war veteran who dose odd jobs in order that pay the rent on time which doesn't happen very often.\n\nIf I where describe the story Of gintama as a whole, \nI would probably conpare it to a calm in the storm.\nWhat I mean of this you ask?\n\nBy calm I mean that 85% of the actual story are mostly focused on episodic comedy that manly relines on shounen manga and Japanese culture references for its jokes.\nWhich for the most part I didn't find very funny.\nLike there few episodes that made to laugh, \nFor example the one with the turtle assassin and that ep where the one of the cop characters is looking for a place to smoke and my personal favorite so far was the one with the pen friend with the nerdy guy and the nerdy chick.\nI thought those episodes where pretty funny,\nbut other than those examples I was bored to tears and nearly wanting to punch my computer screen to try and end my boredom and suffering.\n\nThe storm Which i was referring to earlier is what the other 15% of the story is focused on.\nWhich in my opinion made this show more likable for me personality.\nIs the parts where there very serious and shit is going down.\nWhich honestly blew me away.\nFirst for shounen standards these serious arcs are amazing like this took be back to my younger years when I used to watch Action movies a lot with hype and excitement.\nI mean this pretty much had the cream of the crop,\nIt had An interesting setting which breeds so much potential, it has the back story's and character relations which helps to care when shit hits the fan, badass fights which mixes samurai with aliens and massive space battle ships, it has the tension and the drama.\n\nSo what could possibly go wrong.\n\nWell there is the thing where it basically pisses away most of it story telling potential on episodic bull shit,\nAnd for those asking yes I understand that all series not matter how serious it gets dose need a few cool moments every now and then especially in action shounen like this.\nBut in all honesty it also what's really holding it back,\nLike when It actually has a story and it being serious and what not.\nit actually very good.\nFor example the Shinsengumi Crisis arc or the Yoshiwara in Flames arc,\nThose arc showed me that when gintama really wants to it can tell a good story.\n\nIf I am being Completely honest That is what makes me feel bad for the story in general because it's not reaching its full potential,\nIt has all these ingredients and doesn't even use half of them to its full effect.\nIt's a battle shounen when you strip it to its most basic components and it never wants to fully commit to that or build itself up like say for example yu yu hakasho. \n\nSo in conclusion I think mostly the story is mostly bullshit with a few good arcs that more than makes up for the shit you have to sit through.\n\n\nCharacters, 6/10\n\nThe main character Gintoki I think is quite cool-ish, I mean at lest he not another teenager protagonist.\nI would describe his personality like the story the calm before the storm,\nGenerally he very selfish, prevcnted and pretty chill about everything.\nBut when shits hits the fan you see more of his more intense nature.\nI like his back story, \nI think it's quite interesting and probably one of the few highlights of this show.\n\nSide characters,\nThey all have a sense of personality and they all there gimmicks.\nSome of them develop but its mostly the core cast.\n\nBut The rest are kind of throw away most of them just stays to there gimmicks,\nLike a fly on dog shit So all freshness dies pretty quickly.\n\nAlso most of the time I forgot most of characters that actually existed.\nI had continue to reminding myself who these people are and what they do, \nBut that could be because of the big cast of characters and also the fact that most of these characters I don't give a fuck about.\nI think the character interactions where quite fun to watch.\nIt almost like watching a big family interacting or some sort of gang with very close bonds to each over.\nSo that quite nice because it give you a reason to care.\n\n\n\n\nArt, 6/10\n\nThe animtion is fine, \nit gets more detailed and shiney as the shows goes along.\nThe fight scenes are quite nice there some very good sword battles.\n\nIt has a usual style for most shounen, \nLike for example naruto and dragon ball Z.\nIt has that feel and look similar to those shows.\n\nThe character design look interesting enough,\nI really like the robot chick design because it reminds me of chobitts.\n\nSome of the alien design could be better though,\nLike with some of these designs I thinking to myself that the person who made this was smoking some high quality shit.\nFor example there this one race that looks exactly like Humans but the where duck costumes and eat old Nintendo games with rice.\n\n\nSound, 6/10\n\nSense this is a old running shounen it has a lot of op and ending,\nWhich for the most part I thought where ok.\nNothing much really stands out for me much, except for op 5, 10 , 12 which I quite liked.\n\nThe ost was fine as well.\nBut nothing really got my interest.\nThere is something here that are worth a quick listen.\n\nOst was done by some random company which I didn't know about intill writing this review.\n\n\n\nEnjoyment, 5/10\n\nWhen it comes to enjoyment, this was a very mixed bag for me.\nBecause for the first 100 ep I was pretty much forcing myself to watch it,\nLike I was just so bored.\nThere where a few episodes which keeped me entertained like the examples I mentioned earlier. \nBut when it's actually serious it's very good and I am very much entertained and even falling for some of the show charm.\nSo I hate it lest than I thought I would.\n\nOverall, 6/10\n\nI would like to state that This show is way to over hyped. \nif your in your shounen phase then I guess I can recommend this to you,\nBut just word to the wise it not as good as the hype makes it out to be.\n\nIf your out of your shounen phase then probably stay away unless you want to try watch a shounen again to change it up.\nso my advice watch the first 30 ep and if you don't like it then probably leave it alone."}, {"id": 3025, "score": 65, "body": "Warning this review may contain spoilers.

But in reality it actually has a high chance of getting you very sick and can kill you.\nSo basically want happens to him is that he fucked up in a car accident and he gets kidnapped and gets pumped full of this drug along with the other people trying to push this shit.\nAnd it makes his condition worse and he eventually dies from it.\n\nSo it kinda gives you the feeling that your watching a 80s heist movie.\nLike there's a big sence of tension and a lot of oh what's going to happen next,\nIs he going to complete what he set out to do or will the opposition come out on top for this one.\nOther Than that you really isn't much to it in the main story wise.\nI could argue that it kind of a political commentary in a sense of how corruption can really fuck up any system and it sometimes take despite action in order for actual change to take place and people who want actual positive change have to go though all these God dam loops in order to get the smallest things done because of how knee deep the corruption really is.\n\nI also like how they went into the reason of why and how akumetsu was made so kind of the back ground plot. \nEven though I think it kind of bull shit.\nLike what happens is that this one dude has died which the main character knows,\nHe finds out that he a clone out of meany clones that where made from the DNA of a crime lord who wanted to basically be immortal.\nSo thought debate and discussion all the main character clones decide to continue with this cloning project with the sole intention of using it to save Japan.\nWhich dose help explain why they are able to pull off some of the crazy shit they do,\nBut for all intents and purposes I feel it to bloody convenient for me to actually care about it.\nBecause let's say for example I have 200 clones of me living in nz,\nWhich I remind you is a very small country it's quite similar to Japan in size.\nThe chances of me ever meating one of these clones has pretty low odds of ever happening.\nSo the fact that he met one of these clones and later on all of them is kind of bull shit to me.\nYes I understand that this is kind of nit picking but I just wanted to get that out of,the way.\n\nBut now it time to move on to the actual criticism.\nIt's so batshit insane that you really can't take it seriously,\nBecause in all honesty this is shlock if I have ever seen it.\nBut you know what it high grade shlock and it honest which is better I guess.\n\n\n\n\nCharacters, 6/10\n\nThe main character I like it kind of relaxed personality and he kind of a badass in a sense,\nBecause he so unassuming as a person and then he turns around and dose all this crazy shit.\nWhich is great because it nice to see that contrasts to his normal life and to the terrorist persona that he maintains.\nBecause like one minute he all chill and then the next minute he cracking skulls and kicking ass.\nOne problem I did have with him is that he is a pretty much a group at clones at this point so he very doesn't have a sense of identity.\nBecause he quote on quote dies so much that you really can't care about what happens to him because he still alive as long as there are still clones around.\nAlso talking about the cloning thing that rises big question as what happens when the clones die, do they get transferred to a new body right as rain or do they actually die and only there memories are just transferred.\nSo basically the main character is a hive mind at this point.\nWhich leaves me with more questions than answers.\nBecause I don't think they addressed the fact that he has no sense of self anymore because he a human hive mind and all that shit.\n\n\nSide characters,\n\nAre ok,\nThey all do there parts well.\nBut at the end of the day there just the usual characters you see in any setting with a high school included.\n\nBut a special mention to the politicians,\nThey are probably one of the most one dimensional villeins I have ever seen in my life \nLike God dam there no reason to relate or no reason given why they went down this path. \nThere just there to be hated which is great for me, \nbecause when they all get killed I am just laughing my ass off and it \nGave me great glee when they thought they where going to stop akumetsu or had thought they where going to live.\nBut then fail so hard and all that hope just goes away and is replaced with pure fear.\nSo great.\n\n\n\nArt, 6/10\n\nThe artwork is kind of patchy and all over the place,\nThey use a lot of dark lines.\nThe death scenes are actually quite well done and detailed enough to get the picture.\n\nIt was this very gritty style to it and it goes very well with the over the top tone. That the series has a whole.\n\nThe character designs are ok,\nNothing really special here.\nExcept I really like the main character terrorist persona look,\nIt reminds me of zero from code geass except if it was a bit more edger.\n\n\nEnjoyment, 7/10 \n\nI really found this really entertaining,\nBecause it's over the top, it bloody as all hell.\nAnd It has this atmosphere which I really like.\nI also liked the over the top death scene,\nThere just chaos and destruction every where.\nLike rooms full of dead people all over the place,\nPlaces on fire.\n\n\nOverall, 6/10\nIf you're looking for something over the top and gory then check out akumetsu then.\nIf you want something more serious and down to earth then probably look else where."}, {"id": 3027, "score": 66, "body": "Warning this review may contain spoilers \n\nFirst impressions,\nSo when I was browsing some sites I came across this hentai anime which looked nice to me and plus it was about 80min long and also in HD,\nSo I thought might of well checked it out.\n\nStory, 6/10 \n\nIn a normal Japanese house an epic sibling love triangle as been brought to sirvice.\nMain character yuuta a shy shorta with a little bit of a sister complex.\nHas now been put in a rock in a hard place as both of his older sisters are both in love with him, the very mothery chiyoko and the tomboy chinatsu who will try everything to get the object of there love one way or the other.\nSo what is are main character going to do with him all alone in this house with no adult supervision that could help contain this rush of teenage hormones.\n\nSo this being a hentai he gets into a relationship with the oldest of the two sisters chiyoko.\nWhich makes the youngest of the sisters chinatsu very jealous And she basically gets his dick. \nSo basically for a while he fucking both of them and the older sisters finds out.\nBut instead of being upset she decides to share him with her and they live happily ever after with threesome after threesomes.\n\nSo this is quite a basic vanilla plot,\nBut even though it is that It actually quite decent for it.\nLike nothing ever feels forced or somethings sexy just happens because they needed it in there act the moment.\nBut more along the lines of what the characters are feeling at the time.\nSo the plot pretty much runs on the feels like there no tomorrow.\nWhich I found quite nice and relaxing.\n\nAnd far has content goes it has all the basics, \nBut with yuri and some threesomes thrown in there just because.\nSo enjoy.\n\n\n\nCharacters, 5/10\n\nMain character yuuta kind of this shy shota boy who kind got a thing for his sisters.\nAnd other than that there nothing much about him.\nExcept that he seems to have God levels worth of stamina.\nI guess playing all those sports helped in some way.\n\nThe older sisters chiyoko and chinatsu where both fine.\nThat have ok personalities and they seems to be fine with sharing there younger brother between them because that want to stay together as a family.\n\n\nArt, 7/10 \nAnimation is to put it into better words amazing,\nThe Animation looks very sharp and crisp and also very organic in movements.\nThis is pretty much something you should watch in HD.\nAlso the fact that this is a hentai which looks great, because normally most hentai have a lower budget than usual main stream anime.\nSo who did the this must of really cared and put a lot of effort into it.\nBut on the bad side the Back grounds little bad compared to the rest of the show.\nBut who actually cares.\n\nIt has the style of a usual light novel.\nBut not overly sexualized.\n\nI really like the character designs,\nEspecially for the Older sisters characters.\nBecause they actually look quite nice.\n\n\n\nSound, 5/10\n\nThere is actually an op for this.\nBut sadly I didn't really like it and I kind found it bland.\n\nThis show only has one other piece of music for its ost.\nThat was used very well in the last scene of the show .\nWhich was quite nice to listen.\n\n\n7/10, enjoyment.\n\nI would be lying if I seid I didn't enjoy this show.\nBecause not only is it an ok flap,\nBut it also covers a few of my fetishs to a slight degree.\nI also really enjoyed the fact that this has some very nice animation and it's just seems like the people behind this really did care about the project.\nSo it cool to see a hentai done with love and care.\nI found it somewhat up beat nature very relaxing.\nAlso a hentai which I go back to and watch a again every now and then is very deserving of my high score for enjoyment.\n\n\n\nOverall, 6/10 \n\nIf you're looking for a decent vanilla hentai series then check this out.\nBecause if you like the feels you will get some of it here.\n\nIf you not into incest, yuri,threesomes or are into more hard core shit then probably go somewhere else. "}, {"id": 3029, "score": 63, "body": "Warning this review my contain spoilers \n\n\nFirst impressions, so my first thoughts going into this was that this was was going to be a more complete story than the anime which stopped 3/4 in and so i read this to get the full package because I thought this worth the price of entry and to some extent it was because it a bit different from your usual harem.\n\nStory, 6/10\n\nNow I know that this is going to sound quite generic but please beer with me as I explain this isn't a problem.\nSo the story begins with are main character keima who kind of a outcast that doesn't really care for much besides playing dating sim games.\nWhich In fact he's pretty good at you could call him a grand master of dating sim games,\nSo much so that he called the God of conquest.\nOne day he get a mysterious email which request him to conquer girls \nThinking this is for a game challenge he agrees.\nIn repose he meets a air headed demon named elise who tells him that he has signed a contract with her to find and capture lost souls which love are evil spirits which hide in the hearts of girls, that can only be removed by love.\nHe first refuses to help because he has no interest or experience with real women,\nBut than finds out that if he doesn't he and Elise will be killed on the spot.\nSo now he is forced to use his dating sim skills and knowledge to surprising effect in order to have these girls fall in love with him and get the lost souls.\n\nSo as far as harem story's go I thought this was probably one of the more interesting ones I have read.\nNow I not saying it revolutionary or anything like that,\nLike quite a few people are saying it is.\nBecause it plays out pretty much like most harems,\nExcept for the fact that the main character doesn't give a fuck about these girls and there problems. \nKind of plays out like a video game when I think about it.\n\nthe first half of the story can be summarized as girl of the week.\nWith the Main character using his skills to Solve these problems.\nWhich was for the most part the usual teenage problems,\nLike my family I don't get along or I have daddy issues or I am very shy.\nThat kind of crap Nothing really that deep or thought provoking.\nExcept for a few exceptions here in there,\nWhen they where fixing problems that wasn't related to high school students .\nBut how they handled I thought was kinda interesting and should get credit for trying to be at least somewhat interesting.\nAlthough it still held back by that it's most set in a high school so your opinions are going to be very limited.\n\nThe second half is where it actually starts getting a plot and becomes more serious and focused.\nBecause when he helps a girl they forgot all about him,\nSo he can continue playing video games and fixing more girls problems without much of a hitch.\nBut now there are actually some girls that do remember him because they contain goddess in them.\nWhich are now being attacked by remnants by an old faction of demons.\nSo there are more higher Stakes now because if he fucks up he's not the only one getting the chop, it now the whole world and hell.\nSo as he continues this quest to find and help these goddess and there hosts he actually starts to find that he actually fully cares about this one girl,\nThat got to him and made him question himself around the end of this goodness arc.\n\nWhich I quite like because here we have some actual impact and it still going to remain because there no forgetting this time.\n\nThen after that arc is done and dusted what do they do,\nThey actually go into more and focus on the main character with his issues and what not, that they hinted in the story arc previous.\nIt basically his character arc where the explain what his deal actually is.\n\nWhich I think is very interesting and they handled it quite well actually.\nSo to summarize my positives,\nIt is probably one of the more interesting harem out there,\nJust because of how they handle it and also when it gets serious it deliverers very well.\nIt has some ok pacing.\n\nBut of corse there are a few problems,\nI think the story shouldn't have been as long as it was.\nLike they could have cut some of the girl problem arcs or made them shorter.\nBecause some of them took much longer than they should have.\nLike I not saying it pacing is bad.\nbut a feel it didn't have to drag out as long as it did.\nAlso it there are some parts to it that kinda predictable,\nAnd made it dry in those parts.\n\nAnother problem I kind of on the fence about is that even though this try's to be different from your usual harem,\nIt still get trapped in the usual pit falls that is a harem gene.\nBecause on the one hand it tries to be more than most harem,\nBut at the same time its still a harem.\n\n\nCharacters 6/10\n\nThe Main character can pretty much be summarized as a very loner like anti social person who just wants to play his games and carry one with his life and he kind of a asshole about it.\nWhich I quite liked able to relate and also he a lot more interesting than most harem \nLeards.\nHe also has a very nice development as the story goes on he become less of a dick,starts to take an interest in reality and actually cares in a sense some of the girls he is trying to help.\nIt not like a complete 180 Of his character it just now he is a little different from before.\nI also like how they explored his character.\nAnd his reaction to his situation was pretty interesting as well,\nBecause he was so detached from all these people,\nLike the girl drama thing is pretty much like a job to him,\nIt's ok next.\n\nThe side characters.\n\nMost of them are just the usual types of characters in any harem,\nLike you have a tomboy, school idol, teacher, the child hood frend, etc \n\nThere drama made most of them sightly noticeable and interesting for about a spit second, but sadly that's not enough to make them memorial characters,\nMost of them don't develop past there stereotype and drama.\nExcept for a few of the girls.\nAll though that's because they are part of the actual plot around the end.\n\nThe characters interaction where quite fun to watch for me,\nEspecially when people start remembering the things they shared with the main character.\nthere one scene in particular i remember, that I found especially funny.\nIs this part where this chick who has a goodness in her confesses to the main character in front of everyone in the class and shit hits the fan.\nIt just so funny to see it all play out.\n\nArt 5/10\n\nThe art most of the times looks very poor or very unfocused.\nThere are some manga pages that look quite nice.\nBut usually the art looks like shit.\nLike for example the background are pretty much little lines drawn in a very disorganized fashion, it like the pen or pencil got sick on the page or something like that.\nIt very ugly to look at. \n\nIt has this very upbeat moe-ish like style to it,\nLike the eyes are like really wide and they express a lot of emotions.\nIt art style reminds me of something you would see in the looney toons,\nLike this very cartoonish look but with a splash of moe in it.\n\nI kind of like the character design,\nIt's moe which I kind of dislike in a sense but not this time.\nBecause it not trying to be overly cute about it.\nSo I found it more tolerable.\nThey fit quite well,\nBut I kind of wish the demon designs where a bit scary or threatening.\n\n\n\nEnjoyment,6/10\n\nI quite enjoyed the fact that this at lest tried to be different.\nAnd that's made it more enjoyable for me.\nI also really enjoyed the main character.\nAnd really enjoyed the overall storyline.\nOther than that nothing much else is worth mentioning.\n\n\nOverall 6/10\n\nIf you really like harem then check this out,\nBecause it one of the better harem story's out there.\nif your looking for a harem that's a little different.\n\nIf you don't like harem or moe then probably stay way."}, {"id": 3030, "score": 61, "body": "Warning this review may contain spoilers.\n\n\nFirst impressions, way back before I never started reviewing I was chatting to a friend of mine who did a visual novel walkthough that this anime is based on and recommended me to watch the show.\nGoing into it I didn't have that high hopes or expections,\nBecause I had herd very mixed opinions about the show from some quick research I did.\nI was kind of thinking at the back of mind ok I watching a show about an idol relationship with this one dude and there is a harem involved so how.\nThe bar was kind of lowed.\n\nQuick side note,\nI will cover both seasons of this anime,\nBecause for some reason they decided to spit the story into two seasons,\nSo to save me time and you time I am just going to do cover both seasons at once.\n\n\nStory,6/10\n\nThe plot of white album starts out with are main character T\u00c5\u008dya who is in this relationship with this up and coming idol named yuki.\nSo I was thinking while watching this,\nThis is ether going to probably be about them growing apart more as time passes by or this is going to do a little bit of criticism about the Japanese idol industry.\nBecause In real life I have herd about some things about the Japanese idol industry and if there true or not it's a little worrisome to say the lest But back on topic.\n\nThe story kinda dose a bit of both but manly focused on the first thing I mentioned.\nWhich is fine,\nBecause it isn't exactly as forced as you think it would be.\nBecause are main character T\u00c5\u008dya ends up getting involved in all these other girls issues and some of them just want to get really close to are main protagonist if you catch my drift.\nWhile yuki is working quite hard and doesn't have much time to spend with him.\nPlus it doesn't help that there setting is in the 1980s when cell phones aren't are main stream as they are now a days or that her not being around and with other chicks kind of sniffing around isn't really the best thing for a relationship.\nAnd speaking of girls sniffing around I felt that the harem aspect was a little forced in some respects.\nLike I can understand Some of the characters reasons for why they like him,\nFor example yuki or his child hood Friend haruka.\nBecause that makes sense in the context of what there are to each over.\nBut I what really makes me go through a bit of a loop is why exactly dose the manger chick or that other idol who worked for a different company kinda show interest in him,\nLike the same friend who told me to check out this show pretty much explained it like this.\nIt because there using him as kinda a escapeism from life or something like that.\nWhich I can kinda see that.\nBut at the same time it's explained in such a vague way which first time around I didn't really pick and second time around I can see that but I feel there more to it than that or maybe I am just over thinking it.\n\nOne thing which I thought was interesting is that we get quite a bit of background plots, \nLike we get a side story about the main character and his relationship with his dad which was sort of interesting.\nWe also get this one dude trying to back mail people and shit like that and we also have a few scandals here and there.\nSo at lest we have something here that isn't just harem and romance.\nWhich over all I was quite happy this was here.\n\nI think my overall pros about the story is that it's handled maturely enough and there some part when there where kinda subtle of what going on,\nBut I feel it could just me confusing subtlety for vagueness.\nBut when I think about it could easily be a mix of both actually.\n\n\nBut I guess the quite a few nitpicks That I have is.\n\nFor one this show try's to build up to things like the black mail and scandal things which I talked about before.\nBut the problem is that the fizzles away so quickly and I don't think that was the intention behind it but I feel they didn't know how to capitalize on it ether.\nLike back for the black mail thing for a bit.\nOne of the people involved basically sold to the person he was black mailing the negatives for the photos he was using to back mail her.\nSo basically he sold the only thing he could have used to get more money from her,\nEspecially because after that the photos had been destroyed or something along those lines.\n\nAlso same thing with the scandal or the main character sleeping with other chicks,\nLike it hints that something going to happen but doesn't or isn't really handed the way it should have been.\nWhile I am on the drama topic it doesn't leave much of an impact.\nWhich is kind of sad because it seems like they tried.\n\nSo this story is pretty much we have some ideas but we not going all the way with them.\n\n\n\n\nCharacters, 5/10\n\nMain character toya is kind of bland and basic,\nThe only thing I got from him is that him and his dad have some issues and that he seems to sleep around a bit.\nWhich was a little stand out.\nBut not that interesting or noteworthy.\n\nSide characters are kinda basic as well,\n\nI thought some of the drama was slightly interesting,\nLike the girl that the main character is schooling has these issues with her mother and the child hood friends who for while couldn't play tennis because she hadn't gotten over her older brother death.\n\nOther than that nothing that really got my interest.\nAnd I really hate having to say that.\n\nThe character interactions where fine,\nBut nothing really much to write home about.\n\n\nArt, 6/10\n\nThe animion is above average at best,\nThe backgrounds are kinda mah.\n\nThe art has this very dim and almost depressing look to it.\nLike most of the scenes looks really dark even when it day time in the those scenes.\nAnd also the art style at times changes into this water paint look.\nWhich I quite liked.\n\nCharacter design look pretty average.\n\n\nSound, 5/10\n\nBoth the op and ending songs really didn't my interest,\nLike they sounding quite genetic to me.\nI guess they sounded nice but it didn't really click with me personally.\n\nEven some of songs they actually did when the idol characters where doing a song or somethings like that.\nIt also really doesn't stand out that much.\n\nThe ost was the better thing out of this,\nBecause it had a nice classical piano tracks that sounded quite nice and fitted quite well with the series.\nAnd this is coming from a person who isn't really a big fan of classical music.\n\nThe ost was done by Fujima, Hitoshi,\nWho has done music and ost for dog days if any one herd of that show.\n\n\nEnjoyment, 5/10\n\nAs far as enjoyment goes this was probably one of more average show enjoyment wise.\nLike I enjoyed the drama and all that shit.\nBut like a seid before it kinda just fizzles away.\nWhich really put a damper on my enjoyment.\nBut overall it was an ok time passer for me.\nBut I do wonder what I could have just as easily skipped this show for something more enjoyable.\n\nOverall, 6/10\n\nIf you like story's about Japanese idols then maybe you will like this.\nIt isn't exactly bad but it not really amazing ether.\nYou not going to miss much you skip this show and watch something else.\n\nIf you don't like these kinda by the books romance shows them probably avoid this at all costs.\n\n"}, {"id": 3032, "score": 61, "body": "Warning this review may contain spoilers.\n\n\nFirst Impressions, \nSo I first found out about this manga by watching it anime adaptation,\nWhich wasn't bad per say but I wanted to see the source material for the more compeled story and Also I think of the idea of a vampire who doesn't exactly fit in with the normal vampire society in a way and shares a bit more of a connection with humans.\nI think is sorta interesting.\n\n\n\nStory, 6/10\n\nThe story is about a vampire named karin who lives with her family.\nBut unlike most vampires she can walk in the day light with out problem,\nEat human food with not much hassle and the biggest thing is that she gives blood to people instead of takeing it, Thing go pretty well in till she meets Kenta Usui who has just transferred to her school.\nBeing in his presence triggers a increase in her blood at rapid rate which becomes massive nose bleeds with blood everywhere.\nIt turns out that usui has her blood affinity,\nWhich is basically a certain personality trait or feeling That each vampire has a likening to just by instinct.\nSo Karin try's to stay away of usui which doesn't work because there also next door neighbors.\nEventually he finds out her vampire nature and he decides to keep her secret and promises her family that he will look after her in the day time and they start becoming fast friends.\n\n\nThe first half is mostly about usui and Karin developing friend ship together which is slowly becoming love but we haven't got to that point yet and the issues that go with it.\nWhich is for the most part was the usual shit,\nLike for example the problems that could come up with a vampire and a human in very close proximity with each other.\nLike I am monster kind of thing or that karin at times can't control her vampire urges.\nIf you seen stuff like vampire knight or twilight it's that kind of thing.\nBut take away the emo mallow drama.\nBecause there one part where see actually nearly dies because usui going though a famliy issue with his father which triggers a reaction which nearly kills her.\nHer family try's to keep them apart doesn't work and they solve the problem and they realize there feelings for one another and start becoming a couple.\n\nOther than that there not much else to talk about expected a few back ground plot things like usui mother trying to find work, Karin older brother being an asshole and over bearing father and having to lie about your true nature to your grandma.\n\nBut it quite nice having that slow build up to there relationship,\nEven if it isn't the most interesting or original in any way.\nIt actually mangers to get the feels aspect right which I will give credit where credit is due,\nBut they could have tried to make it more interesting.\nAnd the background plots some times felt like every unnecessary filler at times.\n\nBut I did like the inclusion of how vampires can actually have a positive impact on humans depending on what emotion or felling that gets there interest.\n\nThe second half is them being a cute little couple together, getting along and building a future together. While Karin family trying to find out if there have been other vampires like her at all in history.\nThings go quite well Intill a half human half vampire moves into town and gives a slightly cynical prediction of the future of there relationship because human and vampire relationships generally don't end the most happy,\nEspecially because mostly children that are born from those relationships are stile and most of the time they especially hate their vampire parent or the whole race in general.\nWhich isn't exactly good for a young couple to hear about.\n\nEventually this leads to Karin getting kidnapped by sied half vampire family because we find out that Karin is a rare breed of vampire which pops up every now and then and has the power to save the vampire race from it's almost certain demise as vampire birth rates are very low.\nHow is that Karin will be forced to give blood to vampires in till she can't any more without killing her and then will be raped in till she gives birth so there be another one so they can repeat the cycle a new.\nEven though they technically don't have to go that far with it to get the results they want.\n\nJust before I continue I was quite impressed with this concept,\nThe idea of how far you're willing to go in order to save your race from out was quite interesting and ingenious actually when I look back on it.\nI mean you could write an entire novel based on this concept alone,\nprobably now over thinking this part more than i originally intended to.\nBut I just wanted to state for the record that putting this in was a good idea and should be given a pat on the back for effort.\n\nBut sadly it came to little to late and it was around 10-15 chapters intill the manga ended.\nSo it kinda phones it In.\n\nSo after these slightly fucked up events Karin is put in a state where she isn't exactly a vampire any more she actually more human than ever now because of reasons I don't want to spoil.\n\nSo her family comes to a very painful choice to removes karin memories of them so she can live happily as a human with usui and not have to be dragged down by vampire society and the things that come with it.\nWith usui being the only one who knows the truth.\n\nWhich is quite the bitter sweet ending,\nBecause the happiness that was made for them was done at a great personal cost.\nWhich did for some reason spark a reaction out of me.\nSo I guess it did it job in that respect.\n\n\nBut there was a few problems I did have,\n\nLike for example and I don't like being at anime adaptation in manga reviews\nBut in the anime there quite a few episodes where they where hanging out doing school stuff and Karin vampire issues come out is pubic and hi jix follow.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is that in the anime they gave more detail in the beginning of there relationship together and i feel for the manga that was I missed opportunity.\n\nAlso I wished they went into more depth about the vampire world and some of it's history.\nBecause from what we know the reason why quite a few vampires are in Japan in because a half breed outed most of the vampires in Europe to the local religious institutions.\nAnd I would like to know the reason why that half breed did it.\nBecause those actions nearly put vampires in the grave for good.\n\nCharacters, 6/10\n\nKarin as a character is ok.\nShe has a simple personally which is done well.\nShe basically very lively and some times a little clumsy at time.\nBut nothing to deep or out there as far as personally goes.\n\nBut I did like her whole trying to find a place to fit in and be happy which was nice to see.\n\nUsui at first glance he kinda looks like a thug at time.\n\nBut is actually quite smart also quite a friendly person,\nAlthough he may be at times rough around at times.\nBut what made me slightly interested in him is that,\nHe this person who is livening almost on the bottom rung and who dream is to work hard and get himself in a better place economically.\nWhich I feel is very relatable to most people out there today and I myself personally can relate to this as well.\n\n\nThe side characters.\n\nMost of them are kind of forgettable and kinda basic.\nWhich is fine.\n\nBut the only characters that stood out to me was usui mother or Karin brother or little sister.\n\nBecause they where probably on page more but also because they had I bit more to do with the story.\n\nLike Karin younger sister Anju for example.\nWho keeps an eye on her sister but also takes part in some of the more human activities that Karin dose.\nAnd you kinda feel bad when her vampire powers become fully developed that she can no longer take part in any of those things with her sister or hang out with any of the human friends she has made.\nBut what I really liked about is that it basically says that no matter how much you like the human world as a vampire one day you will have to walk away from it and leave it behind for good.\nWhich I thought was very interesting even though they didn't go much in depth about it.\n\nArt, 5/10\n\nThe art is fine it's manageable to say the less.\nThere are a few planels that do look nice when compared to the rest of the manga.\nThe backgrounds could use a lot of work because some of the back grounds need more focus.\n\nIt has quite the cartoony cute style to it,\nIt a bit to flashy for my taste.\nBut at the same time it's very good that showing the emotions of the characters.\nSo it that regard I actually quite like it.\n\nThe character designs I am not the biggest fan of.\n\nIt's just the design make it kinda hard to take these characters seriously when something actually serious is going on.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoyment, 6/10\n\nI guess I enjoyed it for what it was.\nBecause it's very basic and to the point.\n\nPlus I found it quite relaxing at times and I thought some of the elements the manga had where slightly interesting.\n\nAlso after re reading this I felt that my enjoyment is a lot more lesser than the first time I read this or watched the anime version which isn't exactly perfect.\nBut I had more fun with it back then.\nBut at the time I was getting into anime and manga.\nSo maybe it just the effect of getting more experience into the medium as a whole.\n\n\n\n\nOverall,6/10\n\nAfter thinking about it I do feel that this is probably a good recommendation for those who don't really have much experience with the anime or manga in general.\nSo it's a very good entry level manga.\nIf you want to chill out and watch a basic romance play out.\n\nBut for those who are quite a bit of experience you are going to be slightly bored with it and probably won't waste you time watching it.\nUnless you just want something very basic."}, {"id": 3034, "score": 51, "body": "arning that this review may contain spoilers \n\nFirst impressions, so stardust memory\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aka the prequel to zeta gundam which is one of my favourite in the uc time line so far.\nIn till I watch thunderbolt or origins because I have heard there really good \nSo I kind of went into this except something that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s somewhat decent,\nIt was going to explain some of the details that we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see between the first gundam and zeta.\nWhich I was very happy to find out about,\nBecause zeta didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really go into that much depth of how the titans came into power. It was very vaguely explained. So hoping to get some questions I had answered.\nSadly it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really deliver on it.\n\nStory, 5/10\n3 years after the one year between the earth and Zeon forces had ended and peace has been maintained.\nA darkness from the past is starting to come forth, as a rouge Zeon group named delaz fleet has risen from the shadows in order to finish an old score with the earth forces and to have Zeon rise again.\nMeanwhile In a military base in Australia a top secret project is under way.\nThe creation of two new prototype gundam units, The zephyranthes and the physalis are under way.\nThe delaz fleet finds out about this and plans a attack in order to get the new gundam units.\nBut during their attack they only mange to take the physalis gundam which is now being piloted by the a man known as the nightmare of Solomon.\nThe only man standing in his way is main character kou who is a training pilot. who while in the attack manged to keep the zephyranthes gundam out of Zeon hands. But to make matters worse the physalis gundam contains nukes.\nSo join kou and his crew as there race ageist the clock begins to stop major war from braking out.\n\nSo the basic story line or plot is pretty much main character and crew mates involved in a game of cat and mouse between military factions. Trying to get this gundam unit back.\nWhich as a standalone story for a gundam show is all right, Because it takes itself serious enough and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still sticks to the theme of war is hell, And the other themes that gundam is well known for. And they have the main charter getting used to active military service and all the things that come with it.\nThere also a nice little romance as well, Between the main character this engineer chick That I felt was alright handed alright.\nSo its above average.\n(Even though I still question the logic behind putting top secret project and nukes in all honesty Isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly the most well defended base they could have picked, and of course it was the Australians the dropped the ball)\nSo any way as a standalone story it all good but sadly that also where its biggest weakness is and my biggest gripe with this show is.\nBecause this is supposed to be a bridge between the first gundam and zeta gundam. A prequel / sequel and in that context this show is horrible at that aspects if one looks at it through the lens of this is a prequel / sequel.\n\nBecause let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just say that continuity isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly this show strong suit. In fact the events that take place in this show don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really have much to connection to what happens in zeta or any relationship to first gundam wants so ever. Most of the things that happen in this show don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even come into play.\nIn fact the only thing connecting this to zeta is that though the events of the story at the end.\nwe find out what trigged the titans forming and we see a few characters from zeta showing up for a quick scene or two. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost like the story came alive and a punched you in the face just for watching and completing it \nSo while I on the negative train I might as well mention that this story is kind of forgettable and isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bringing anything new to the table.\nWhat I mean by that is that this story as a whole is like a copy and paste of ever theme that the uc time line gundam has ever had.\nLike the war is hell, freedom for the spacenoids and etc.\nWhich on the basic level is ok, \nbut when I think about it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t doing much with those ideas and themes. It mostly being used as basic favouring because.\nThese ideas aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really being explored or a new point of view being brought to the table.\nWhich is sad because they could have come up with something new or fresh but they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\nNow you can argue and say that because this is a prequel / sequel they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly have to do anything with those ideas or that those themes and ideas are not the main focus of the show and at the end of the day This is side story. Which just takes place in the same universe.\nBut this was made quite a few years after zeta came out.\nI would think that they could come up with better ideas with the time they had or even a better plot for that matter \nBut they just gave us the same shit in different rapper.\n\n\nCharacters 5/10 \n\nThe main character kou was ok. \nHe this kind of chill dude who has a thing for tech. \nwho thought out the course of the series becomes more hardened the more he experiences real combat.\nWhich I thought was nice because it added some depth to his character.\nBecause in the beginning of the series I really couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put heads or tails on what his personality is . He felt very hollow to me. \nWhich is a problem for me, Because most gundam main characters usually have a more notable personality or some sort of back story.\nLike for example Domon kasshu or kamille bidan,\nWho have a more memorable personality. \n\nSide characters are all right,\nThey did the roles they had well.\nThey had nice banter I guess that I enjoyed watching \n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just personality wise, But aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really memorable.\nThey just feel like carboard cut-outs to me.\nWhich is a thing I am sick of saying but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very true.\n\nThe only thing that stood out for me character wise was the romance between kyo and Nina.\nWhich far as anime romances wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bad because I have a bit of chemistry together \nWhich was nice, but I guess my only nick pick is that there relationship feels a little dry and forced to me. \nBecause there relationship together progress at quite the fast rate. Like one ep she slightly has the desire to see what type of person kyo is and then the next ep talking about feeling and shit.\nIts feels unnatural to me.\nAlthough it could just be that this series only had a 13 ep so they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have time to pad out there relationship.\n\n\nArt 6/10\n\nThe animation looked alright. It could have been better though.\nBecause there are a few parts where the animation takes a bit of a dip down wards in quality.\n\nThe backgrounds look all right and add a bit of grit to it.\n\nThe battles are alright in animation wise because I have a very naturel flow about them.\nBut on the bad side there not exactly the most fun to watch.\n\nArt style is fine was well.\n\nThe charter designs are fine.\nJust the standard shit that we have all seen before \n\nI really do like the more up dated mech designs for the older models,\nBecause they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel that clunky anymore and feel more like well-oiled war machines.\n\n\nSound 6/10\n\nI really like the first opening song and the other opening song and there ending themes are very boring to me and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really stand out that much. I would have gotten more enjoyment if I listened to paint dry.\n\nBut at the same time I see why people might like these,\nBut for me there just crap.\n\nOst was quite nice,\nBetter than I thought it would be.\n\nSome very good tracks in there.\nThey fitted very well and was on point \nBut nothing I would gone out of my way to listen to by its self.\n\nThe ost was done by Urakami, Yasuo,\nWho has worked on shows like,\nProject arms and gundam seed.\n\nThe dub was alright and so was the sub.\n\nI liked both.\n\n\nEnjoyment 5/10\n\nAs far was enjoyment goes.\nI enjoyed this show for what it was,\nBut my enjoyment doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go beyond that point. \nFor me was one of those one timer experiences. Because this is something I would not watch again.\n\n\nOverall 5/10 \nIf you like gundam or basic Mecha shows and just want a quick one timer then check this out.\nBecause its aright as a whole, But it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really go beyond that point.\nBut at the same You could just was easily skip this series because it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really add much to gundam as a whole.\n\nif you want something that stands out more or in fact isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so basic and done to death.\nWatch something else."}, {"id": 3035, "score": 50, "body": "Warning this review may contain spoilers \n\nFirst impressions, so I didn't really now what to expect,\nThis being written by the some person who did Oreimo.\nI didn't have the most high of standards for this.\nBased on the premise I expected it to be more incest baity.\nWhich don't get me wrong it still is,\nIt just less incest baity than it's predecessor.\n\nBut that isn't exactly saying much,\nWhen take into account the whole step brother and sister making erotic story's thing.\n\n\n\nStory, 5/10\n\nSo in latest incest bait of the season.\nAre story begins with Main character masamune a high school student,\nwho is above average erotic light novel writter.\nWho writes not just As a hobby but also to take care of his step sister sagiri who is a hikikomori.\nBut things are not looking great for masamune as he is currently in the middle of writers block.\nWhich is preventing him from coming up with the next flaptastic idea for a light novel.\nBut not all things are grim as masamune mysterious illustrator ero manga sensei still stands by him even though they never met before.\nOne day he decides to watch a live stream done by ero manga sensei for the first time ever. \nOnly to find out that ero manga sensei is actually his step sister.\nSo after he goes up to her room to confirm it.\nThe two decide to work together more closely in order to make a great light novel series, Which I expect more than just creative juices flowing I order to make it.\n\n\nSo the storyline line is pretty much them working together as a team.\nTo make the next big hit in the light novel world.\n\nat first glance it looks like a very vanilla, copy and paste ,seen it done before multiple times kind of story.\nWhich don't get me wrong it is exactly as i described.\nBecause a story about two siblings who where kind of distance from each other and then they slowly start developing a closer bond with one another though a hobby or etc.\nIs not original or thought provoking in the slightest.\nIn fact I can list off at lest 10 shows I have seen with a similar concept.\n\nAnd if I am being completely honest I don't think that this show as the ability or writing behind it to push it beyond a vanilla story, at lest for me.\n\nBecause it doesn't have the maturity like for example koi kaze dose or the sexualized over the top nature like kissxsis dose.\nIt pretty much dips it toes in the water with out making much a splash.\n\nWhich on the plus or negative side Depending on your preference.\nwe probably won't get a incest is wincest ending,\nWhich I couldn't care less about if they go down that route or not.\nBut being a brain child from the person who oreimo, I won't hold my breath.\nIf they do.\nBut enough an there relationship together we will dive into later.\n\nI think the whole light novel industry backdrop is interesting and it cool the see some of the work that goes behind making light novels.\nKinda like bakuman except in this context it was for manga.\nBut unlike bakuman which did some sort of a criticism on the manga industry,\nEro manga sensei doesn't want to even though it could.\n\nIn fact it kinda praises it a bit to much, Which I feel is a little dishonest.\nConsidering some of the Shade that happens from time to time.\n\nNow I know I kinda Been bitching about what this story could have been instead of talking about what it is and how dose it fair with others of it kind.\nAnd for what it is its very average.\nSo it's a vanilla show,\nthe whole brother and sister team making a light novel together is cute and slightly endearing. \nAnd a whole lot better to watch than Oreimo sibling duo being assholes to One another. Because that shit becomes a boring very quickly.\n\nSo it's not exactly braking any new ground in any way,\nBut at the same time it's not done in a way where my critic side would rip it to sunder and send it to review hell.\n\n\nI think my positives story wise is that.\nIt's simple and straightforward, and it honest with what it is.\n\nIt's also pretty tame fan service wise,\nWell tame for me I guess because from what I have heard though the grapevine that some people think the fan service is a little to much.\n\nBut for me personally watching the likes of high school dxd and hentai has pretty much made me mostly immune to most levels of fan service to the point it's doesn't seem the phase me much any more.\nSo take the fan service thing with a grain of salt.\nIt's a positive and a negative for me.\nBut this is just word to the wise.\n\nBut the big negative I have with the story is that it has elements that could make it a little better,\nIf it wanted to use them.\nIt's one of those cases where a show on it own it fine but has ideas and elements that could make it a whole lot better than it already is.\nWhich is the main problem I have with quite a few slice of life series in general.\n\nMost slice of life series on paper have some interesting ideas ,\nbut in practice is very lack laster at best.\n\nBecause most of the time they relay on the common tropes for there plot beat. instead of going outside the box a little.\n\n\nSo Eromamga sensei for me is It's like meat lovers pizza but it forgot the meat.\n\n\n\nCharacters, 5/10\n\nMain character masamune is very cookie cutter personality wise,\nThere really isn't much of a personality there.\nFrom what I seen he seems like a normal high schooler who has a passion for writing light novels.\nhis passion for light novels gives him a little depth, but he still cardboard cutout character who I have seen many times before.\nBut he's a lot better than the main character from oreimo I say the lest.\nWhich isn't really saying much, but when it comes to basic characters like him there not much to work with.\n\nHis step sister sagiri is a lot better than I thought she would be,\nPersonally wise she just the shy girl who stays inside way to much for her own good.\n\nWhich is something I have seen meay times before, so I wasn't exactly hyped for her character type.\n\nBut I thought her whole ero manga sensei was slightly interesting.\nBecause at first look you wouldn't exactly picture her as a person who would be involved in ecchi and hentai related things.\nIt's funny to see this shy girl drew erotic art work.\nAnd I find that difference between her real life and online life really interesting and relatable.\n\nBecause everyone has a online and real life persona that are slightly different form each other and i think that pretty relatable especially for the younger generations who are online quite a bit and have these online personas.\nWhich I am just a sucker for.\n\nNow before I talk about the side characters, \nI would like to mention that the relationship between masamune and sagiri is way better than the relationship in oreimo,\nBecause there actually good reasons for why masamune actually give a shit or care about his step sister. \nUnlike in oreimo where they just live together and they slightly share common interests and for most part have this love/hate relationship and the main character just gets involved in shit because he has nothing else better to do.\n\nBut in Eromamga for example,\nMain character parents are dead so he doesn't have much of family except his step sister.\nSome one needs to pay those bills and they share a common interest together.\n\nSo they have a better reason to have this closer relationship together and it actually has a objective which is to make light novels together.\nUnlike oreimo which was mostly episodic crap.\n\nSo side character are also kinda cookie cutter was well.\nThere also cardboard cutouts as well.\nBut there not as bland as I expected them to be.\nThey have some slight quirks about them which makes them stand out a bit more,\nBut it still feels very one note.\nLike for example there a girl who dresses up like a elf and plays piano naked and another girl who's in middle school who likes dick or something along those lines.\nIf you take away those quirks they become the usual tsudare and genki girl.\n\nOne character that slightly broke this mold was another character who writes light novels like are main character dose,\nExcept she more extreme in her passion of reading and writing than are main character is.\nIn fact when they first meet she kinda comes off like she hates the main character guts and they kind of come into conflict.\nBut it turns out she like a super fan of the main character light novel series and wishes it would continue.\nBecause it was a book series that she enjoyed to her very core.\n\nI thought that was interesting,\nIt didn't last for long though and it didn't have much build up.\nBut I thought it was nice to have this.\n\nAnother thing I want to meanion that some of the characters seem a little to innocent especially those who are involved in erotic shit.\n\n\nArt, 6/10\n\nAnimation is alright it's very smooth and well polished.\nBackgrounds are Average at best, some scenes they look like they been painted on. \n\nArtwork looks good, lots of pretty colors which I liked.\nBecause it not in your face about it.\nEven though in some scene it was a little to bright.\nThey could tone down on the color filters a bit.\n\nArt style is generic light novel shit.\n\nCharacter designs are fine.\n\nThere less sexualized than I thought they would be,\nBut it would just be that the person who did these character designs hasn't got much of an idea for erotic art.\n\n\n\n\nSound,6/10\n\nShockingly I actually like both the opening and ending song,\nThere very happy go lucky tunes.\nWhich go well with the show and I enjoy listening to them.\nBut there not music that I would look for or download on my computer to listen to them bye themselves.\n\nSadly there not much of an ost.\nIn fact the ost is the opting and ending sougs.\n\nSo probably not worth mentioning who did it anyway.\n\nVoice acting for sub was fine for the most part.\nDon't have anything positive or negative to say about it.\n\n\n\nEnjoyment, 5/10\n\nI liked the whole idea behind it and some of the characters are slightly funny.\nAnd some scenes made me lol a bit.\nBut it didn't really go beyond just a time passer for me.\n\nI will probably forget it in a week after finishing it.\n\nAnd that all she wrote.\n\n\nOverall, 5/10\n\nIf you liked oreimo you will probably like this.\nBecause it pretty similar to it in almost every way except it isn't trying to go for the lets Not label all otaku culture as a bad thing.\n\nAny well experienced anime fan will probably forget it in a week,\nBecause at the end of the day it isn't do much that hasn't been done before.\n"}, {"id": 3036, "score": 61, "body": "Warring this review may contain spoilers.\n\nFirst impressions, so my first impressions is.\nThat this is about a bunch of supper powered human looking aliens fighting it out in a city wide battle torment in order to reach paradise with there master.\nSounds fucking cool and I want to see what they do with it.\n\nStory, 6/10\n\nOne day while two time college entrance exam failure minato is walking in depression from his lastest failure of try's to get into college of his dreams.\nWhile in dispear an extra thick shrine maiden falls from the sky and lands on top of him named musubi.\nDuring this encounter he finds that musubi being chased by a two women dressed in s&m outfits who are shooting lighting out of there hands.\nDuring there escape minato finds out that musubi is something called a sekirei, \nWhich is are this group of 108 strong super power human like aliens that have been looked after by the local corporation \n(which are mostly comprised of hot milfs, thick as fuck school girls, pretty boys that make your hart go doki doki and the odd trap and loli.)\n\nApparently the main character has been chosen against his will to take place in a city wide death torment called the sekirei plan where sekirei and there masters called ashikabi\n(which are certain people who attract sekirei almost like a magnet because of reasons I will dive into later)\nFight it out for the ultimate prize.\nwhich minato now finds himself involved in the fight for his life in quest for this ultimate prize so afterwards he can continue his normal life and also live in peace with musubi.\n\nSo sekirei if you couldn't tell is another one of those battle harems which is quite common especially now a days.\nwhich I haven't got the biggest love for anymore being completely honest here because of how oversaturated the genre has been in recent years. \nBut battle harem aspect aside I would probably say that sekaikei is probably one of the better battle harems out there not because it's deep, complex or any thing like that.\nBut more on the line of it has a simple story that's it's wants to tell and it sticks to that story to the every end faults and all.\nwhich is why I wound call it the everyday man of the battle harem genre because it try's to have a few themes about friend ship and comradey which it portrays in quite a straightforward manner and its not a defftive that the main character going to win just because he has a few more sekirei in his team than some of the over contestnice \n\nActually when I boil it down its plot to it's most basic stature and think about it sekirei pretty much plays like a Pokemon game except the Pokemon are hot human like aliens.\n(Maybe they should have run it by the slogan \"gotta to fuck them all\")\nBut I digress.\n\nSo has far as storyline and content is consured \nSekirei has a basic plot which follows the formula of.\nMain character gets involved in drama or some shit while this tournament goes on in the background. which most of the time involves a girl who got problems and after that shit or drama is done.\nhe gets another sekirei added to his ever growing team which the story will repeat this process about six for times which kind of gets old really fast it's the usual thing In harems there a male lead and a bunch a girls with problems which the main character solves using his dick.\nExcept in this case the problems that come up wasn't always an external problem sometimes it was more a of an internal thing Which made the confits slightly interesting and I did want to see where they would go with them.\n\none example of one of the drama or problem I found interesting was \nwhen the character Homura who is a male sekirei stating to get attaced to are main character and before you think that is a one of those characters finding out about there sexual orientation it's nothing like That because it's reveled that hormura has a unique biology in the sense that he can't actually control what gender he is or his power to a certain extent.\nAnd it's not the fact he falling for a dude or Turing into a women because of his body reaction to the main character that's the main cause of his problem \nit's apart of it but what really bothers him is the fact he has no control over his own destiny and is pretty much a play thing to the winds of fate which he tries to fight against. \nWhich I thought was pretty interesting idea even though afterwards when the problem was fixed they kind of played it off for gags which got less funny every time they brought it up like how meny times you you have to show that hormura is slightly embarrassed because he having homo lust for the main character.\n\nThe after we get though about 2/3 of the story.\nWe finally get into more off this battle tournament and more focus on the history of the sekirei.\n\nSo the actual tournament it's self isn't bad as far as tournament arcs are considered.\nBecause in this point in time main character actually has more of a reason to why he wants to win because before he just wanted to win in order to be with musubi.\nBut now he wants to use the prize to revive all the sekirei that has fulling at this tournament and reverse some of the damage it has caused on others around him and also keep it out of hands which could lead to the death of most of humanity.\nWhich is kinda a generic reason but it's better than not taking this thing seriously which he was doing before and it doesn't follow the usual main character fights everyone with his team and beats everyone and wins.\nIt's more along the lines of he unofficially won because of events outside his control and people just kinda went with it and to be honest if the tournament keeped on and continued on officially to its ending pretty sure the main character would have lost most of his team and might of won by the skin of his teeth.\nthe action all right and there enough background and side plot to make the battles have more impact not just in the case of who wins the gets the ultimate prize but also from a character perspective as well which was good to have.\n\n\nNow just before the continent with the characters and what not I would like to mention that the history of the sekirei was slightly interesting and is another reason why I call this the Everyman of battle harems.\nBecause it's reviled that sekirei have been on are planet before of corse in yee olden times and that the ashikabi are people who are descended from sekirei and human breeding with each other.\nWhich is why I think this is the Everyman because any one could be a ashikabi from a rich politician to a homeless man because as long as they have sekirel blood in them they are able to be in this battle tournament.\nOf course one problem I do have is that they don't really explain much about where the sekirei come from because the information we are given is that they came from outer space and that there are ships full of sekirei that are possibly underground waiting to be found again.\nSo my question is what are they and who made them because they look and act Human and they are can also breed with humans without much difficulty.\nAre they are race that similar to humans and they found are planet on accident or where they made by some other alien race for god knows what and where sent here to mate with the local population.\nGuess we never will know but that just was a little nit pick I wanted to bring up.\n\n\nSo I guess my pros are that's slightly better written than some harems story's out there and it's doesn't try to over stay it's welcome.\nIt's not amazing like golden boy or high school dxd story wise but it's not a harem I would forget in a week I would probably forget it in a year.\n\nI think my cons are is that some of the drama the story brings up becomes pointless at times and brought up for gags after they solve the problem.\nWhich I didn't like because it took some of the inpact out of those problems.\nLike for example what I meanion before with Homura when his problem started to become a run on gag which is didn't like to much.\n\n\n\nCharacters 6/10\n\nThe main character minato is another on of those bland harem protagonist that are a dime a dozen.\nHe just the nice guy who though the events of the series becomes slightly more manly and take charge of the situations he is in.\nI kinda which that he wasn't like this because some of the other side characters have a more distinct personally and are more extreme in there beliefs and morals I just wish he wasn't just the nice guy that every likes and some people dislike because of his somewhat fence attitude. \n\n\nSide characters are probably slightly more interesting but most of them are still the usual tipcle character you find in most story's but I give credit they didn't feel like cardboard cutouts because there as enough characterzion to make them stand out slightly but enough for me to say of that's him/her personality \n\nSome characters that where slightly better written and had more of a personality that's its bothered me less than usual.\nOne example of this is Hayato Mikogami a character when we fist meet him comes of as a extremely childish rich person who pursues his wims and interests with no thoughts to who it will effect what's so ever and also thinks this tournament is a a game.\nAs a series continues on we find at that even though he is rich and all the freedom in the world it doesn't take away the fact that he is very lonely and has no one who really understands him but that all changed when he meet the sekirei and now he isn't lonely because he has people who accept him for who is and nothing more.\n\nInterestingly enough a lot of the other major players in this tournament have that similar dynamic where they come off as assholes but though the interactions with there sekirei this isn't exactly the case.\n\nWhile on the topic of the sekirei I think the relationships that sekirei have with there ashikabi are slightly interesting because it's pretty much a mix of best friend, lover, or just loyal servant even though I feel that the relationships themselves kinda progress way to fast like there are even some ashikabi who are dating there sekirei with plans are marrying them in the future even if they known each other for about a month or two.\nBut the reason for that could be that ashikabi and sekirei have a spiritual bond which allows the understand each other in a deep way I guess.\n\n\nArt, 6/10\n\nArtwork is decent most of the time except for a few panels that look a little un focused or panels that look amazing.\nThe backgrounds look alright although when there doing there fight scenes and shit gets destroyed the background dose a ver sub par job at show casing the level of destruction that going on around them.\n\nThe fight scenes themselves are alight but the fights don't really flow every well and most of the battles are son using the special attack to finish the fights instead of basic hand to hand combat which we do get but its only every now and then.\n\nI like the characters designs for some of the characters,\nMost of them are the sekirei character designs which look very nice and are easy on my eyes.\n\n\n\n\nEnjoyment, 5/10\n\nWhen I first watched the anime and read the manga of this.\nI liked it quite a bit it's was a show to me that I would watch every now and then to pass the time if I was bored or wanted a quick chuckle.\nNow a days it's still has that effect to an extent but it isn't the series I would go back to every now and then for enjoyment it's become more a once in a blue moon enjoyment for me. I will probably won't ever read it again unless I feel like taking a trip down memory lane.\nAs far what I enjoyed about it Well I liked the fights and I thought the story as entertaining enough even if it was basic as fuck and every dated by today's standards.Character interactions where slightly more engaging than I thought they would be.\nSo I guess I enjoyed this manga for slightly going over the expectations I had for it.\n\n\n\nOverall, 6/10\n\nSo if your a person who enjoys harem and people fighting I would recommend you give this manga a shot.\nIt's not as good is high school dxd, golden boy or Rosario vampire but it ten times better than most generic battle harems with school and teenagers.\nIt's a good time passer.\n\nIf your not into harem or you want something with a bit more serious stay away\nBut it's not like anyone pays attention to what I say anyway so why do a bother.\n\nIf you want a good tournament battle and not getting it here probably go watch or read any of the fate stay night series or the dark tournament arc from yu yu hakusho. "}, {"id": 3037, "score": 53, "body": "Warning this review may contain spoilers \n\n\nFirst impression, so my first thoughts going into this show if I have to be honest I was going in completely builed the only thing I have hard is that it's like fate zero and there character like izyea from durarara.\nSo I went in with pretty low expectations because this has been quite hyped and in my experience it's better to ignore the hype and go see a show like this from a more impassual mindset in order to reach a clear conclusion as a critic and also not have my enjoyment factor be bogged down by high expectations which this show would probably never meet in a million years.\n\n\nStory, 5/10\nSo by dear readers have you ever thought what would happen if say your favorite characters from anime, manga, light novels eta came to life in the real world.\nIf you have ever pondered this question then I have some good news for you \nBecause Re creators answers it in a very generic way.\nthey fight because of reasons to numerous to name.\n\nAre story begins with bland main character S\u00c5\u008dta Mizushino which for the rest of this review I am going to call seasonal anime kun.\nWho though events that are complicated to explain.\npretty much what happens is main character goes into an anime.\na character from that anime he watching becomes real and there a magical girl who wants to destroy all of humanity with fictional characters because for various reasons and seasonal anime kun teams up with more fictional characters that just want to go home and leave humanity in tact.\nI seriously do question what kind of drugs these people are on to come up with this shit and I also must ask where can I get this stuff from.\n\nSo re creators is what happens when you mix meta writing, a bunch anime stereotypes and lots of drugs.\nwhen these elements are mixed together they create an unholy spawn of satan which as been born from the entropy Of a medium that's already on it last legs.\n\nBecause in all honesty this is probably the most absurd idea for a plot I have seen in quite a while but I will give them props you thinking outside the box a bit.\n\nBut at the same time the idea of popular Japanese media becoming real because reasons and there fighting each other for a multitude of reasons.\nIt feels like a less coherent version of fate stay night because it has an almost similar concept and plot beat. \nBecause it dose have those philosophy and morality charged battles that fate stay night and other shounen battle titles are famous for having and there enough background plot to keep you slightly interested to the conflict itself.\n\nBut I ask myself this question and ask this to my readers as well.\nWhat else is there to this story than just a death battle and the background plot of these characters adapting to life in the real world.\n\nWell nothing really much because the story itself feels like a badly written fan fic by a weebo high on crack and hyped up for the next battle shounen tournament arc.\nAnd even if the battles and the slice of life elements are interesting to an extent.\n\n\nBut it gets bogged down because The story and plot itself has this odd obsession with pseudo Japanese nationalism and otaku pandering.\nWhich takes away any kind of deepth this story could actually have.\nBut at the same time I shouldn't expect much from a show is pretty much a battle royal with popular Japanese media as fighters.\n\nBecause though out the series itself they show case how effective the Japanese government was able to sort this shit out very quickly,\nwhile also organizing counter measures to stop the evil media characters at bay.\nAnd for some reason this show sounds like it's sightly jacking itself off of how it's only poplar Japanese media that's coming to life in the real world and only the otakus can help stop this crisis.\nEven most of the dailong is taking about the Japanese government or a bunch of otaku pandering shit like how great anime and manga is.\n\n\nIt's comes off like some weird hybrid of fate stay night and gate.\nExcept it's taken the worse aspects of those series and quantified it ten times over. Like say what you must about psudo philosophy battles of fate stay night. But at lest those came from a psudo historical context because King Arthur was a chick apparently and even if it was psudo.\nthey at lest built apon and tried it make it interesting.\n\nBut with re creators is just taking basic character stereotypes who come from completely different worlds and giving them a basic moral alinement.\nThen give the viewer slight information why they are like this and they just run with it.\n\nAnd to me it's just Comes off as lazy and poorly written because it doesn't really leave much of an impression on me.\n\nAnd This is a battle royal story and I wasn't expecting much from it anyway.\nbut good dam when there no action this story is boring is hell.\nLike 3/4 of the show is just talking and info dumping and it just so many episodes are wasted on just banter and info dumping.\nMost of the time it isn't even relevant and just wastes episodes.\nJust so much dead time like in honesty they could have finished this is about 15 episodes not 22 episodes .\nEspecially with the recap episode we had which isn't needed because people already now what's happened especially because characters will bring it up anyway.\n\nSo story wise re creators is a cluster fuck of ideas that have been done better before and there are shows similar to it that are better.\n\n\n\nCharacters, 6/10\n\nMain character seasonal anime watcher kun is possibly the most blandest character I have ever seen to date and that's saying something.\nBecause the only thing that he has as a character is that he very shy and likes drawing and that's the extent of his character.\nHe just another self insert character that you will forget in a week in fact I have to keep reminding myself that he actually exists.\n\nHe feels like a background character that just given the main character role because the writers couldn't think up any decent characters.\nEven if they explained why he important to the story it doesn't really matter because he doesn't do anything he is just passive as fuck mostly and when I see him on screen I keep on getting PTS flash backs from guilty crown main character shu who was also a Passive.\n\n\nThe side characters are a whole lot more interesting than the main character,\nWell actually to be more precise the fictional characters are the ones who are interesting. Even if they are basic stereotypes at lest they have personally and actually do something.\n\nAnd one thing that surprised me is how they react to there situation.\n\nLike one example is that during a huge battle where one of the characters involved was a magical girl and after the fight was finished.\nShe brakes down mentally because she comes from a very idealistic world where the concept of collateral damage or people being hurt And in pain Isn't really a concept she used to and when she sees the destruction around her that she herself has helped cause she just collapses on the ground and brakes down. \nAnd while watching this scene I thought that was \n\n\nAnd another thing which was quite interesting is that the characters themselves are developing more character traits the longer they stay in the real world because there getting exposed to things they never experienced before or haven't experienced yet and there not confined by the limitations of the respected story's they have come from. \nWhich is interesting because these characters or these versions on them have become slightly different and been apart from there world's for so long that they are starting to become there own entity outside there place of origin.\n\nThe other side characters who are quote on quite real are boring as fuck and I do t care about them in the slightest.\nAnd are mostly used for info dumps or react how normal people would react in those situations.\n\n\nThe main villain that I am going to call evil magical girl.\n\nPretty comes off more As a edge-lord/ emo hybrid.\nBecause all she talks about is sadness and pretentious monologs about Creation and how she will get revenge for her creator.\nBecause her creator killed her self and thats the rest of humanity fault that happened apparently.\nSo she wants to make every one feel the sadness and dispaer like her creator did In Her last moments alive.\n\nAnd I can understand the reason behind getting revenge for the person that your creator and gave you life.\nBut at the same time her reasoning behind it comes of as petty and childish.\n\nIt basically this.\n\" I suffer so I make the rest of the world suffer with me \"\nThat's pretty much all the reason behind it.\n\n\nThe character interactions I find interesting to a point.\nBut after a while they become repetitive and boring.\nAnd I stopped caring after a while.\n\n\n\n\nArt, 7/10\n\nThe animation looks pretty decent and flows quite organically.\nThe backgrounds look decent as well.\n\nArt pretty is good as well like there a few parts where shits a little off model or things get a little blurry.\n\nNow the fight scenes are quite flashy and don't exactly hate it.\nbut it would be nice to have some battles that don't just boil down to using flashy gimmicks to win.\nlike it would be nice to see more difference in combat abilities that aren't about the super natural powers or big robots with hyper beam canons that blow up half a city block.\n\n\nI actually quite like the characters destined because there quite varied and remind me of quite a few different shows which I quite liked the trip down memory lane.\n\n\n\n\nSound, 6/10\n\nI really like a first opening because I find it it quite engageing ans gets me hyped for each ep. The ending and other op and ending sounds alight,but for me it isn't somethings I would go out of my way to listen to.\n\nThe ost is pretty good, if you liked sword art online or guilty crown ost I think you might like the ost for re:creators. Because there quite similar in music and beat to it.\nThe ost and music was done by Sawano, Hiroyuki who has worked on music and ost for series such as guilty crown, kill la kill and zombie Lon.\n\nVoice acting was on point, nothing really sounded out of place to be.\n\n\n\nEnjoyment, 5/10\n\nWell I enjoyed the ride for what's it's worth and I was engaged enough to actually pay attention and not get bored. But after a while as the story continued I keep on losing interest and honestly I keep watching it even though the novelty of it wore off completely after 11 episodes Because I wanted to write this review.\nAnd it's continuing more than it actually has to.\nBecause honestly the could have finished this story in about 15 episodes and it would be be ok.\n\nLike I probably prefer fate stay night over this.\n\nBut at lest a got a great drinking game out this show.\nbecause everyone time someone mentions the Japanese government or anime and manga you take a drink and if you do that you will be shit faced by ep 3 or ep 5 depending on your alcohol tolerance \n\n\n\n\nOverall, 5/10\n\nIf you like shows like fate stay night or future diary then you probably like this show,\nBecause as far as shounen battle series all things considered it not exactly bad it's just another very average and slightly overhyped show.\nAnd it's definitely not the modern classic that some people hype it up to be because in a few years time this show will be forgotten like most shows of it elk.\n\nIf your looking for something with more substance and depth and not just just cool fights. then probably better off just stick with fate stay night or watch hunter X hunter or yu yu hakusho.\n"}, {"id": 3039, "score": 65, "body": "Warning: this review contains spoilers.\n\nFirst impressions: Before i got into this show, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d heard it was one of the best horror anime ever to come out of the anime medium. Not only that, but and it has a lot of thematic depth and grey morality and hearing that kinda got me interested. It's about a small town and there odd things going down with people dying by a mysterious sickness and there apparently sighting of the recently departed hanging around town at night.\n\nStory,5/10\nDuring a normal summer in the small rural town named Sotoba, all seems well. But after this new family has moved in there has been Theses case of mysterious deaths that have Been happening in the village With people dropping like flies. the local doctor Toshio is trying his best to find the root cause of these deaths with the help of his best friend the local monk named Seishin While there investigating. Local City boy Natsuno Yuuki has this feeling that someone is watching him after the mysterious death of his best friend toru and his local stalker Megumi. So are these deaths caused by some mysterious virus or is something more sinister afoot. Well spoiler alert it's actually vampires. So to start off there is a general consensus in quite a few circles that anime and horror don't really mix well and feel that Shiki is no exception to that mindset, because even if it's a more realistic take on vampires in a modern setting. I wasn't really scared and the only reason I kept watching was that I felt was a small case of morbid curiosity to see where the story would go. Because at face value it has quite a bit going for it theme-wise as it talks about survival, criticisms of human society and the evils of humanity. Which honestly has been done to death already at this point in time and done better but I digress. Now I feel that Shiki does a great job of building up its story the first few episodes of Shiki are probably some of the best episodes setup wise and when I first originally watched this show I had this feeling of morbid curiosity as I wondered what was going to happen next, and shiki does a very good at pulling you in and getting you intrigued in a similar vein to Higurashi where you don't really know what's happening and your just along for the ride.\nNow when it comes to the conflict between the humans and the Shiki which is the main focus, I feel from a collectivist standpoint both sides are pretty much as bad as each other in my viewpoint of morality, ethics and etc. \nBut from an individual standpoint i would say certain characters are more justified in their actions and behavior than others, because most of the people in this village are to put it nicely are assholes during life and during unlife. one of the villagers who becomes a shiki is actually a pedophhie who exclusively targets little boys and one villager who is so xenophobic towards outsiders to such a degree that she would even make the ku klux klan seem tolerant by comparison, so none of these people is innocent or clean as some people may think and it kinda takes away the moral ambiguity of the conflict as human/shiki seem to use this conflict to justfly there inhuman acts towards each over. Which causes the major underlying issues that I have with Shiki is that it tries to play off as an emotional series with deep themes to make it seem mature. but handling wise it's anything but, because it pretty much plays out like a slice of life/ soap opera with vampires and it not like I am against this more emotional driven narrative but the problem is it doesn't really work past a gimmick, when they try to expand upon the story you start seeing these big holes in logic, which evidently makes me not care about what happens.\nLike to list a few examples of things not making sense, One of main themes of shiki is survival and the reason i bring this up is It was established that Shiki take at least a cup worth of blood per feeding until the person dies or becomes a shiki. yet why didn't the shiki just cycle through different people in rotation, because if your a shiki who doesn't want to kill humans then surely that's a more efficient way of survive with the added bonus of not having an angry mob after you. Because what's the worst that could happen? cases of mild anaemia popping up at random. \nwhen I think about that's it kinda makes the grey morality conflict kinda Null and void and any drama that comes from it now feels forced and to make it worse. I have seen people trying to defend it by saying the shiki had no choice and the humans are truly evil for trying to defend themselves against the bloodsucking undead that will suck them dry.\n\nAnother example is the main villains the Kirishiki goal of making a vampire village so that shiki can have a home and not have to worry about humans, that all well and good but my question is how exactly is this vampire village going to work exactly if they don't have any blood. I know that people will say they can just kidnap people from other towns, But people will notice. For the basic reason, that soba doesn't the ecosystem to support such a village in the long run and to prove my point sotaba was a village with give or take 300 people and when the local shiki set up shop in the span of a few months they reduced the local population by half With an attrition rate like that they would have a better chance of making a vampire ghetto in a city than a village in the countryside. \nAlso even though they wanted to make this vampire village they seem to be doing things that are very counterproductive. because it's also established that Shiki can mind control anyone they have bitten, so why didn't the shiki just bite everyone and then mind control people to do what they want. Which is more safer and easier than killing people to build up this undead population. Because having a bunch of the undead running around at night is totally not suspicious at all?\n\nThe other little nitpicks i have is that this series, is that I wish it had more episodes because there are actually scenes that were cut out from this series and to add insult to injury the scenes that were cut out had a lot of background details. which takes away from the experience as a whole and makes it seems hollow. \nI also feel that shiki supernatural elements are poorly defined as a result and also the fact the original source material never expanded upon it, like what makes a person rise up as a shiki or in some cases transform into super vampires with cheat mode enabled. The only thing we know about shiki is that they defy medical science along with other laws of nature and that only the special snowflake people get to rise up or if you're super special snowflake transform. Which translates to plot convince and plot holes as the definition of special is very vague and allows anything to happen. \nIt would have nice been if they had said that humans with certain personality traits, morals and life philosophies that aren't common or strays from the norm have a higher chance of becoming a Shiki because of X and Y reasons. That's would be more grounded and it also makes you think what kind of person are these characters really underneath all the surface level social interactions and obligations, but no we couldn't have depth or good writing. when you take away the creep factor and the horror element this series dose feel like twilight the animation.\n\nCharacters: 6/10\nThere are three Main Characters in this series, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to talk about each of them separately, rather than as a group. First main character, Natsuno Yuuki is this emo/loner teenager with a heart of gold, something I initially found slightly interesting and out of the main cast I could relate to him the most in some ways, but which disappointed me all the more, when he turned out to be, by far the weakest link out of all the series\u00e2\u0080\u0099 mains. Even though he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most certainly better written than your usual highschool protagonist, outside of that, he isn't really that interesting, because of his lackluster handling. To add insult to injury, after 11 episode they kinda drop the ball on him and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give him the screen time he deserves afterwards, even though he continues throughout the story to play a big role. it like they didn't know what to do with his character so they decided to push him to the sidelines and also out of the main characters he is the one that gets the least development and fleshing out. he pretty much treated like background character after a certain point and I didn't really like it. Considering he had some potential because of what type of person he is and what happens to him in the series. but in practice, this potential wasn't fully realized.\n\nSecond main character Toshio Ozaki Who is very determined and serious about this job as the local doctor, as he will go through whatever it takes to make sure his patients are safe and healthy. even if he sometimes he comes of as rough around the edges And throughout the events of the series he goes through so much pain and turmoil because for once in his life he doesn't have the answers and he can't do anything to stop these mysterious deaths and the vampires behind it. In fact his inability to stop these mysterious deaths pushes him to the braking point of where the lines of human/inhuman really start to blur for him as a person Which was very interesting and asks the question for his character how far is he willing to go to protect the villagers at the cost of his own humanity. Which he learns the hard way and has to live with his actions for the rest of his days as he almost loses everything in his blind pursuit of justice which I find quite funny in a very tragic and ironic way because a doctor duty was to protect and save lives but now you have a doctor who is now destroying and taking the (un)lives of the former villagers he once tried to protect.\n\nNow the last main character seishin Muroi who is the local priest and on off writer in the village. Who on outside seems like a pretty calm and well-natured guy basically he like the total opposite of the dr Ozaki. but underneath this calm exterior lies is a very deep rooted hatred for the village that has made him and his father life miserable because of the roles there were assigned to in their local community without any choice or anyway to escape from it and he also a person with a very bleak outlook on life which was created by his environment,Which probably makes him one of the more interesting characters in the series and also goes through some pretty nice development and fleshing out which was pushed along with his friendship with Sunako, who is probably one of few individuals that truly understands him . This relationship and the dr actions eventually leads to him having an a ultimatum forced upon him, He can give up his morals and save the village that he Hates or keep to his morals and pursue his only chance at freedom. Of course I am not going to tell you what choice he picked but his inner conflict to reach a conclusion was very interesting to watch and also does well from a thematic standpoint as one of the series other themes is how human society places roles on people and expect people to stick to those roles whether you want to or not. \n\nSo when it comes to side characters. I feel this series sufferers from the same issue that Tokyo ghoul had where they have a lot of characters with personalities and etc but not enough time is focused on them for character fleshing out or character development, and it doesn't really help when most of the supporting cast feels very distant and it hard to feel invested emotionally,especially when the horror element of the series is banking so much for you to care about these characters. why should i feel bad or care about characters that i don't really know. the only few characters i cared about was toru who becomes consumed with guilt after murdering his best friend who tried to help him or Ritsuko the local nurse who goes out of her way not to feed on anyone because she would rather die than willingly bring harm others so she could live and these characters are the most human and some of the more realistic characters in the series. But the other shiki didn't really consider the consequences of their actions until it was to late, like for example Megumi who like many of the characters were strong armed into becoming shiki yet she takes the whole vampire thing way too far. Like I understand that she has to drink blood to live and she kinda a bitch but does she really need to start enjoy killing people which also included her former loved ones like some demented sadist. I understand there was more introspection in the original source for her character, but it sure as hell isn't in this anime and I think it was quite needed. It would have been interesting to see considering what she becomes. Because there still things she cares about like her one-sided love/obsession with Natsuno, which showcases she's isn't just a heartless monster she just kinda a bitch.\n\nLast thing I want to talk about is the kinda the main villain Sunako. Who isn't exactly evil per say she more like an anti-villain because nothing in her personality or actions really scream evil to me.The goal of having a vampire village so her kind could have a place to call home and not be threatened by humans is quite a noble goal and I am pretty sure lots of people would do the same if being put in her shoes and the humanity still with her is more fleshed out with her relationship and interaction with seishin. But the problem is that even though she lived for about 100+ she has the mental capacity and foresight of a small child and doesn't really understand what exactly she putting people through to reach those goals she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s similar to Peter Pan in that respect because she the girl that never truly grew up, And That's her character in a nutshell. she doesn't truly understand or feel anything for the victims of her actions because at this point her psychology is so alien and disconnected from humanity. but what I dislike is how they're trying to make her overly cute to make her seem more innocent than she actually is and It almost feels at times that they're trying to manipulate your emotions, When It comes to her character as a whole with this very dishonest presentation of her character.\n\nArt:7/10\nThe animation is pretty decent and maintains a very consistent level of quality. Unfortunately, the backgrounds that match it leave a lot to be desired. One of the series\u00e2\u0080\u0099 greatest strengths is the way it occasionally changes the color scheme for certain scenes of tension to create an atmosphere that benefits them. This is by far the most effective visual element the show implements, as it adds a lot more energy to the series as a whole, which also helps you get through some of the slower parts. The artstyle is fine, but I think it's a bit too cartoony and over the top at times with the character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expressions, which conflicts with the series\u00e2\u0080\u0099 dark and ominous tone. The artstyle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s greatest sin though is in the character designs. While not bad on their own, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re probably the worst thing they could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve picked for this show. I mean neon pink hair, purple eyes and hairstyles that look straight out of the 80s aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly the best thing for a horror show. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not even joking when I say there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a character that looks like he has cat ears, making him perfect husbando material, but simultaneously impossible to take seriously. Details like this make the show lose all credibility as a serious show and instead make it look extremely silly and jarring. \n\nSound: 7/10\nFirst off, the opening songs are alright to listen to on their own, but their pop and rock style doesn't really fit the type show that Shiki is. Even though the lyrics fit the series well, that still doesn't fix the fact that the openings don't fit the tone the series is going for. The ending songs while not really the type of music I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m more partial towards, fit the series way better because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re more depressing and ominous tone. One notable nitpick is that the opening\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visuals spoil some major plot points, through painfully obvious symbolism. This is unfortunate as it serves to kill a lot of the tension and suspense that is crucial to such a show dead. The ost by Yasuharu Takanashi, who also worked on Fairy Tail, Naruto Shippuden and Sailor Moon Crystal is pretty decent both as a stand-alone and in context. It more often than not, does an incredible job at building up this creepy, eerie and dare I say subtle atmosphere that the show desperately needs. As a matter of fact, I had a member of my family listen to it and she said that it reminds her a lot of the atmosphere that permeates throughout the main body of acclaimed author Stephen King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s novels.\nSub and dub were alright I didn't really have any complaints about it.\n\n\nEnjoyment: 6/10\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a big fan of more or less anything with vampires, social commentary, gray mortality and massive amounts of gore, so needless to say Shiki was right up my alley, despite the fact that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen series execute the same ideas it brings up better. Besides its basic element that appeal to me though, the ending 4-6 episodes contain some of the best unintentional comedy moments I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in quite some time. This for the most part, but not exclusively because it just somehow turns into a massive bloodbath, including a huge forest fire, people going on massive paranoia induced freak outs and acts of brutality and cruelty that rival Phantom Blood in that special hammy goodness that we all know and love. Thanks to these final episodes, I was stuck smiling with glee as the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cast would turn on each other like wild animals.\n\nOverall: 6/10\nShiki is a very mixed bag for me. As a horror series, it's pretty standard for anime in how much it underplays the strengths of the genre. As a thought piece that delves into the diverse and opposing perspectives of the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cast for the purpose of blurring the lines of the common perception of morality, it only does so to a rather shallow degree. This is mostly due to the hamfisted nature of the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drama, that mostly just comes across as overplayed and pointless, with only the main characters and a few of the side characters aiding in stopping the whole thing from completely falling apart. If you're the type of person that doesn't like senseless gore and the comically pretentious execution of relevant moral dilemmas then you probably shouldn't watch this show. Nevertheless, as far as series with vampires go, Shiki isn't that bad relative to what other series have done with them and even though I have been quite negative about it, I feel that shiki is a fun ride and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a good time waster.\n\nSpecial thanks to my paid in Yugioh cards and slightly pissed editor, Lonecrit for his help on this project."}, {"id": 3041, "score": 51, "body": "Warning this review may contain spoilers.\n\nFirst impressions, so I guess I am back again to review my favorite trainwreck series but now in movie format yyyyyyyyyyyyyyy. Let's just get this shit show rolling.\n\nStory: 4/10\nThe film starts with our Lord and savior Kirito-sama joyfully reaping the benefits of his labors after the defeat of Death Gun, the reclaiming of the sword Excalibur and getting family permission to fuck asuna in real life. While kirito has been busy enjoying his day to day life. a new game has taken the world by a storm named Ordinal Scale a game that mergers the real-life world with virtual reality technology. Kirito who been living under a rock lately knows nothing about this new game until asuna and the harem club tell him about it and convince him to join in on the fun. As kirito and friends join in on this new fad they soon learn that things are not as they appear with odd accidents are happening to Sao players and an even more mysterious ghost-like girl who is appearing in front of kirito. Now the scales of destiny have started tipping and it time for Kirito to do what he does best solve video game related mysteries.\nSo sword art online ordinal was hyped to be sword art online redemption to the mainstream crowd who have been arguably cynical about this franchise.\nBy fixing the problems that I myself and quite a few people have about the series as a whole and with the added bonus apparently focusing more on kirito and asuna relationship. And I be honest when I first heard that's what they were Promising I didn't really have high hopes because Star Wars online pretty much destroyed any sense of hope in me that sword art online would be considered quote-unquote good. But despite my cynicism life seems to still surprise me because this movie by in large actually delivered on what it actually promised people. Like for example kirito not being overpowered and actually focusing on kirito and Asuna relationship. Which in that regard I feel it did an ok job at that which I will go into more detail later. But other than that regard I do feel that the storyline and plot was a little underwhelming and lackluster, to say the least. The basic story and plot are basically about this dude who using the game ordinal scale to gather the memories or PTSD from the sword art online players in order to bring back his dead girlfriend Yuna as an A.I. And even if I find this idea of people using technology to download themselves Onto a computer to keep themselves alive interesting and it also kinda hints there some sort techno afterlife that's going on in the background. But The main plot falls apart when you think about how exactly is other people memories and experiences of sword art online going to bring your girlfriend back to life exactly. Even if she in this a.l data format it still wouldn't work because those aren't her memories or her experiences and even if she had interaction with some of the people that they stole memories and experiences from it still wouldn't work because it, not her memories or experiences it's someone else point of view Not hers so the reasoning is pure grade bullshit. Now the kirito and Asuna relationship thing and kirito being less overpower which was quite hyped until this movie release I feel that it was a little overrated and didn't really amount to much in the grand scheme of things. Like Asuna loosening her memories and experiences from sword art online would make an interesting catalyst to test the waters of kirito and Asuna relationship because of that where they fell in love and I feel that conflict has enough emotional payoff for you to care slightly about what is going on. But at the same time, I kinda feel That it's a little overdramatized and doesn't really have much of a conflict with it. Kirito and Asuna aren't going to break up or are going through this rough stage of their relationship because of this memory loss issue The only conflict is that maybe this memory loss thing may get worse and spread to more parts of her memories. this is where feel they fucked up because what they should have done is made her lose all her memories of kirito and the rest of that conflict was kirito trying to keep their relationship together and it would have made his quest to get her memories back by becoming the top player of ordinal scale more impactful as the way they present it in the movie is very cringe-worthy at to say the least as there are scenes where kirito is playing and acting like a complete crazy man Because as well know video games are serious business, and if you don't take them seriously you are a newb that won't get good at games or get the girls. But besides that story wise there isn't much majorly wrong with it besides those things I mentioned.\nOf course, other small nit pics I have are that the info dumps are fucking mind-numbingly boring that I would prefer to watch paint dry as these infodump scenes slow down the pacing and the fact there is multiple info dumps scene in a two-hour-ish movie just showcases how shit the writing. Also after all the shit that people went through with the sword art online and dart gun incidents, You would think that the government at this point would keep an eye on new technology that involved video games. Because guess what this new device that people use to play ordinal scale can kill you wohhhhhhh mind fucking blown and the only reason why there were no deaths is because kirito and the government stopped it before it reached that point.\n\nCharacters, 5/10\nKirito is his usual self-insert self. But this time he actually has more of a personality, And for once we actually see him struggle for a bit with a conflict that is out of his control and he actually has to try really hard to get what he wants. Like it just shows that even if he quite strong and intelligent there still things that he can't beat alone without him giving it his all. Which is nice to see but it does really amount to anything and it's just another example of sword art online classic wasted potential moments.\n\nAnother thing I want to address is Asuna is more relevant and actually shows the combat skills that made her this vice commander of the Knights of blood oath in the first place. In fact she actually a little stronger than kirito in ordinal scale and she actually even kicks quite a bit of ass. Which I liked and even after the memory loss thing they still treat her character with respect and not just some damsel in distress that needs to be saved all the time by our lord and saviour kirito Which I also like and I feel she was handled a lot better in this movie than the rape fairy arc or all of season two. Also before I move onto the side characters, I want to talk about Yuna quickly. And I like what she brings to the table it just to me she isn't that interesting and I didn't really give a shit about her anyway because I have no reason to care. So The Side characters The usual crew is back again nothing much has really changed. Except like Asuna there all made more relevant and actually do something instead of being fodder or mouthpieces until kirito shows up to rekt shit. Like they all showcase their abilities as well and it nice they have a role and do it well, Like at the end there this one scene where they all fighting this massive boss monster and they all work together to kill it and during that fight, they used teamwork and even saved each other a few times from video game death Which was nice to have. So the main villain or should I say man villains are a massive step up form. I don't know why I did this guy, rape fairly and darth gun. Eiji the dude who getting the memories for bringing his girlfriend back. His reasoning is understandable and even though he does questionable things to reach that goal. He not evil and a bad guy he just wants his girlfriend back and even if that kinda simple and basic it's a lot better than rapey dude. And the other villain Dr. Shigemura. He basically a dude full of guilt because he blames himself for his daughter Yuma death in sword art online because he brought her the nerve gear thing for her birthday which lead to her death. And even he is understandable and not exactly an evil person he wants to bring his daughter back to life even if he has to harm others and even if he is also basic and simple it's still 100x better than rape guy.\n\nArt, 8/10\nThe animation is god tier and it looks like it was animated by the gods. The background is so clean and crip that would want to make a wallpaper out of it. There also really good CGI that doesn't clash with the animation. the fight scenes are really good and even if I find them a little too flashy for my liking. It still looks pretty cool to watch and some decent fight choreography as well, with people using teamwork or fets of combat prowess. I am not exactly a big fan of there new VR form character designs because they don't have much of a personality to them anymore and I kinda which they did. Because gun gale form had more personality to them and they looked cool because it reminded me of fallout.\n\nSound: 8/10\nThe ost, by Yuki Kajiura, was fucking amazing as always and easily one of the redeeming aspects of this movie. Even by the standard, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s set in the past though, I was astonished to see how above and beyond she went with the quality of the soundtrack this time around. My favorite piece of this movie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ost was probably delete, an extremely divine sounding track, making the contents of the movie feel a lot grander. It was also extremely pleasant to see that a few old favourites were revived for this movie, such as swordland All in all, ordinal scale has a lot of outstanding tracks that are amazing to listen too and do an excellent job of making the movie they go with feel like it has some weight to it, despite the actual narrative contents.\n\nEnjoyment: 6/10\nThe bare-bones story and lacking characters, unfortunately, prevented me from getting really invested in the vision that this movie was trying to realize, but nevertheless, it at least gets a cookie for presentation. I really enjoyed this movie and I would recommend it to anyone who just wants a nice action movie to watch. SAO as a whole is never lacking in the spectacle department and this movie definitely brings it. The fight scenes, in combination ost, especially make for some excellent popcorn material, but other than that nothing really got my interest.\n\nOverall: 5/10\n\nConclusion:\nWas this the big redemption for the franchise that it was hyped up to be? Well yes and no. A lot of the series\u00e2\u0080\u0099 has had in the past major problems were taken away, but I still feel like this movie was pretty bare bones and underwhelming considering what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been done in this franchise before. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s certainly a step in the right direction and if they keep this up then maybe sword art online won't be such a meme in future. But a step in the right direction doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t equate to a good end-product and I don't have high hopes for season 3, but who knows, this series may shock me once again.\nSpecial thanks to my pain in yu-gi-oh cards editor, Lonecrit."}, {"id": 3045, "score": 63, "body": "Warming this review may contain spoilers.\n\nFirst impressions, ok to be completely honest I only originally checked out this show because it had a trap it in and I liked all the memes that where coming from this series was what originally got my interest, but of course once I started watching it there was a lot more than to the series than I first thought.\n(Also quick Side note i will be covering both seasons of the anime in this review)\n\nStory, 6/10 \nSo in today's modern anime where half the series that are coming out are about ether about high schools or cute girls doing cute things how dose a series My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU stand out in a market which at this point has already reached peak inflation, besides being about a bitter, anti-social teenager named Hachiman forced into a school club called service club, the that help people fix their problems, totally haven't heard about this before a seruies about a high school student being forced into an excuse for plot club with cute girls and sarcasm aside.\nThe story is basically the three of them trying to fix poor, poor Japanese high school students problems and there some sort of love triangle forming because light novel. which at first thought I figured this is just going to be another generic school romantic comedy that I would forget in a week, and considering my experience with the medium you can't exactly blame me for having that viewpoint.\nBut i was very surprised in how even though this series is mostly about high school bullshit, i did find it interesting that this series actually talks and criticiszes human society. Well to be more specific it's more aless socal commenty and the problems that can arise which i find very interesting and the fact this series trys to more thought provoking than your average romantic school comady with teenagers is really impressive to say the least.\nThe ideas of don't always go with the crowd, be yourself and some people are going to be two-faced assholes. the fact it doesn't devolve into otaku culture to get it point across just adds weight to the commentary because whoever wrote this dose has this understanding of how people tick and doesn't use it for an excuse for edgelord bullshit, but more a less is telling you this is normal human behaviour and it isn't perfect, but that's fine because even if problems do come up there are ways to fix them to get around them. \n\nBut the major prolem is even though it's a lot more thought provoking and actually trys to be interesting with its messages and etc, it is sadly constrained by the fact that at the end of the day it is still a teen romantic comedy in high school and you can only take it so far intill it implodes on itself, and another prolem I have with this series is that it has this meta commentary asspect where its makeing fun of the tropes and cliches of its genre, but also realays on sied tropes and cliches for its plot beat.\nSo comes off more like its mocking itself rather than any meaningful commentary on the subject and I for one hate that kind of humour in anime with a passion because it just isn't funny. When Hachiman is being an asshole that's when I find the series funny because I find his brand of no fucks given just comedy gold and this meta humour or references to other series just feels very forced. \n\nSpeaking of forced the love triangle in this series between Hachiman, Yukino and Yui is the most forced thing In this series, because even though I find the \"friendship\" they forms together really sweet and endearing. But at the same time, I feel the romantic dynamic to there relationship feels tacked on for the sack of waifu wars or stretching out the story longer than it has to.\n\n\nCharacters, 6/10 \nWhen it comes to main charter Hachiman, he is a breath of fresh ear if you are used to the generic Japanese high schooler template that may series use nowadays. Becuase What makes Hachiman so great as a character is that he has a personality that you can define and isn't a just a blank self-insert.\nHe is this cynical, anti-social asshole that just doesn't give a fuck, and what him really interesting as a character is that despite the zero fucks personality. There is a part of him that does care for people, it's just most people misunderstand his intentions. Becuase Hachiman is basically an anti-hero in a way because he is willing to shower the burdens of being hated in order to shit done.\nI feel as far as teenage characters go Hachiman is very feel written for what he is, at times he feels almost human in a way instead of being this cardboard cutout.\n\nWhen it comes to the other members of the service club Yukino and Yui.\nEven though their personality is kinda standard fare, there is a lot more depth added to them and a lot more thought put into them so they come off charming than anything else. But besides that there not really that memorable when compared to Hachiman.\n\nSide characters are in the same boat as Yukino and Yui but worse.\nTheir personalities are really watered down even if there is a tad bit of depth to them. I don't remember their names and I will forget they even exist within a week because I found them so boring. \n\nNow I will say that the dialogue and interactions between the charters are a lot more intriguing than the actual charters themselves. Because this series likes to dive into social interactions into more depth and thought than most series of its genre. For an example, there is a scene where characters could seem happy on the outside, but inside there really angry and are dropping this passive aggressive comments. Which I liked.\n\n\n\nArt, 6/10\nThe animation runs quite smoothly and the art keeps up a decent quality,\nBut background looks like they were painted on at times. Of course, the second season lessens these issues I have to a degree with everything looking a lot more polished and slighty more detailed.\nArt style is basic and the character designs are pretty standard fare, but I will say that the main charter little sister would look really great in some doujins though.\n\n\n\nSound, 5/10 \n\nThe first oping song was pretty good, but everything else hoping and ending wise was kinda lacklustre at best. There nice to listen to i guess but they didnt really get my interest. The ost was done my some japanese music studio named MoNaca who have some very fumous people under them like for example keiichi okabe, satoru kosaki and kakeru ishihama who from who i can gather so far was the main dude behind the ost for this series. Its not that bad of an ost to listain its just nothing really got my interest and make me feel like woh i need to download this and listain to it over and over again.\n\n\nEnjoyment, 6/10\n\nSo when it comes to enjoyment, i enjoyed this seruies for what it was and i have even got 10 volumes of the light novel. I think what really got me into this series it that it actually tries to provide some sort of thought-provoking content, which is very impressive for a series that is about high school bullshit.\n\n\n\nOverall, 6/10\nIf you like romantic comedies I would say that my romantic comedy snafu is worth at least checking out, because it tries a lot harder than most of its genre. Which I think the effort alone should be prised to some degree But that doesn't mean it is the masterpiece that some people would claim it to be.\nBecause it is highly limited in what it can do because of the high school setting, if its setting was in college or maybe the Japanese workplace it would properly have a lot more impact in its social commentary and it could talk about more things."}, {"id": 3046, "score": 62, "body": "Warning: This review contains spoilers.\n\nFirst impressions: When I first heard about this series I had very mixed feelings about it. For starters, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s based on an erotic visual novel, at the same time though it's also a free-for-all battle series, complete with mages and historical figures fighting each other to the death over a magical all purpose macguffin. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSounded right up my alley\u00e2\u0080\u009d I thought and this series became my gateway to Type-Moon, which has provided me with tons of entertainment and has become one of my favourite franchises, in part due to me being an amateur history buff. Plus, I think the whole idea of the Fate franchise is a very novel idea, which as of yet, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to have grown the least bit bored of.\n\n\nStory: 6/10\nThe story of this anime is an adaptation of the Fate route from the Fate/Stay Night visual novel, which is probably my least favourite route for various reasons which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get into later. As far as battle shounen titles go, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say this one is in general a pretty decent one. Not only does it deliver on cool fights, but it also provides a slightly interesting, albeit shallow commentary on morality for the uninitiated. It explores the different ethical viewpoints of its characters while they're going through the holy grail war. The major problem though is that this series tries to have its cake and eat it too by juggling a serious death battle with slice of life and pseudo-harem elements, making it that much more jarring when any serious plot elements come into play. Case and point, despite the fact that Emiya is kidnapped, or even nearly killed multiple times while either at school or doing mundane things around town, as if the fact that there are people out there trying to kill him is completely a non-issue, serving to both make the show look tonally inconsistent and him look very very stupid. Even worse, quite a few of the masters who lost their servants during the war end up taking residence in his house. Including ones that tried to kill him before, who are still a potential threat. This is completely hand-waved in favour of playing out various slice of life romantic scenarios. As a result of this tonal whiplash, I stopped taking anything in the series seriously and decided to enjoy the ride for what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth. Unfortunately, to me, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not much, as the route the anime covers is pretty vanilla when compared to the visual novel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other routes. The anime just gives you the basics of what you need to know about the series, while leaving a lot of things so deprived of detail that the provided world and characters end up, as a whole feeling very sterile. Plus in all honesty, the plot twists in this series are iffy at best, not to mention predictable if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve any experience with any kind of stories that feature magic or objects that grant wishes. For example, the plot twist concerning the true nature of the holy grail isn't really that shocking when you consider that so far no one has won the holy grail and made a wish with it. The only reason the Fate route is even remotely worthwhile is due to the interest it builds for the franchise as a whole. That, and the route\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character of focus, Saber and her fascinating internal conflict in deciding whether to make her wish and redo the past or accept the past and live a normal life with Shiro. Although I feel the romance that happens between them is somewhat forced in some regards, I still find it cute and enjoyable.\n\nCharacters: 6/10\nMain character Shirou Emiya is probably this series\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weakest point. At first glance he seems to be a one-note character, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s selfless nature compels him to become a just hero, to the point that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s willing to risk his life to protect people with no concern for his own safety, and no amount of additional glances will change that perception. Minor cynicism aside though, his major problem is his bare bones characterisation, a problem that could be supplemented with some internal monologue, but he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any of that. This is quite the missed opportunity too, as in the visual novel he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s significantly more layered than what one would initially think, specifically because he has that one factor going for him. Additionally, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s held back character-wise by the fact that there aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t many tests of his character, which if existent, would allow his character to bloom into something a little more reminiscent of a human being. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because of this lack of trails to overcome and grow from that his outlook isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really validated in any meaningful sense, making him mostly just come across of the same naive, ignorant kid he was in the beginning.\n\nSaber, the heroine of this route thankfully has at least a little depth to her Character, at least when compared to Shiro. The clash between her stoic warrior side and her feminine side, which comes out increasingly more due to her growing bond with Shiro is quite interesting, Unfortunately, she mostly just comes across as a plank of wood that only deals in extremes, taking away greatly from that aspect of her character. To emphasize my point, early on in the series there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a scene where Shiro walks in on her in the shower and she doesn't care, as she feels that any particular emotion being inspired over such a thing unreasonable, but later into the series, during a very similar scene, she get extremely self-conscious, mainly due to her awareness of her physical appearance, to the point where she comes across as an entirely different character. What that tells me is that to properly function as a warrior and as a leader she had to sacrifice her femininity, mind, body and soul. A very interesting concept, as it shows both the strength of her resolve and the crippling effects of the momentous weight that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been placed on her shoulders during her whole life. I will say though, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m kinda bothered by the fact that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s King Arthur turned female, as I think that that idea, while interesting, is rather problematic, due to seemingly being done more for fan service more than anything else. Because this is based on a what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essentially a porn game, there have to be sex scenes, therefore there has to be a female lead, otherwise I think it would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ended up alienating most of the main demographic or anyone who would even bother with watching it, unless saber was a Trap.\n\nThe side characters are a really mixed bag. Most of the ones that aren't Shiro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s school friends are either one-note or multi-layered. This route is, in general, very good at characterising its cast in a very subtle show, don't tell way. Caster for example, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at first built up as just an evil witch, is later on showcased as having various different sides to her in a very subdued, natural way. For example, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a scene in which she and her master get backed into a corner by Shiro and friends, only for another heroic spirit to enter the battle and try to kill her master. It is then that she chooses to stand in the way of the attack, and die as a result. Its actions like this that some the cast have some semblance of depth, as well as add a very interesting theme, that of morality being in the eye of the observer. Even though quite a few of the cast members are supposedly evil, or commit evil actions, they are proven time and time again to have the capacity act in selfless, and in some cases even honourable ways. Thanks to this, the show manages to create very nuanced take on morally. Unfortunately, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still the odd characters that are so inhumanely evil that you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bring yourself to care about them beyond the way in which one care about a funny joke, like Shiji. Alternatively, there also characters that are so blandly good people that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re entirely lacking in flavour, who only exist to either provide some sense of normalcy or information on what the average Joe thinks is going on in the city, like Taiga.\n\nArt/Animation: 5/10\nConsidering the time this came out, the art and animation are more or less passable, maybe even above average, excluding the god-awful CGI dragon scene, which to be honest looks like it was rendered using a PS1. Although, when compared to other series like Death Note or Ergo Proxy, which look astronomically better, despite coming out during the same year. Hell, even when compared to a lot of 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anime, like Trigun or Cowboy Bebop, Fate/Stay Night doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even come close to competing, something which is very telling of where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at on the totem pole. All in all, the production values aren't exactly great and definitely haven't aged well either, which I feel is the reason why quite a few people don't watch this series. This is a major problem, because it also affects how the battles look and play out. The fights often feel stiff as a corpse and to add insult to the injury, most of them are the characters just talking. This means that the entirety of a lot of confrontations is a sleep inducing few minutes of a clunky mess, preceded by an only slightly less sleep inducing dialogue. But hey, on the bright side, who needs Ambien? On a more seriously positive note though, I actually do really like the stylishly anime character designs a lot, especially in regard to how Lancer, Caster and Assassin look and feel.\n\nSound: 6/10\nDespite how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been doing so far, this series at least somewhat excels in the sound department. The first and second openings are decent enough and help capture the epic feeling that goes hand in hand with the content. Unfortunately, the ending songs aren't really that noticeable or memorable, even if they fit the series well. The OST was done by Kenji Kawai, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worked on other series like Higurashi, Barakamon and Ghost in the Shell, among many others, so one would expect nothing less than quality from someone with such works on their profile. Unfortunately though, while on point in most scenes, is way too subdued for its own good and doesn't build on series\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strengths. One could argue that the more subdued nature of the soundtrack helps capture and amplify the emotions and feels of the characters, who in there lives have come to shoulder many burdens and regrets, in particular their heroic spirits. Now in that regard, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give it points for adding some sort of  narrative subtlety. However, I feel a more epic sounding one, like for Unlimited Blade Works or even Heaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Feel would fit this series better, given that the material it goes with is essentially about mages and fantasy heroes of old duking it out. The sub and dub are both passable, with both the versions\u00e2\u0080\u0099 voice acting teams doing quite a good job with what they had to work with and more than successfully capturing the personality of the characters they were playing.\n\nEnjoyment: 6/10\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m an amateur history buff, and therefore quite enjoy learning about history, I found the pseudo-historical element of this series to be very interesting. Additionally, the idea that history isn't exactly as it is written, which especially evident with the characters of Caster, Rider and Saber in particular added quite a lot of extra appeal for me, something which Fate/Stay Night managed to do a really good job of capitalizing on. Although the flip-side of this is that for the history you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re presented with, you have to have an open mind and take everything with a pretty hefty grain of salt. The fights were also quite enjoyable, because of the philosophical perspectives expressed by characters during them, lending them some much needed engagement and impact. This is because these additional aspects serve to make the fights, not just over glorified sword and club fights, but rather broader reaching ideological conflicts. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thanks to the aforementioned that Fate/Stay Night was, enjoyment wise at least pretty much love at first site.\n\nOverall: 6/10\nAs far as battle royale series go, Fate/Stay Night is pretty decent overall. Unfortunately, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as deep as some would make it out to be, due to the fact that the route this anime covers is the fate route, which I said before is kinda the barebones vanilla route of the set. It only show the bare basics and doesn't really shine on its own, unless you really like the character of saber. As an introduction to the franchise and Type-Moon in general though, this series does a very good job of selling on it, even if the production values leave just a little more than a little to be desired. However, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for more depth or generally something more extreme you're better off watching the Unlimited Blade Works and Heaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Feel adaptations, which are in all honestly are the peaks of this entire franchise. Specially since they are not only way more interesting in story and characters than Fate/Stay Night, but also feature a god tier OST and animation, not to mention being very pleasing on the eyes. \n\n\nSpecial thanks to my paid in Yu-Gi-Oh cards editor Lonecrit.\n"}, {"id": 3054, "score": 60, "body": "I can't say I'm too well-versed when it comes to the mafia. My knowledge primarily stems from popular culture, which I'm sure glamorizes some aspects and trivializes others. However, I'm confident that the most vital element in the mafia is the concept of trust. When you're doing illegal activities, for your own sake or for someone else's, a traitor can easily collapse an insurmountable amount of hard work. The mafia in Gungrave are no exception. The members of Millennion, the mafia that rules the underground activities of the city Billion, are all bound by the \"Code of Iron\". This code has a simple definition - never betray lest you be killed. Simple in theory, but in practice, the message can be blurred or disobeyed when members feel they are above the code. Gungrave, for better or for worse, documents these decisions in a tale that tackles trust, friendship, freedom and family over the course of 26 episodes.\n\nThe hardest part of reviewing Gungrave stems from its first episode. Unlike some introductions, where they tease what's to come or try to hint at the protagonist's success, Gungrave flat out tells the viewer of many spoilers of what happens and can ruin the buildup of key plot points. For this review, I will be pretending this first episode doesn't exist so as to avoid any \"spoilers\". I suggest new viewers to do the same until they reach Episode 18.\n\nGungrave documents two young men, Harry MacDowel and Brandon Heat, as they rise from the dirty slums of Billion City through the ranks of Millennion. While Harry's goal is to obtain a Robin Hood like freedom, being able to take and give away as much as he wants, Brandon is along initially for support and for the chance to see his crush, Maria, more often. These roles are reflected in their personalities, with Harry being a charismatic individual while Brandon is a quiet, near mute figure. It can be a bit worrisome when a character is silent a majority of the time in a work, as they can feel more like a \"blank canvas\" than an actual character. Fortunately, Brandon's actions do a far better job voicing his feelings. His loyalty to Millennion is shown early on by accomplishing unpleasant internal affairs as well as risking his life as a sweeper more often than most in the business. Harry and Brandon play off of each other as you'd expect good friends to and their opposite behaviors form a nice contrast that makes them great to watch.\n\nOf course, the other characters of the story are no small fry either. Initially, the characters of Millennion show interesting and human characteristics that make the story feel more real. Big Daddy, the leader of Millennion, is not a scary power-fueled boss as much as a guy who started the organization to protect the ones he cares about (the irony is dampened when Millennion's trust is put in focus). Bunji Kugashira is a lone wolf \"assassin for hire\" who thinks he's above all else in talent, but finds respect in Brandon's abilities and even looks up to him as a older brother. It's true that we don't go too in detail for the supporting cast - after all, this is Brandon and Harry's story - but I did enjoy the early company of these characters just as much as the main characters and was excited to learn more with each episode. \n\nThese character moments aren't just pleasant to watch - they are important for Brandon and Harry. They learn from others what the mafia business is really like and they learn the strengths and weaknesses of each individual working in it. It becomes quite clear that an organization is only as strong as the people who make it up. When underhanded deals and betrayals are made, the impact can not only affect the others in the business but also the ones behind it. Gungrave makes it clear that it isn't a happy story and even when the \"right call\" is made, it can often lead to the despair or downfall of another person. These moments are when the show is the most powerful and interesting. It's not so much a feeling of anguish or sadness as much as it is that of solemn behavior. There's no time to grieve - the show and business must go on.\n\nUnfortunately, Gungrave runs into a dilemma in its story that can either make or break the anime to some. Gungrave's main focus is a serious mafia story but it also dabbles in science fiction. A key element of the show is found in the process of \"Necrolyzation\", a term meaning to bring back those from the dead into strong zombie-men that have high defenses. Like the struggles within Millennion, the show struggles to maintain its story and characters as more of these concepts leak in. I felt that the characters became more \"one-note\" and lost some of their appeal during the second half of the show and the zombie technology and transformations (\"Orgmen\") became a bit ridiculous. I could see some people feeling the show was a bit dry and this was a way for it to carve its own identity versus other stories, but I really enjoyed the non sci-fi elements of the show the most. At the very least, the pacing is kept up and the episodes are still enjoyable to watch, even when the show becomes a \"Orgmen of the week\" series.\n\nAnother big flaw of Gungrave stems from its animation. I usually am more forgiving towards a series if the animation and pacing are good - it gets me immersed and ready for action! Sadly, Madhouse does a B-grade job when it comes to Gungrave's animation. Some fights during the second half are pretty clean and the use of shading is nice but the lack of fluidity and occasionally awkward drawing can hurt the series more than it should. It's not bad enough to be laughable but it sure isn't the best that Madhouse has done. The music for the show is a bit of an odd one to discuss. I never really felt a strong emotion or power from it - it acted more like a \"texture\" to a scene, trying to enhance it without being noticed (sad violin, expressive guitar, forlorn horn). They don't really work standalone either - I suppose Tsuneo Imahori (who did the music for the series) just wanted it to be support and nothing more. The voice actors do a real good job. They convey emotion well and are very expressive. Major props go to Ryuuzaburou Ootomo for Bear Walken's bass voice and the flamboyant Takehito Koyasu who does the voice of Balladbird Lee.\n\nAn interesting aspect of Gungrave comes from the fact that Madhouse adapted it from a video game, rather than a manga or light novel like usual adaptations. The Gungrave video game, funnily enough, scored only middling reviews and was praised most for its character designs by Yasuhiro Nightow (of Trigun fame). A glance through some of the gameplay mechanics shows this game is more combat heavy and features even stranger twists than what's shown in the anime. I suppose that director Toshiyuki Tsuru wanted to focus more on the story and character interactions - a smart move considering you can't play an anime.\n\nOverall, I give Gungrave a 6.0 out of 10. It's an addictive and fun show to watch, but I wish it was a bit more down-to-earth overall instead of trying to be a strange sci-fi thriller. However, I may be in the minority - if a mafia tale with a twist sounds like your thing, you should definitely check this one out! \n\nDo you like or dislike this anime?

It is something that really wanted to do more than it had the episodes to do, and therefor suffers a fair bit. Character development that had major effects on motivations and repercussions on characters, gets shoved into a 20 minute period that you end up not really caring about. While the story itself is fairly basic and easy to understand, overcome personal challenges and pilot big mech to defeat aliens while suffering at points along the way and in the end win the war.\n\nThe characters are the largest casualties of the short 6 episode run time Gunbusters was given. Character arcs and development end up being forced into 10-20 minute segments in an episode. And feels really awkward at times with how quickly characters change in their beliefs and grow. You end up with characters like Smith, who gets 1 episode and has repercussions for another episode. But during this time I kept getting the idea that Noriko and Smith were supposed to have spend weeks together and even might have developed some feelings for each other, but that was never shown or given any time. Or Jung, who goes from somebody who dislikes Noriko and Kazumi and has this rivalry with them at the beginning of the episode, to having a decent friendly relationship with them by the end of the episode. But then will suddenly have moments when the rivalry shows up again randomly, for seemingly no reason for one scene. And then goes back to being good friends and hanging out with them, it just makes her character feel very disjointed. At one point it seemed like they wanted a conflict to develop between Kazumi and Noriko over how much time Noriko was spending with Coach, based around Kazumi being jealous of how attention Coach has always given Noriko. But it lasted about 10 minutes and was resolved without any issue. \n\nI did like the artwork and animation throughout the show, and thought it looked pretty good. At times you could see the shots they reused from other episodes, or issues were they forgot to finish drawing a scene. But never once did I think it looked bad, it just looked fairly good. Episode 6 also had a rather unique style that got used so they could finish the show the way they wanted to. When it kinda turned into a slideshow of single shots of various fights and events occurring throughout the final push, and did a really good job of showing the fight without actually animating everything. \n\nThe story I feel wasn't all that special, but was good enough for the time given. The new pilot Noriko with a famous dad, who isn't that good a piloting. Improves over the course of the show to become better, being driven at times by revenge and also a wish to stop the enemy and saving everybody on Earth. While improving she gets assistance from the various characters, and finally grows enough to be able to pilot the ultimate mech that gets used to save the day. The enemy they are fighting never really gets developed in any way, it is just a mindless enemy they are trying to defeat before it gets to Earth. \n\nBy the end I enjoyed my time with it, but am left wishing it had more time to tell it's story. Because 6 episodes just wasn't enough to tell the full story them wanted to and develop these characters in the meaningful ways they wanted to. But I would still say go ahead and watch it if you feel like watching an old decent mech show. "}, {"id": 3061, "score": 69, "body": "I'm going to come right out and say it: I struggled with A Certain Magical Index. It didn't start that way. In fact, I loved it for a good bit. But then, I began to to realize that I was having certain issues with the general trajectory of the story-line. It was somewhat strange for me, because, generally, I like Magical Index's genre. The story with the main character who has \"special powers\" and can't help but attract new recruits for his harem wherever he goes. It reminded me a bit of Strike the Blood, which I enjoyed a great deal more. Maybe you could say that Strike the Blood improved upon the formula of Magical Index, which came a good 7 years before it, or maybe I'm just biased because I watched Strike the Blood first. Either way, I was disappointed with Magical Index, especially in the latter third or so and I'll explain why, but first I'll go over what I liked.\n\nI really liked the premise of Magical Index for one. The idea of magic versus science is a really strong premise and, at first, I thought that it was executed really well. The first arc with Index was a great blend of magic and science, with Touma working in both worlds really well. However, they kind of lost me a few arcs later as I began to see the same premise essentially re-skinned and re-used. That's about the time I began to wonder if Magical Index was just really formulaic. The second thing I liked was Touma's ability. I didn't love Touma himself too much, I was more indifferent than anything about him, but what made him stand out to me was his power. Touma's right hand possesses Imagine Breaker which can destroy any kind of supernatural power. It's kind of a unique take on the \"powerful MC\" trope that dominates most, if not all, supernatural shows and allows for more unique conflicts, even if they usually just end up as \"Touma punches something with his right hand as hard as he can\". Finally, I loved Mikoto Misaka. This may be something of a personal preference, but I thought that she was the best character in the entire show. It wasn't that far through that I realized that she was the only reason I was watching in the first place. In a show about supernatural abilities and unnatural situations, Mikoto felt like the most human character in the show. She was strong, but she also had weaknesses. She was confident, but also had insecurities. Maybe all of this praise is just my best girl bias, but she definitely kept me watching. With all that said, I'll probably watch A Certain Scientific Railgun just for her.\n\nOh boy, what didn't I like? Pretty much every other character, outside of a few like Accelerator, Kanzaki, Himegami, and Kuroko. I disliked the magic arcs a lot, they felt really boring and convoluted compared to the much more interesting and grounded scientific arcs. I think the big thing about the magic portions of the show was that they felt unrestrained. At least in the show, there are no rules to the magic, like how the hell does it even work? Is it just whatever you can think up, is it grimoire based? Who knows?  Like I mentioned above, I really dislike the direction of the story. I could basically feel the insane escalation coming. I mean, I could already tell that it was just going to get crazier and crazier, but the fact that it was getting ridiculous in the first season was kinda concerning. Kind of a side point, I spoiled myself a little bit and found out that Touma's harem just keeps growing to ridiculous proportions and he just strings them all along kind of made me a little upset. I would be the first person to admit that harems can be fantastic, but there's a point where the constant adding of girls should just stop and use the girls that are there. However, the greatest sin in Magical Index is who else but Index herself. Oh God, she made me want to pull the trigger of the gun that I put to my skull every time she was on screen.\n\nEven if the above paragraph made it seem like I despised Magical Index with every fiber of my body, I really did enjoy it for the majority of the run-time. Something just stopped working toward the end, causing my enjoyment to really suffer. It's something that I really can't put my finger on. Because, by all means, I should love Magical Index, seeing as it has everything I could ever want from an anime. There was just something there that really makes me not want to finish. At this point, I have no idea if I'll finish or not. I probably will at some point, but it won't be for a while. I'll probably watch Scientific Railgun for more of best girl sooner."}, {"id": 3067, "score": 50, "body": "~!_Watashitachi no Shiawase na Jikan_ is 8 chapters long and fits in a single volume.  There's nothing wrong with being short, of course, a story told in a short period of time has the advantage of being able to be much more focused and only deal with what it cares to.  There's no expectation to fill in details and the rules for pacing become much looser.  However, this short manga completely throws away the natural advantage that the form it takes affords it, and bounces between the questions of the death penalty + redemption, a romance story, grief, loss, suicide, recovery, family, and a few other thematic tendrils that never really go anywhere. \n\nThis all makes the main focus, meaning the questions surrounding the death penalty and redemption of those who commit heinous acts, muddy and under-explored.  What we're given can be summarized (leaving very little of substance out) like this: \"People do bad things, but they are not always inherently bad people, some do bad things because of their own situation.  How much can we forgive due to circumstances?  Should someone be killed for something they would never do again, making them no longer a threat?\"\n\nThose are big and important questions that it looks as if _Watashitachi no Shiawase na Jikan_ is going to try and wrestle with.  Unfortunately, it doesn't really.  It does a decent enough job at showing that those positions exist and, to its credit, gets a bit of emotional backing for each.  The thing is, that doesn't give you much.  If you've thought about this issue once in your life, which I assume most readers who make their way here have, you're already familiar with everything this manga has to throw at you.  I would never expect or hold a piece of art / storytelling to the standard of having to give me a revelation about the nature of a conflict like this or even to have a completely unique take, but I would expect something other than what one would expect to be the starting point.\n\nPutting emotions to things that are already understood by the reader is an entirely acceptable goal, however, and I don't want to give the impression that I have a problem with a story where that's its only ambition.  The problem with that, in reference to this story in particular, is that it doesn't focus on those emotions enough or tell a good enough story of romance and loss for it to work.  It's more concerned with presenting the ideas as if they are revelatory, wasting precious time that it could be using for justifying itself in other ways.\n\nI haven't read the novel that this was adapted from, so I could never claim to know where these problems were introduced.  I could see them coming from a clumsy adaptation, but I can't say for sure.  Still, it kept me invested, the facial expressions were particularly on point, and it didn't do anything outwardly _wrong_.  I just can't give it much credit beyond being somewhat entertaining, and it clearly was grasping for much more than that.!~"}, {"id": 3077, "score": 57, "body": "Everyone has a different form of perception, how they see reality and everything in it. We can see a show or movie and have different reactions to it and notice different things in it. We can have different political opinions, views on society, or subject preferences. Once you think of it, it's quite fascinating, and in many cases, outright chaotic.\n\nAfter dressing itself up in psychology and philosophy Caligula is a fascinating and musically endearing, if awkward, convoluted, and jarringly done foray into just how fucked perceptions are. It jumps off from its premise to deliver a unique experience in the name of establishing the credibility to tell you something: don't get too attached to escapism and accept reality. \n\nJust think about it. It's antagonists -Mu and mediocre cronies services mostly for their themes- are well-intentioned extremists who have indulged far too deeply into escapism. We get to see everyone be subjected to the most disgusting and aggressive versions of what we do to take a break on our daily life, as characters confront their true feelings and unravel themselves to us. People getting so lost into their music that they go ham on people, people engaging so hard in tea parties that they actually eat the fake silverware and stuff themselves so obscenely, people wishing so hard to become someone else that they end up living a fake life? This shit and more is all here! The presentation of this, coupled with the presentation of how off and disturbing the events are, is all directed strikingly. Even though the writing effectively has to handwave potentially awkward shit about not perceiving explosions and managing to perforce yourself in a completely different body and life, it manages to work without much explanation. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s such as shame that some revelations are so detrimental and that there are several asspulls and unexplained actions/circumstances -most of which are concerns with the second half-. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not even mention how the final quarter falls apart until the final 13 minutes, as the way it opens certain cans of worms ranges from interesting to devastating, even more so than the second half already began doing.\n\nHowever, while the narrative was mostly well-presented, the characters are in the exact opposite scenario. There are a lot of them, both on the protagonist and antagonist side. None of them have distinctly interesting personalities or motivations sans Mu, and the sheer amount means that we have to juggle a bunch of largely uninteresting characters, several of whom don't get explored in interesting ways. Even the ones that do such as Mifune, are not very memorable despite their intriguing dilemmas and breakdowns. The protagonist (Ritsu) is the second closest thing to a real character, and aside from him enthusiastically getting into psychology and sociology terminology whilst presenting them to the characters and audience, there isn't really much to him either. Even seemingly important side/characters take forever to even be introduced beyond what the opening and closing credits show us. I guess it makes it hard to write them inconsistently, as most of them are more like vessels with singular, often abandoned traits. Good writing that does make, and even with the one good character they have, its counterbalanced brutally towards the end with a certain twist villain who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basically Seryuu from Akame ga Kill.\n\nThe dialogue is also sometimes clumsy enough to remind me that the person writing the story with the message likely hasn't entirely escaped the damages a sheltered or escaped reality has on one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s writing, perception of real people, and how they talk. Perhaps some time to iron things out and spend time with these characters experiencing the type of pain and escapism integral to their stories would make them a bit more interesting. Then again, the show is so blunt, even hamfisted about its messages that it almost hurts despite how good they are to hear, and how plentiful the themes used for it are.\n\nStudio Satelight had about as much trouble as the writing, it seems. The character designs -sans Mu- are all a tad awkward and it feels like they had to limit the animation for the sake of keeping the sharp yet awkward (and incredibly pale) character models perfectly in check. Flashbacks galore and some occasionally jarring CGI only worsen the deal, especially when the presentation makes odd decisions like occasionally reducing characters to white or other colored silhouettes, or having them not move during their walking animations sometimes. The fight scenes are pretty terrible too, with Akame ga Kill sound effects and perfunctory at best choreography to boot. It all temporarily comes crashing down in the finale -along with the writing-. Shame given that the directing and presentation by Junichi Wada makes several sequences engaging, using static to really sell how off things feel, while constantly showing different visual perspectives and changing up the lighting and colors when things go insane. The visuals for the opening are especially captivating, with a more unique filter and overall darker and more mind-bending style.\n\nSpeaking of the opening, \"Paradigm Box\" by Ritsu Shikishima (Chiharu Sawashiro), Shougo Satake (Shunsuke Takeuchi), is one of the better openings of the season, with nice vocals and a somewhat unique feel in places (notably right before the chorus). The ending theme \"HYPNO\" by Kotono Kashiwaba (Rie Murakawa), Naruko Morita (Ari Ozawa), Mifue Shinohara (Rie Takahashi), Suzuna Kagura (Minami Tanaka) is also a worthwhile listen, even if it feels like forcing it to be 90 seconds stretches it. The vocal tracks performed by Mu are even more fun to listen to, and the lyrics are pretty good at reflecting the overall themes of each song that relate to the show (as well as the RPG game the show adapts). Sure, some get replayed quite often, and the rest of the OST is mostly just decent with the exception of the track \"The Fairy of Dreams\", but that doesn't stop me from listening to this OST on my own time.\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a shame this show isn't as well-received or as great as it could be since it's messages are beneficial, even important for the anime community and Japan at large to hear. If only it was as worth the recommendation I wish to give it, as it was certainly entertaining in its madness and ideals. Regardless, it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bad, so if you prefer the message to anything else, or want something out of the ordinary, perhaps this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a bad choice to consider."}, {"id": 3080, "score": 65, "body": "Rarely is the world of Search & Rescue looked at and the last place I expected to see it done with some accuracy was in an anime.

Am I new to anime? No. Am I a Shounen lover? No. Perfect- the least amount of bias. \n\nBefore we begin, I'll give you a little background on what this anime is about. In essence, two brothers decide to revive their dead mother, but failed and one brother, Al, lost his body. The other lost his leg and later, his arm. These two then decide to be civil servants, while also attempting to achieve their goal- to get their bodies back. \n\nThe first few episodes start with explaining the events of FMA, summarising its plot and staying true to the manga. Without spoiling, it's impossible to do a decent review, so beyond this point those who haven't watched the anime I urge you to form your own opinion about it before continuing. \n\nThe humor of FMAB relies solely on long awkward pauses and cartoon imagery that's often overused and bland. The same gag is used so often that it destroys the immersion that FMAB already lacks. \n\nBut this anime is a Shounen, right? Let's focus on the fight scenes then.\n\nThe opening fight between Elsa and the brothers was shockingly the best in the anime. Huge chunks of ice being generated, the skills of other state alchemists being displayed- one couldn't ask for a more exciting battle. The \"Oh my god he doesn't need a transmutation circle!\" opened the door to many possibilities, leading the watcher to believe that Ed is full of potential and maybe (?) OP. \n\nHowever as the anime goes along, we learn that he has the fighting ability of a chimpanzee, with him barely using any alchemy during fights and instead, using the same spear every battle. If you had the ability to create giant pillars to chase after a pickpocket toddler, what would you do against a serial killer? He could perhaps...\n\n1) throw rocks that turn into spears like Baldy Fist\n2) turn moisture into water\n3) try to IP man his fight against a seasoned war veteran __(Ding ding!)__\n\nThis leads me to another flaw. It's barely explained what alchemy actually is. Sure, the \"LaW 0f 3quIvaLeNt EXchAnG3\" is shoved down our throats every opening sequence, but the exact mechanism is yet to be explained. Why can't Ed just create a metal box every time he needs to catch someone like Lan Fan? I know Chinese women are known for their ferocity, but saying she can break through steel is too much. Again, there's just so much potential in Ed that the anime refuses to use. Lust's death was satisfying to say the least, but for someone with the ultimate spear, it's barely been used properly. She couldn't even kill 2 men with it, and then she died shortly after all that trash talking. If this doesn't make it into the top 10 saddest anime deaths, I don't know what will. \n\nLet's talk about the music. When I mused about what to write for this section, I actually asked myself- was there even a single musical note in the entire anime? The soundtrack was so forgettable and sometimes even mismatched. I would still give credit to the first OP of the anime, as that was written beautifully. \n\nRegarding the plot, the anime has tons of potential. I daresay the directing of the whole anime was what pulled FMAB down. If Yasuhiro Irie had taken the anime to a Tokyo Ghoul cum Akame ga Kill-esque plot, I think the plot would have been much better represented. For an action orientated anime, the pacing is terrible. With fight scenes mixed with cartoony reactions and humor, I can't help but compare this to Gintama. Gintama balances between comedy and action so well, with the occasional remarks from the leads leaving a smile on my face. I found the casual conversations between Al and Gluttony, and Ed and Envy ridiculous- they're the villains for crying out loud!\n\nTo conclude, it was an interesting watch. This anime has loads of potential but its pacing and overall direction needs tweaking. I often found myself dissociated from the anime and staring blankly at the screen. To others, FMAB may be a a gift from Santa himself. To me, FMAB will always be an anime that one would only watch after getting their brains fried by the better, more immersive seasonal anime. Unfortunately, I fall into the minority who dislike FMAB."}, {"id": 3093, "score": 66, "body": "Remember when this shows got a lot of appreciation in the beginning, the rating was so high until it spills out, but falling bit by bit towards the end? Darling in the FranXX was a highly overhyped anime at the time. That said, it's overhyped to the point that some drama is happening in the real world as like your life is not enough dramas. It's considered one of the best mecha and the next \"Evangelion\" which beat thousands of mecha anime included Code Geass and Gurren Lagann. Darling in the FranXX has no different from Guilty Crown which almost takes the same premise but it's different from all aspects. The art is great for three studio that is working on this anime even A-1 Pictures and Trigger is a studio that is still active in it. Well, there is no excuse if many people consider that Darling in the FranXX is one of the worst that people want to follow their own opinion by creating a controversy and agenda in it so that it ends with an endless debate. For me, it's not as \"bad\" that people considered even the rest they really hate it.\n\nFirst of all, we'll talk about what this anime is intended and what it really means. For me, the story seems to wanna insert a philosophy about ethnicity, God, human, and race. This is not a wannabe of 2001: A Space Odyssey that has a depth meaning which is we still discussed today or Darren Aronofsky's Mother! which falls in place. The main part of this show isn't a vaguely fascinated story, taking a distant background from the future, and there is a lot of stuff to be understood. Initially, there are no backstories of all the characters where you want to look for it and want to find out from the beginning. The essence of the story at the beginning focuses on Hiro's intention of trying to become a pilot who drives FranXX when he is revealed fail at that. For the first episode, it's kinda cool when you're setting up an action with goosebump package at the beginning so you want to watch the next episode. However, it just keeps out of track where some episodes seem to bring up many plot holes that filled with some fanservice and pointless fillers. I mean, this isn't a slice of life such as a teenager who fills their everyday life with a normal day. This is not a teen trying to become adults. Some random stuff happening in each episode so it happens again and again with give you no connection but it's just a mixed up to fill every blank episode. That random stuff which is almost filled with no explanation becomes one of the important points that never runs linearly. It's like a wrecking train that goes on the wrong track where the track is a dead end. The last five episodes aren't a guarantee that this anime will bring up something twist where it also fails. It's like the last five episodes done by different screenwriters or different studios without any analysis. The analogy, everything at the beginning of the story, mid-story, climax, Klaxosaurs, and FranXX becomes pointless when a deus ex machina or the real antagonist appears and falls into the main part which results in a slightly compelling story-writing. For the most part, the relationship between Klaxosaurs and humans is a good part and with the backstory between Zero Two and Hiro is also the best of all. Some background before it all begins is also very good with a pretty of slow-paced storytelling but those parts are not the problem. However, the next part which was initially filled with an uplifting and emotional plot disappeared immediately when the next part is coming. There is a lot of NTR crap that covers up the good part like the backstories between Zero Two and Hiro leaves once when the next plot comes up and it gives you one more damn thing that has a pointless thing from the start which it failed to give all sympathy to its character to the viewers.\n\nThe art is decent for the most part and it gives you many anticipated for this aspect. Honestly, they do it very well and even exceed both A-1 Pictures and Trigger. I don't know what's really going on with CloverWorks or maybe there's an obstruction where the studio didn't take too much participation. It has a colorful background just like the Trigger studio they always do, the action scene is great, and it's catching the scenery at the eyes. Actually, this gives me a realistic expectation where I previously expected a lot with this anime because of its studio. Bottom line, the animation is decent along with the visuals regardless of the story which is too much to bring up the plot holes that is not related.\n\nThe soundtrack is great too, honestly. It gives you a quick background, especially at the opening theme song. KISS OF DEATH by Mika Nakashima x Hyde is not too memorable and it feels repetitive whatever this is a 24 episode anime. Typically, anime with 24 episodes used two or more openings in the first cour and second cour. The ending theme songs are actually memorable for me. Not to monotonous but it gives some point to these. This aspect can be said to be good from many points of view especially the soundtrack when the action scene and the dramatic sound effect is actually really good. As with animation, it gives me a real quick explanation of this. The voice actor is great too, especially Kana Ichinose as Ichigo which is her best debut despite the number of douchebags that send death threats for her. For the rest, everything also has a nice role regardless of its weak script but it gives you one point to the voice actor.\n\nSo, let's move on to the characters which there are a lot to talk about this. First of all, the MC in this series. Hiro and Zero Two became one of the main parts regardless of the rest of the other supporting characters. Hiro is one of the typical characters who is cliche and too monotonous. In various scenes, not too much can be done for his character that doesn't take a quick action. Although he performs a wide role in various side characters, especially when the background tells when he gave a name to all his friends, apart from that part he is just the same selfish character as only concerned with Zero Two than others. Maybe because this anime wants to add some drama and romance in it, that's the points. Zero Two is a deus ex machina character because if there is no Zero Two, Hiro will never be the main character. It gives you some sympathy from her character especially on her backstories and flashback which gives you some the sympathy explanation to her. But, Hiro and Zero Two just like the same as Yuzuru and Kanade from Angel Beats! they belong to the same couple with same goals apart I also don't like the anime. Hiro and Zero Two, on the other hand, are like two inseparable characters just for ridiculous reasons to add a bit of the romance element. In a nutshell, it's just like \"I want to be with you forever\" type of characters. Ichigo is not one of the wrong character types regardless of what I said. Her relationship with Hiro makes her a character who's said to be a \"slut\" but for me, she is not a character like that. I just look like someone who protects her character but her relationship with Goro isn't well-explanation deeper. There is no explanation and process between the two characters, especially at the ending. The backstory between Hiro, Goro, and Ichigo are actually really good but there is little potential for it. The relationship between Futoshi and Kokoro is similar to Goro and Ichigo who have the same problem. Futoshi is like a character who doesn't have much role with Kokoro but Kokoro is typically one of the ignorant characters who'll turn to a relationship between Mitsuru which makes an NTR again. In a nutshell, it's like \"I wanna be inside of you\" or simple, Kokoro wants a baby. Miku and Zorome are like a rivalry though it doesn't seem to keep each feeling between the two of them. Not much can be found for both of them but there is no background to their character from the beginning of their appearance to the end. Apart from those, there is nothing to discuss for them because it seems like they are quickly forgotten when in fact it's also an important point for their role both more freely. Ikuno doesn't fully participate much in the story apart from her relationship with Ichigo just came out. The simple is I'm not concerned about there is a character of yuri among normal characters but it gives you in the worst way and time which is not fit that I feel there is something stuck in here. Oh and by the way, don't think that Naomi has so many roles. She is just a character that appears at the beginning and at the end, not too self-explanatory but it gives you a damn.\n\nThe idea of sharing sympathy with one with another but easily forgotten isn't a good thing. We care about their character because they have good backstories, experience, and development, not a character that just added and thrown away. The last arc I think is the jokes from all those aspects. It's like a wannabe of Star Wars, Interstellar, and The Martian. Spaceballs is even better than the last arc. The deus ex machina of the antagonist is really out of nowhere that it just comes straight away. When two warring nations just work together, it gave you ridiculous expectation, right? What a joke. Let me straighten out, everything from the beginning of the bloodshed between humans and Klaxosaurs when it reaches the last arc becomes useless. In a nutshell, it's just waste your freaking times and I said that because there are not enough jokes in this anime. The rest of the plot holes is just way too far. There is a lot of question that arises which isn't 2001: A Space Odyssey, as I said, where you need thousands of interpretations without any clear explanation. Why didn't Hiro care much about his friends? Why is Ichigo the leader of all? Is there any background before they are trained or something? Why should the children? Why are adults described as scumbags in this anime? Is there any background to why Zero Two is called a partner killer? Has anything happened before then? There are many questions that are still vague in this anime and somehow, they don't seem to care much. Bottom line, there are some aspects that can be considered good but too many aspects that feel pointless until that rating it's like a joke for you and they laugh at you. And I just want to quote one of the most popular quotes in classic AVGN (by replacing the word 'game' as 'anime' in it): \"This anime is diarrhea coming out of my dick! This anime is as appealing as a fucking ooze-infested dirty fucking sewer rat shit! I've had more fun playing with dog turds! Shredder's my ass and Splinter's my balls! This anime is an inside-out asshole regurgitating putrid anal fecal matter! I'd rather fucking yank all the hairs out of my scrotum! I'd rather drink diarrhea vomited out of a buffalo's anus! It sucking fucks, it fucking sucks, it fucking blows, it's a piece of shit... and I don't like it.\"\n\nDarling in the FranXX isn't as bad as people considered. Sure, it has so many flaws and even more, failing to make it look like a philosophy theme filled with thousands of pointless segments and scenes. Not too bad apart from some serious issue when the anime is still on-going at the time and their fanboys are feeling high-appreciation with this anime. When compared to it, the fandom is worse than the anime as the anime was not enough worse as the fandom. They praised this anime and considered other mecha anime such as Evangelion, Gundam, and Code Geass is garbage. I mean, I'm not too into that three series but it's too overrated I bet. Similar to Sword Art Online fandom, comparing it to Berserk is like a kitten and a tiger that wants to fight. Perhaps, my exposure was too high when this anime first came out and got a lot of positive response regardless of its on-going. Darling in the FranXX cannot be said 'so bad it's good' and will never fall into the category. In a nutshell, I recommend this anime to people who also love Sword Art Online. Great direction but falling to the original premise."}, {"id": 3098, "score": 54, "body": "When a film trilogy is created, its second installment is almost expected to be the hardest and most crucial element. When a recap trilogy is released, it's almost an expectation that the second film is the weakest one. As such, even if the first recap film of a tv series succeeds, one must look at the second with trepidation. The grand finale is saved for last, so the bulk of the narrative that film 1 didn't cover and that isn't the home stretch will be rushed tremendously. This is why -especially for longer series- a 4 part structure would be much better. Code Geass Movie 2 manages to be the perfect way to illustrate its point and then some, failing both due to this structure and due to other issues.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------Spoilers Ahead-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis was inevitably going to be a weaker product than the first. Not only is this because of the problems inherent in the 3 film recap structure and what had to be cut, but also because the messy nature of the original material at this point, with the final \u00e2\u0085\u0093 of Geass 1 being its shoddiest portion and R2 being clumsy in general. I could accept that. I could accept the fact that the nature of Geass 1 having to do as much and cut out as much as it did would make Euphemia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death scene with Suzaku, and therefore Suzaku\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vengeful drive, less effective. It did remove most of Euphamia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scenes with Suzaku, gutting their relationship. I could deal with all of this if they found a way to treat this issue with tact instead of skipping important scenes, relegating explanations to offhand dialogue in conversations, making baffling decisions on what to keep and what not to alter, and forgetting what a fucking transition is!\n\nThis goes beyond the typical failures of the second recap installment! Why would they still try to act like Euphamia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death hurt Suzaku as much as it did in the original series given that they did not establish these two as lovers in this trilogy? Why make it so Suzaku can magically sense C.C\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presence inside the Gawain? Why alter and remove Lelouch losing his composure and haphazardly telling his subordinates to take over after Nunally was kidnapped? While they thankfully didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go as hard on Nina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bomb insanity at the school given what was cut out, why didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they remove that entirely or at least alter it so that she decided to start making bombs for the Britannian military? Who thought removing the entirety of the events of R2 episode 1 was a good idea! That was essential to making the second half of this film even remotely function, and they skipped it and tried to justify it with two throwaway lines. Now there are several damning questions regarding that integral moment and afterwards, none of which were an issue in R2. Why would they not show what made Jeremiah go turncoat? Given their alterations, all they had to do was have Lelouch reveal himself to Jeremiah and have the original scene play out as it did but with new context. Why was the new footage of Oghi confronting Viletta handled with the level of tact you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d expect from trash like Darling in the FranXX? Why did they not let scenes have breathing room to transition? Why when V.V crashed and everyone was standing by, did they immediately follow up with him already at the door that was likely far away, with him about to die? Why didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they have a scene in between of Lelouch going to and entering the door that led to the Sword of Akasha? So many of these were simple fixes, some of which were integral to making this film even remotely function with the broken pieces of what it was adapting.\n\nNow we must move onto the problems I originally anticipated, and what else would have only been natural issues given the structure. The Eupheminator section was even worse now that the context of Lelouch and Euphemia meeting at Kimine island, and the Mao arc\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foreshadowing of the already disgustingly convenient Geass breakdown in the Eupheminator section, were both removed. They made the scene of Charles somehow observing the Eupheminator incident get delayed by a few minutes for little reason; they could have just removed it at that point given that it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t serve much of a purpose. I did anticipate Suzaku\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in that part not changing, but again, this was a simple fix: just make him act more like a friend than a lover to Euphemia and make him angry that Zero was such a manipulator who tainted his partner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s noble goals. This was part of why he was angry in the original so they only needed that. The entirety of the collapse of the Black Rebellion was truncated, but that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t excuse the poor editing around this point that massively required transitions -such as Lelouch departing and telling his people to fend for themselves-. The scene of Lelouch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reveal and capture was far less effective given the structure of this film. Simply put, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basically two truncated films merged into one, given that the most climactic portion, the finale and subsequent cliffhanger of R1, was placed right before the middle. It inevitably led to a terribly awkward structure that made the movie feel like it began again in the middle, establishing what the beginning of R2 did with some changes here and there. Every new character introduced here is as lame or even weaker than you remember them, except for Bismark, who actually gets more focus here than in the original. Even Lelouch got downgraded due to their surprisingly malicious and sadly rushed interpretation of him. Given that Lelouch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bomb in the final act of the film was there to blow up Rolo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mech in order to take down V.V once he landed, the fact that what appears to be the exact same button was used in order for the Gawain to shoot out mirrors in order for Lelouch to Geass Charles, is disconcerting. They still kept C.C\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mental regression into the slave girl she was before getting the Geass, for no good reason. Lastly, they did not need to go to episode 41 of the original material, effectively covering 25 episodes worth of content, half the episode count of the original. This was far too much to cover, hence why this film felt like it was 2 films crammed into one. Adding onto that, this meant they had ended up diving into the part where R2 began truly crumbling into pieces. It honestly should have been two films in order to salvage everything past the 30-minute mark, and so that most of this would not have happened.\n----------------------------------------------------------------No spoilers beyond this point---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn spite of all this, I cannot be too angry at this film. The primary reason being the new footage present. These films do an exceptional job at plugging up certain holes from the original story, cutting out certain portions that were unfavorable, strengthening the core narrative, and bolstering the relationships of every family member of Lelouch, sans Euphemia. This film is especially exceptional at that. For starters, it addressed Lelouch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lack of structure with the Black Knights by outlining each important members\u00e2\u0080\u0099 roles and whatnot. Lelouch and Suzaku\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lack of punishment for frequently ditching school for their roles in the grander narrative was addressed as well. The writers added scenes of Lelouch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family members talking to each other, either casually, about what to do about a recent event, or about their disagreement with each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goals -specifically Charles and Schneizel remarking negatively about each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goals to their subordinates-. There was so much new content added in, with almost all of it going out of its way to fix some of the issues present in the original material, even outside of what was mentioned. Despite how bad this film may be, the new scenes and what they did deserve to be commended, proving that the team did know what they were doing sometimes. As such, there no further mention of them in specifics or in influence here, beyond the direction they took with Shirley being a nice gesture that saved time and the continuation of their more intimate and loving interpretation of C.C and Lelouch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship.\n\nThe visuals are even better than they were before. The new scenes manage to blend in even better than those of the previous film did, and R2\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inferior production values did not hinder the film as much, given that next to no badly done CGI was present until the final 20 minutes of the film. The directing by Gorou Taniguchi excelled here, with far more usage of interesting camera angles and movement -next to none of which were present in the original beyond possibly one moment towards the end with C.C- to ramp up the conveyed tension present in the new scenes in particular. Said new scenes were even more plentiful than before, often shining a light on the modified direction the narrative took here.\n\nThe music was handled wonderfully once again. While the mediocre first ending theme of Geass was used as the opening for this movie, the ending was an entirely new song. While \"The Moon\" by Sakura Fujiwara (\u00e8\u0097\u00a4\u00e5\u008e\u009f\u00e3\u0081\u0095\u00e3\u0081\u008f\u00e3\u0082\u0089), was not as good of an ending song as \u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly Red is Missing\u00e2\u0080\u009d from the previous film, it is certainly a good song. There were tracks I wish I heard but the soundtrack is still as wonderful as ever. On top of that, there were some new tracks added in that also worked well, from vocal to non-vocal. It's only to be expected at this point.\n\nCode Geass Movie 2 was a massive disappointment. It not only had to deal with the typical issues of a second recap installment but the ways it botched up its already wrecked material obliterated this film on a structural and content writing level. Every concern I had and more came to pass. After the first film did such a wonderful job adapting the first \u00e2\u0085\u0093 of the show, this had no excuse to be this subpar, material quality aside. Given that the final film only needs to cover 9 episodes now instead of 13-16 or up to 25, maybe there is potential for this trilogy to be salvaged. Given how badly this one panned out, what this may do to the next installment, and what it has to adapt, we best pray for a miracle."}, {"id": 3103, "score": 69, "body": "Orange.\n\nAn anime about time travelling letters, romance, great art and friendship. It tells the tale of two socially retarded individuals, Naho and Cuck, and how their relationship develops and saves the mentally unstable boy. Along with 4 of their friends, they work together to ensure Kakeru doesn't kill himself yet again.\n\nThe story starts off with Naho being late for class, after reading a letter supposedly from the future. \"Don't invite brunette out after school today\" It said. Naho, despite that, doesn't stop any of her friends from inviting him out, albeit understandably. Firstly, she had no idea if the letter was reliable or just some prank. Secondly, it would be one hell of an awkward situation if she were to be against welcoming the new kid into their town.\n\nOff they go choosing bread and Kakeru's mother ends up dying because like her son, she is mentally unstable and killed herself. This is essentially the basis for everything that happens in the anime. Let's finally get started on the review.\n\nThe art was the first thing I noticed. It was crisp, nostalgic and fluid. Easy on the eyes and calming, it was one of the better animations I've seen. Each picture sets a fitting atmosphere, although the atmosphere itself could be enhanced with more activity from the public, instead of the scene showing only Naho and Kakeru for the entire duration. \n\nThe music was alright, it wasn't memorable but it was very fitting. I appreciate the opening sequence for giving me goosebumps with how... nostalgic it feels. It's as if I were travelling back to the countryside to my home, with my childhood memories waiting for me. \n\nOne thing Orange does right is the brilliant characters. Brilliant _side_ characters. Suwa, Shinpachi, Azula and tall brunette girl were the best wing men you could ask for, and the most reliable friends. They constantly wash down my rage with their smart decisions and quick saves, like Naho vs Short hair senior girl, ending with Naho running away and Suwa stopping her. Azu was really a bubbly character, often turning the gloomy atmosphere into a warm one. Tall brunette girl....just keep doing whatever you're doing. \n\nPlotwise, this anime is like Shiina Mashiro. Smart, artistic and absolutely destroys tests with perfect grades, but doesn't realise you can't run your finger against the blade of a knife. I love how they barely explained how the letters went back in time- that wasn't the point of the anime and I'm glad they didn't throw in some Deus ex machina. However, the constant retardedness of Naho and Kakeru's uncontrollable rage- hitting her, ignoring her all while claiming \"hurrr i just didnt wanna git close to you innit?\"- worsened the experience of what could be a great anime. \n\nOne thing that majorly irritates me is how all the future characters INCLUDING suwa ship Naho with Cuck despite Naho ALREADY MARRIED TO SUWA. What is this foul smelling shit? It doesn't make sense at all. Despite Naho saying \"I'll choose you even if Kakeru were alive\", it doesn't help that she EXPLICITLY states in the letter that she regrets not confessing and dating Kakeru. \n\nDespite the cockamamie plot (In the last quarter of the anime, the first 3 quarters are actually fine) Kakeru's \"ticking time bomb-esque behavior\" and \"easily angered\" behavior seemed over exaggerated. I don't get what Naho sees in him. I felt that the writing doesn't justify his anger most of the time, especially during the shrine visit. The anime went downhill after episode 9 and that is extremely unfortunate, because aiming to let the viewers leave with a sweet taste should be a goal amongst all content creators. \n\nIn conclusion, Orange is a slightly heavy slice of life/romcom, but it is definitely worth the watch if you're a sucker for such things. I never regretted watching this anime once; It was a good experience and heartwarming watch. I'm sure we all wished for friends we don't come close to deserving, like Suwa, Hagita, Azusa and Takako.

From beautiful and cute designs such as Genet, Honey, and Jill, to the unsettling designs of most of the Panther Claw members, to the unique designs of characters such as Naoko. The only design I didn't quite care for was Danbei's. We'll get back to him in a moment.\n\nThe music is also pretty great. I didn't notice at first, but a lot of the tracks are insanely catchy and practically burst with groove and/or style. Sister Jill's theme in particular is a standout track. I wish there was an OST.\n\nNow, time to get to the story. There's a reason why I'm talking about this last. Yes, it exists, and no, it's not terrible perse.\n\nIt's just not very good, either.\n\nThe premise is as follows: Honey Kisaragi is an android attending the all-girls academy, Saint Chapel. When not attending school, Honey works alongside the law-enforcement organization, PCIS, as the superheroine of love, Cutie Honey. As of late, her days as Cutie Honey are spent fighting the mysterious organization known as Panther Claw, a crime gang filled with monstrous women. Honey has a personal vendetta against Panther Claw, for they are responsible for her father's death. Panther Claw desires the device that allows Cutie Honey to transform, the Airborne Element Fixing Device. Making matters more complicated is the fact that her new partner has a secret identity of her own: Sister Jill, the leader of Panther Claw.\n\nThe premise sounds interesting enough, but its true potential is never realized. Honey's double-life is hardly acknowledged, to the point where the anime hardly makes it clear that Honey's best friend, Nat-Chan, doesn't know she's Cutey Honey. The mysterious organization, Panther Claw, remains just that, mysterious. We're never given a definite answer to their origin or motivation. While this in and of itself isn't terrible, Cutie Honey Universe has so little going for it, story-wise, that this lack of detail really shows. We're also not given much detail of Honey's life before Dr. Kisaragi was murdered.\n\nIf you were expecting a serious narrative, you'll be sorely disappointed with Cutie Honey Universe. The anime plays out like a (strangely sexual) Saturday morning cartoon. Monster of the week format? Check. Somewhat low stakes? Check. Plot seemingly standing still no matter the recent devlopment? Check. Don't get me wrong, Saturday morning cartoon shows can work. I'm not exactly sure why, but this one just didn't. Maybe the show's characters weren't good enough. Maybe everthing was a bit too static for my taste? I can't pinpoint the reason, but it made it hard to binge the first half of the show.\n\nThe story hits its stride around episode eight, but it's a bit too little too late, having Gundam ZZ's problem of taking too long to get good. Even if things get more serious, Cutie Honey Universe desires to have its cake and eat it too, inserting crude comedic moments that more than ever feel out of place. Still, giving credit where credit's due, the second half saved this show from being rated lower. The finale isn't fantastic, but it's good enough for this type of show.\n\nThe characters aren't terribly interesting. I suppose I should be glad that they're (mostly) inoffensive, however. The characters that stand out the most are Honey, Genet/Jill, Nat-chan, and arguably Naoko. Honey's self-proclaimed title of warrior of love (it's interesting to see how Cutie Honey is a precursor to the _Magical Girl_ genre) is an interesting contrast to Jill's obsession with corruption. I commend the show on its depiction of sexuality. It was revolutionary in the 70s and its still pretty marvel for an anime today.\n\nNow, let's talk about Danbei and Junbei Hayami, easily the worst characters of the show. The former is the perverted father of one of Honey's PCIS colleagues, and the latter is his equally perverted son. Their only function is to grope and assault Honey every chance they get and any scene with them is uncomfortable. A particularly horrible scene is when Honey transforms into a statue and the two proceed to lick her breasts and vagina. The show already has panty shots and skin galore, so why in the world were these two characters necessary? Their antics quickly grow frustrating and they leave nothing but a feeling of squick in their wake. No matter the stakes, no matter how bad Honey is feeling, if they have the chance, they _will_ harass her. They can't be audience avatars because no one would want to be these two. If anything, their perverseness would seem to make the audience feel bad that they're indulging themselves in watching the show.\n\nIf you think the fight scenes could elevate the show, you'll be disappointed to find that they're mostly lackluster. They tend to be over too quickly and generally take place in a strange dimension with boring backgrounds. When the fights are interesting, they stand out, but unique fights are few and far between. If a fight drags on, you can bet that it's just to ensure that Honey's clothes will rip.\n\nIf you came for the ecchi and wanted to stay for the story, I can't recommend this anime. It gets better, but a great work of fiction won't have you wade through  rubbish to get to the good parts. Of course, the show is mercifully short, so it's ultimately your call. If you're enticed to watch this show for nothing more than the attractive heroine with a penchant for ripping her clothes, you just might be in for a good time.\n\n6.9/10\n\nAnd by \"6.9/10,\" I meant I just wanted an excuse to be juvenile.\n\n5.9/10"}, {"id": 3107, "score": 69, "body": "Flash back to your childhood: a time where planes were sick, robots were epic, and dragons were the coolest thing in the fucking universe! The paper and the costumes were what let the imagination soar! Games were your blood, pop-culture was your life! Candy was a delicacy rivaled only by pizza! Saturday morning was your weekly holiday! Wasn't all that fun? Wasn't that cool?! Don't you wanna relive some of that childhood wonder?!\n\nIn the cold hard world where nostalgia is ruled by cashgrabs and rewatches, finding an experience that truly, earnestly hardens back to your glory days is in somewhat short supply. Thankfully, Hisone to Maso-tan seeks a new path to fulfill your childlike desires: combining planes, dragons, and giant robots to create a charming experience, nigh-unparalleled in the industry!...at least at first. \n\nWe best start with our protagonist, Hisone Amakasu. She is one of the most adorkable, relatable, and endearing protagonists I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen to date. Seeing this beleaguered dolt of communication in a constant edge of having everything thrust upon her so fast as she tries to wriggle her way out as no one listens to her, and seeing her struggle with not trying to let her blunt brain speak for her, is an absolute joy. Seeing her and Nao snap is a riot given the chemistry they and other characters have with each other -even despite the crass humor that bad LN shows pull-. Their parallels with certain characters early on are also wonderous to display, due to this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s marvelous presentation that is akin to an adult recapturing the whimsey and magic of an astounded child. This presentation additionally makes it easier to overlook the sci-fi jargon and how absurd the premise truly is, with dragons requiring airplane parts in order to somehow transform and blend in, and whatnot. However, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let me dismiss inconsistencies, occasionally clumsy and insular dialogue & events, or any aggravating twists and set-ups. Having a bunch of characters with hit and miss traits and quirks won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change that, no matter how funny the good ones can be. \n\nIt does lose that sense of wonder, much like children do. Soon after the rest of the main cast is introduced, Hisone to Maso-tan focuses more on its growing cast of characters and their problems. It does a decent job with that, but not one substantial enough to truly make up for that loss, especially with a few admittedly small errors in the script. The concept is still too silly to work perfectly -notably with the ridiculous premise of the second half-, and the humor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s highlights aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as high as they were before. The show also transforms into a calculated love map with some out-there twists, so take that as you will.\n\nStudio Bones is famous for their slick visuals, only adding this to their monumental catalog. Frequent bad plane & pilot CGI aside, the flying sequences are an absolute joy to witness, feeling extremely lifelike and kinetic with all sorts of turns, loops, and fast movements done by the OTFs. Speaking of which, the OTF designs are wonderful, most especially Masotan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. The rest of the character designs are well-done and immensely varied, with a wonderful, almost child drawing-esque aesthetic that is tailor-made for bouncy character animation and uproarious facial expressions. It all culminates into a unique visual style that makes this show even more of a joy to watch, even when it transitions past its initial phase.\n\nWhile the music is less commendable, it holds up well enough. The background music is rather nice, fitting with the scenes and sometimes being an emotional listen in their own right. Nothing absurdly memorable stands out but it works well on the whole. The opening, \"Soujo wa Ano Sora wo Wataru (\u00e5\u00b0\u0091\u00e5\u00a5\u00b3\u00e3\u0081\u00af\u00e3\u0081\u0082\u00e3\u0081\u00ae\u00e7\u00a9\u00ba\u00e3\u0082\u0092\u00e6\u00b8\u00a1\u00e3\u0082\u008b)\" by Riko Fukumoto (\u00e7\u00a6\u008f\u00e6\u009c\u00ac\u00e8\u008e\u0089\u00e5\u00ad\u0090), has multiple versions, with only the final one being one I enjoy. The ending, Le temps de la rentr\u00c3\u00a9e\u00e3\u0080\u009c\u00e6\u0081\u008b\u00e3\u0081\u00ae\u00e5\u00ae\u00b6\u00e8\u00b7\u00af\u00ef\u00bc\u0088\u00e6\u0096\u00b0\u00e5\u00ad\u00a6\u00e6\u009c\u009f\u00ef\u00bc\u0089\u00e3\u0080\u009c (Le temps de la rentr\u00c3\u00a9e~Koi no Shingakki~)\", has multiple versions, sung by different people as well as an instrumental version. The song has grown more on me overall, to the point where not only is nearly every version enjoyable, but that it is a preferable song over the opening, even if it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the best of the season or anything.\n\nSuch a shame the show lost what made is so captivating. However, while it never rose to the heights of its early episodes, it does still offer a worthwhile viewing experience, even if that one is more awkward. It even loses some of the bad humor presented early on, even though it lost the better humor on top of that. Spring-boarding off such a wonderful start into something grander is difficult, even with a likable main cast and superb main lead. The show grew to what felt like a teenage -perhaps even adult phase, for better or worse. It grows more insular, less spectacular, and whilst it is a pity, it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lose heart or soul, or even looks. It simply lost its whimsey, much like we all do. Alas, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to return."}, {"id": 3119, "score": 50, "body": "Ah, Kimi no Na wa. The anime movie that spread throughout Japan, and the world, like wildfire. To many, it captured their hearts and took them on a ride. But to others such as myself, it roused up a resounding \"meh\". I don't like reading long reviews, and I don't like writing long reviews, so I'm going to keep this short.\n\nTo start: This movie is a heavily commercialized movie. By commercialized, imagine Michael Bay's _Transformers_ movies. Big budget action scenes, kind of dull but relatable protagonists, hot girls, and Linkin Park. Throw in some storyline and you get butts in theaters seats. _Kimi no Na wa_ follows the same formula, except this time it's big budget thriller scenes, kind of dull but relatable protagonists, a hot guy and a cute girl, and RADWIMPS. Throw in some Japanese traditions and you get butts in theaters seats. While this makes for an enjoyable movie, it does not make for a memorable film. It's like candy. Fun to eat, but it doesn't fill that gaping hole inside you that craves sustenance.\n\nSlightly deeper analysis: Like most commercialized films, the art is fantastic, zero complaints from me. However, the characters and the narrative kind of fall below par. You have Taki, your standard Tokyo boy who's a bit brutish, and you have Mitsuha, your standard country girl who dreams of living in the city. This is all there is to these characters. They are not meant to be some deep character analysis or are really meant to have any kind of impact, they are carefully crafted to invite the viewer to be in their shoes. These two characters swap bodies and experience each other lives and the plot kicks into overdrive (I won't spoil you, but it escalates pretty quickly).\nHowever, major plot events are kind of glossed over with a montage and a RADWIMPS song. It happens several times throughout the movie. Personally, this lack of subtlety makes it hard for me to take the movie seriously, and I wish the movie would have spent more time on developing inner character conflicts than throwing twist after twist at you. If you like plot-driven stories, then you're in for quite a ride! But if your into character-driven stories like I am, the narrative leaves some pretty gaping holes.\n\nConclusion: That's basically it. A movie that attempts to take you onto a roller coaster of events and emotions, but once the ride is over you move onto the next thing and forget what you just rode. The ride may even leave you on the platform, so you get to watch everyone else have fun while you twiddle your thumbs in boredom. It's a worthwile movie to check out, but don't go in expecting some 10/10 masterpiece that will change how you view the world. Imagine yourself walking into a theater to see the latest _Transformers_ flick, and apply those expectations to _Kimi no Na wa_."}, {"id": 3138, "score": 60, "body": "Reading this anime's blurb, I had pretty huge doubts it would be as comical as its premise promised. I mean, the cast is huge, the plot is the simplest thing yet the anime goes on for 22 episodes and the designs are insane enough to make me doubt the anime's realism- as in, how the world and society worked in it compared to ours.\n\nAnd I was 100% right, but watching was still a lot of fun. The characters weren't walking clich\u00c3\u00a9s nor too interesting to steal the show; my favorite is Nagisa -we need more traps MCs- and when I realized that Karma was played by Nobuhiko Okamoto I laughed and was glad he got a role that wasn't just random yelling and threats. All the teachers were enjoyable- with Koro being the most developed of all the characters- and the students got introduction at the right times without overstaying their welcome to the point I had a good grip on everyone's basic personality.\n\nAnd ok, the plot is where it gets shaky. These kids have to kill their teacher or he's going to destroy the world. That kind of threat seems like it'd weigh down on them everyday, but it's barely present. They don't worry about letting great opportunities go and the stress that the whole world's fate is in their hand barely gives them pause. They aren't interested in knowing why Koro destroyed the moon, wants to destroy the world and is now teaching them. And none of them refuse to kill him after he gave them a motivational speech or straightened them up.\n\nAll beliefs that this was happening in our world went out the window at episode 13, however, where one of the teacher gets a bad case of Out of Character-isis and they allow a guy to mercilessly beat the students all day long. Like, this whole system was already shaky, with the teachers and director encouraging bullying of the E class and shamelessly discriminating against them in ways that would've had the parents rioting in the streets, but when that happened my suspension of disbelief turned to me and decided we should part ways.\n\nBecause that's 100% child abuse. It also nulls Koro's job since the guy changed all their schedule to be only physical training and I can't believe that the guy who loses his shit when students endanger themselves to kill him would let the sweetest, nicest 90 pounds girl get fucking slapped across the courtyard by a man three times her size. \n\nAnd the last arc also raised a lot of 'wtf is this' when a guy ~!poisoned half the class, sent assassin at the rest and clearly wants to murder them all,!~ and Koro was like 'you can't kill him'. Like dude what the shit? These kids have been training to kill your ass all this time but you don't want them to use these skills to defend themselves and rid the world of a madman? \n\nBut I did enjoy myself a lot, even if it doesn't look like it haha. The penultimate arc was a lot of fun, as well as the last one apart for that one bullshit logic, the designs are colorful and pretty, the OPs are awesome and the animation is really smooth- haven't read the manga so I have no idea if it's just a panel per panel rendition or anime original at some points but either way it was cool. "}, {"id": 3146, "score": 50, "body": "~~~__Violet Evergarden__~~~\n\nThis show was beautiful... And that's the only thing I can think about to talk. \n\nIt felt like the studio, known best for their astounding animations made their best ever mannequin dressing it up with the most expensive dress they could find. So here too, we end up comparing it to a real life doll. \n\nBut the truth is, if you want more than just a beautiful doll to look at, I mean the actual content, then sorry you are in the wrong place. \n\nThe show is a slice of life with drama mixed in and the everyday stories presented here are meant to be relating to us, each having their own unique theme to tackle in, but the execution from a novel to an anime end up being strange and bland from a storytelling point of view and the development needed of the characters to show in regards to the settings they're put up against is short lived. I could not help but feel the show was held back with the mechanical-like writing just like Violet herself.\n\nI can only think of one such episode which thought to do something other than giving us a pair of characters who are simply in the story to provide with a tear in the end. We go through with their journey and how they end up dealing with their feelings towards one another.\n\nNow coming to the main drawback of the show, we travel in the Victorian style of world with our main character Violet Evergarden. It's funny how the studio decided to animate this show with such precision but failed to give us a main character who can give us emotions to accompany with. \n\nI would argue that humans are _that_ receptive to their surrounding and can be _that_ flat to begin with. We already are familiar with similar apathetic characters who have gone through war with nothing but being a weapon to be used such as Jin-Roh and Fullmetal Alchemist. PTSD should not be used as an excuse for such an underwritten performance as one given by the main character. And the irony being, this flaw is  shown by the pristine art where everyone and everything is made beautiful. \n\nLast but not the least, I would like to talk about the one thing I didn't actually like in the show. The sound.\nGiven such a breathtaking animations with the subjects at address, you would've expected the studio to let the show carry itself with ample amount of silence, enough emotions and the powerful dialogues to do the work. But playing music at every scene eventually drowning the impact of the words hands you the irony of a show about letters and the power of words. It feels amateurish how quickly the piano starts playing accompanied by the violin strings without any concerns to the actual scene and what it tries to convey.\n\nI would go on to say that what Violet lacks of her own, she compensates by showing the characters on the receiving end the feelings behind the letter she writes. And through the act of such unfiltered emotions we get some glimpses to her moments spent with her Major throughout the series. What I would've liked more was the focus on the dynamics between her character and that of her precious companion/support and get their story to be a parallel to the current world she lives in and the different sort of emotions she encounters. \n\nI would like to end this with what I started with, Violet Evergarden is a beautifully dressed up mannequin with no worries of decay and going on for years without any difference to its beauty. Also, never trying to achieve various spectrum of life and content with being \"perfect\" just like how the creators wanted it to be."}, {"id": 3148, "score": 64, "body": "Dear Violet Evergarden:\n\nWith news of your arrival, you managed to rally up our community in a way no upcoming first installment title has before. The way you presented yourself was inviting, enchanting even. Few knew exactly what they were in for, but while not many expected a work as flawed as yourself, they knew to expect something beautiful. Your approach to conveying emotion is interesting, to say the least. Your intentions were rather wonderful: to show someone adjust to life after a war in which her entire existence was predicated towards while trying to understand and convey emotions via letters and experiences in order to understand the last words of someone she loved. You take this robotic husk of a human being, slowly piece her past and how others are affected by said past, and have her grow as a person thanks to the people she encounters and the experiences she has. You showcase the brutality of war and the despair it has on civilians who will never see their loved ones again, all the while showcasing the struggles of adapting to civilization and coping with loss. On paper, it seemed to be a precious concept. While you seem to understand how to convey emotion, how to tie emotional moments together for maximum payoff, and how to truly utilize the audiovisual medium of animation to accentuate every emotional moment, you seem to have a difficult time earning emotional climaxes thanks to your pacing, how you like to spell out how a character, most commonly Violet herself, has grown, and the sheer lunacy you display in occasion. In a way, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re eerily similar to your main character.\n\nYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t entirely lack subtlety per se, but you tend to spell out how Violet or another character has developed after an experience or what one of them is thinking that the audience is supposed to take away from a scene. It is the equivalent of Violet telling people how they are feeling. As they do not like it when she does it, it is bothersome when you do it. I like how you try to clue us into the fate of Violet's beloved major early on, simply with the characters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 pauses, their expressions, and how they try to dodge the issue. If you were more like that, simply letting the visuals convey a character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feelings and what they mean in any given situation, you would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been even more emotionally resonant, especially early on and in the very end.\n\nAnother hindrance to the power of what you convey is how you skip events. For example, in episode 3, Violet enrolls in a program to improve her skills, and by the halfway point, she still cannot convey emotions in her writing, so she fails the course. After one more exercise after an unknown amount of time has passed, after the course is over, she writes a small, satisfactory letter, and automatically passes. Moments like this feel far too sudden, too undercooked, and thus, unearned. Each story is episodic in nature, in that they begin and end by the end of any given episode. With the way you employed this style of writing, you failed to give yourself enough room for some of these stories to play out properly. As such, you resort to nebulous and/or blatant time skips such as a few month time skip in episode 5, which makes everything feel ridiculous and cheap. The progression of Violet herself is not only spelled out to unfortunate degrees, but erratic and unnatural. Her character builds with each interaction, each letter, and each new event she finds herself as a centerpiece of, but the effects feel ill-prepared. It does not feel disingenuous or forced, but it feels awkward and confused at times. The silliness and even stupidity of some of your situations and outcomes make it even harder to take these tear-jerking moments seriously.\n\nViolet is your primary focus, as she is molded by those around her. She is incredibly well-constructed, with every story hand-crafted to tie into her in some way and make her grow as a person and understand emotions and love better than she did before each encounter, even if they sometimes feel like overdone conveniences for the sake of more tears. Additionally, her progression feels awkwardly handled, and as if she grew far too fast too quickly. The time skips make this even more apparent, such as in episodes 3 and 5. It is also a shame that the characters do not click as well as expected. You give us a few entertaining individuals such as Cattleya, but the rest feel less like distinct characters whose plights shake you to your knees, and more like people designed to get violet to grow and relate for the sake of pruning your doughy eyes. This would be fine if everything felt natural, but it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, so the cast, while not inherently bad or weak, are not nearly as impactful as Violet herself. Even the rare comedic moment feels forced, and moments of Violet being blunt are somehow far more amusing. Some of the more asinine moments you showcase are equally hilarious, unintentionally so. At the very least, these side-characters generally do a satisfactory job at what they are intended, so emotional scenes work with them, but there is a surprising lack of chemistry between them and violet, or between each other. Some almost feel like they should never be allowed to interact with certain characters lest they become harder to put up with. Other characters can be borderline laughable or outright pathetic, such as miscellaneous military men in episodes such as 8, or the male tsundere in episode 6. Violet cannot carry the weight of your cast on her own, especially when some do the dolls don't even get their closure, unlike the one-offs.\n\nHowever, as mentioned prior, you have a clear path you intend to tread, and you know exactly how to tie things together, even at the borderline frequent cost of the naturality and subtlety required for you to succeed at your goals. The purposeful irony behind your usage of \u00e2\u0080\u009cdoll\u00e2\u0080\u009d is brilliant, as Violet is described as a doll in a variety of ways, from her job description to her as a person. Each story reveals something new about Violet that causes her to relate to them, such as how she got her name or feeling the warmth of knowing a soldier you care about is alive. These are thinly-veiled, however. They are small, fleeting moments strung together in rapid succession to build without realizing the time there must be set aside or how natural and unspoken the growth must be. Combined with the borderline confusing and barely explored world-building, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ultimately a worse Mahoutsukai no Yome in this regard, and that's a shame given how you weave everything together to piece Violet more and more together each time, and how you utilized its audiovisual strengths to bolster your moments. These moments grow all the stronger, all the more painful in the second half, as things feel much more grounded, well-paced, and devastating on the whole, while the moments of nonsense stopped interfering for the most part, ending entirely excluded.\n\nEvan Call, oft known as someone who composes good music for bad shows, seems to have broken that reputation thanks to you, as he furnishes you, an actually competent show, with a myriad of emotional pieces that compliment their scenes in a satisfactory way. A few pieces stood out, such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cNever Coming Back\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cInconsolable\u00e2\u0080\u009d for being the most emotional of them all, and \u00e2\u0080\u009cTorment\u00e2\u0080\u009d for being the only notable string piece full of violins and cellos. While none of his work here truly rivals his magnum opus \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne More Time\u00e2\u0080\u009d for an inferior show named Chronos Ruler, this is probably the best soundtrack he has composed overall. Where the music he has gifted you truly shines, however, is with the opening: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSincerely\u00e2\u0080\u009d, by TRUE. As one of the best opening of the year and one of the most emotional openings, even songs I have listened to, this song represents everything you hope to achieve and moves me even more than your emotional climaxes do. Your ED theme, \"Michishirube (\u00e3\u0081\u00bf\u00e3\u0081\u00a1\u00e3\u0081\u0097\u00e3\u0082\u008b\u00e3\u0081\u00b9)\" by Minori Chihara, tries a similar approach, but the vocals can downplay the effects of the sad song.\n\nEven with all the grievances I have laid down against you, I cannot deny your beauty. Kyoto Animation worked diligently to craft every scene with luscious detail, with gorgeous, intricate designs, subtle animation movements, and so much more. Even when the light saturation becomes intense at times, those moments have a distinct purpose. Even with the occasionally awkward CGI, it is barely present, so it barely detracts from your beauty. They may have gone overboard in terms of blurring backgrounds for the sake of depth of field, but it does not detract too heavily from what a sight you are to behold. The metallic hands, with all sorts of wonderful coloration, really feel as detailed as a fantastically animated anime film. Even with men that often look far too similar in face, the designs are as beautiful as the women you showcase. It is more than obvious that an immense amount of effort was put into the intricate craftsmanship of your appearance. The directing in some scenes, such as the graveyard scene of episode 8, or the first scene of the first episode, only strengthen the raw emotion being poured out in some of your best scenes. Even with the fight scenes that can only be described as competent, I can barely do justice to how gorgeous you are. Rest assured, as barring borderline insignificant moments and relatively understandable decisions and whatnot, you are one of the best-looking television productions I have ever laid eyes on.\n\nIn some ways, one might consider the hype surrounding you to have been incredibly excessive. In others, many seem to have been truly fulfilled by what you presented. Even with emotionally stunted and borderline laughable moments throughout the early half, in particular, you succeeded at being impactful.

Its starts off as the basic \"Tough guy vs obviously horrible people\" with a lot of gore added on and with a few honorable opponents here and there that either make our protagonist sad or become his temporary allies. But then it devolves into a big bunch of different themes, such as the negative side effects of nuclear power, world war 2, religions, politics, armageddon and whether one's life is worth more than the others.\nI will only be talking spoiler-y about the first chapter or so, and will just talk about the next ones without mentioning anything specific\n\nThis tale follows a man named Riki-Oh who is in jail for murder, in a world where prisons have become private establishments, and the goverment is mostly corrupt. Which allows the creator to completely mistreat the prisoners and other characters without having us, the reader, wonder why its even allowed. The general history behind the character will originally be barely explained, and then slowly built upon as the story progresses. The story itself is cut into 5 different arcs, and they all have their own set main antagonist who Riki-Oh will aim to defeat. All 5 of the arcs reveal more about Riki-Oh, and reveal to him what he must do next.\n\nDuring each arc he will amass one or two allies, which usually will not follow him into the next one, and usually are pretty forgettable and used mostly to get Riki-Oh into trouble or to attempt to hit the reader with an emotional scene or two.\nThe story  suffers from rushing characters other than Riki-Oh. If you're not Riki-Oh then you're just kinda there. They're rarely expanded upon and looked at in any other light other than \"This guy follows the protagonist now\". Characters are also hard to connect to because the series just treats everyone but the main character like the most expendable piece of dirt. \n~~~img400(https://i.imgur.com/6ZRDSIj.png)~~~\n~~~_Pic 1: Riki-Oh showcases his Jewish power alongside his tagline_~~~\n\nThe story itself is somewhat held back by Riki-Oh himself a few times, as he ,despite being a man that is  heroic and strong and eats his greens and all that good protagonist stuff, is very very gullible. There is a lot of times where there is an absolutely obvious trap yet he will walk right into it. Or he'll just play right into the hand of a villain. Villains themselves comment on how easy he is to figure out as he only follows 2 basic principles in his life:\nBe nice and punch the bad.\nUntil they're good or until they're dead.\n\nAnother problematic part of the story is that it...kinda forgets certain plot points. These are mostly a few small plot points introduced early in the story, in the first 2 arcs,when I feel the author himself hasn't fully realised what he wants to do with the series.\nIf people took breaks instead of marathoning the series they would have probably forgotten about them by the time the story finishes so it wouldn't be such a big deal, but I went throught the entire story in 2 days and everything was really fresh when it ended. \n\n~~~img300(https://i.imgur.com/QNF2HJM.png)\n_Pic 2: The story's rather unexpected focus on hebrew tales suprises the man_~~~\n\nThe story is heavily influenced by the Old Testament, the hebrew religion and the treatment of Jews during WW2.It speaks of Solomon,David,Isaac,Abraham and others. I can't attest to how correct the retellings of these tales are as I am not Jewish myself, but I will warn you that the writer confused Austria-Hungary with Africa once so he may not have the best knowledge of history.\n\nThe battles themselves remind me of both JoJo and Fist of the North Star, where you KNOW the main character will win and completely destroy his opponent , but you just have no idea how. Unfortunately for Riki-Oh there is a LOT of \"Filler\" battles,that are basically just the enemy showcasing his abilities and then Riki-Oh destroying them with one or two hits. The \"Non filler\" fights are a joy to read through however, as they usually end with Riki-Oh barely leaving the fight alive because he probably got smacked through several walls and trees in his attempt to find a weakness in the enemy, and do manage to keep you on the edge of your seats.\n\nRiki-Oh also contains 2 side stories that are in no way related to the main story. I recommend skipping the first then coming back to it later,as the first one is positioned right between 2 very intense chapters. The second one is nicely positioned at the end. If you're from Hong Kong then your manga version will not have these, sorry. Don't ask me why, I don't know.\n\nIn short, Riki-Oh is a strange piece that attempts to tackle a large variety of themes in a series thats meant to be mostly just people punching each other till they explode. Its a very interesting read that suffers from the writer abandoning plot points, not really focusing at all on characters other than the protagonist and going into incredibly strange directions that sometimes make it a bit hard to take fully seriously."}, {"id": 3153, "score": 56, "body": "The debate surrounding stereotypes can be found in almost any type of media. Anime is obviously no exception in this regard. Quite the contrary actually (and this might be due to availability heuristics) I find it especially prevalent in this artform. Which brings us straight to the point of this review: The usage of stereotypes (or should I rather call them archetypes?) and their effect on this particular show. \n\nFirst of all I want to focus on the animation. It's not outstanding but definitely has its shining moments. Much more visually captivating is the art though at least on certain occasions. Sure it follows the usual polished stlye that we have all come to accept. But even for that there were some truly great shots in there from the start of episode one right up to the end. \n\nWhen it comes to the bit of story that is actually present I'm by far not the first one to mention the resemblance to \"Roman Holiday\" (just with highschool and club trips) but it's still a concept I was rather intrigued by (especially because you rarely ever see stories with European/Japanese couples). At least in the beginning that is. Unfortunately the story takes some major dips towards the end which really hurts the good build-up in the first half. Unfinished plot-points, unsatisfying pay-off and a lack of consequences make the ending seem rushed and overall unfulfilling. \n\nCharacters on the other hand were quite surprising. This may come as a surprise to many that have watched the show and also to those who have read the summary of this review but I genuinely found the characters interesting. Although they mostly consist of stereotypes they fit surprisingly well together. Contrary to other shows that rely on such \"plot-devices\" it somehow doesn't bother one as much when the typical suspects are introduced like the \"well-spirited and energetic best-friend\" (who is a genuine bro) or the \"tsundere redhead\" just to name a few. It also helps that our main pairing actually features two characters who may seem typical in the beginning but who actually have some sort of deeper motivation (even if they are not that original and deep). Overall I'm rather surprised how the show handled its cast. If you go into this anime with the expectation that no character ever diverges from his/her stereotype then you are in for a few little surprises. \n\nRegarding the soundtrack there is really nothing worth mentioning although I personally enjoyed the OP. It seemed to fit the tone of the show quite nicely. The only real problem (aside from the obvious lack of deeper meaning one shouldn't even realistically expect form this type of show) was the rather heavy foreshadowing that lets you deduct personality and motivations as well as later plot-points immediately. The soundtrack aside from the OP is nothing special. Definitely not something that will stick with you for longer than half a day. \n\nYou might be wondering why I gave this show such a relatively high score. Well, I simply have to admit (as stated above) that despite the really heavy and frequent usage of overused plot-and charater-structures I had quite the fun time with the show. It's main flaw is probably caused by its short length, a problem many seasonal shows face nowadays. In the end the show is decent. Nothing life-changing, nothing cancer-inducing nothing really special but definitely something you can watch when you don't know what else to watch (Fuck the title though). "}, {"id": 3160, "score": 69, "body": "Sword Art Online, here we go. As one of the series that makes me love anime until now, Sword Art Online has become one of the roots of a game, fantasy, and isekai genre. You see that how plentiful and hundreds of shows are made after this anime even takes the same premise with different stories and characters. Or you could just say, some of it consider that some are just plagiarism yet some hate it. I don't want to mention one of the anime but Sword Art Online became a grain from the community who really liked this anime before the internet hated it. This is before Darling in the FranXX, before Log Horizon, before Overlord, before One Punch Man, name anything like overhyped shows that first came from your heads. I also don't think about why I like this anime so much when it was first introduced by my friend along with Accel World. This is the time where I more often playing some video games and didn't know an anime or related to it. So, this is my review on the most overhyped influential show which is often proud of casuals, newbies, fanboys, and even the internet which hate it so much, Sword Art Online.\n\nThe story is inspired by a video games genre called MMORPG and surely, this anime has a big target and audience for gamers. So, this isn't a coincidence that the number of redundant positive responses to this anime has a lot even some of them always refer the main character in this anime as one of the greatest swordsmen ever that ever existed in entire anime instead of Guts from Berserk or name one of your favorite character anime who uses a sword. This is a type of 24 or 25 episode that divided into two cour or arc. The first arc, the main character along with other players, are trapped in an MMO game called Sword Art Online and must complete by completing 100 floors or dungeon through beating the boss from each floor. However, the most interesting point is you die in the game world means you die in the reality. So, this is the point which makes everything more interesting and you think the plot will be unpredictable. But, nope. The first two episodes are actually very good and still follow what the plot introduces. The rest of those points, the story will focus more on that until finally it just falls at the place and feels pointless. Each episode will tell and introduce side characters who seem to have no connection at all and nothing to do with them. Instead of side characters who help along the adventure of the main character like an RPG game, these characters feel just to be the heroine as the harem and I want to state that this is not a \"harem\" anime but the plot does something which it looks like that. It just like a deus ex machina that comes in the right timing, which is in charge of filling in the \"plot\" itself but failing to enter the main story. Not to mention, the romance element that also comes just like that without any development characters are so obviously felt constrained. Another thing that seems good at this point is the development main character at the first arc feels emotional in certain scenes. The second arc is set at a different time and used a time skip. Yes, I think the plot will end up by completing 100 floors but they lie to you. With a few side characters which also become the incest element, the plot turns in an unrealistic way like a hero who tries to save his queen.\n\nAs well as this is typical A-1 Pictures anime, I love the art just like other people said it as well. They really do this as a fantastic and colorful way and the choreography which prevails in the action part is perfect. The portrayal and cinematography that extends through the beautiful scenic of a virtual reality world is also a worth point in this aspect. The character design, the bosses, and the effects make a very beautiful frame whether it's seen from anywhere, it's very clear that this is typical A-1 Pictures anime same as when they made some shounen anime, action, or other genres besides the two genres. It's one of the best so far in this anime and it's worth.\n\nAs with the visuals, the sound in this anime is well really great. The voice actings are decent, I'm sure of it but the soundtrack is just one of the best by Yuki Kajiura. I really like how she always makes the score in the form of a magic touch which matches the scene feels they really are in it such as Fate/Zero, Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u00e2\u0098\u0085Magica, and even Boku dake ga Inai Machi. In addition, the part when it comes to the choir sound is just one that fits perfectly with the action scene. The opening theme songs and ending songs are quite interesting but memorable. Nobody can decide that \"crossing field\" by LiSA is always playing in your heads. \"INNOCENCE\" by Aoi Eir is also like that and I like both songs since the two singers are also my favorite J-pop singers. \"Yume Sekai\" by Haruka Tomatsu and \"Overfly\" by Luna Haruna are also both memorable though not like the two opening theme songs.\n\nAnd now, we are getting more serious because this is the whole worst thing ever besides the story. Kazuto Kirigaya a.k.a. Kirito, a term for OP character that has no weakness at all. He is a typical character that you will never deal with him but you just wanna punch him right in front of his face. He didn't have any development at all because he was strong indeed from the beginning of his introduction. He was the most perfect character that ever existed, all the heroines are loved him whether they are, a villain who was very jealous because his presence suddenly became afraid and sometimes became his friend, and one of the characters who were specialists in everything either hackers, playboys, gamers, anything. Asuna Yuuki, a typical character that I think is one of the coolest introductions ever in this anime but the development of her Tsundere character crap makes it blatant yet one of the waifuable characters. Since her meeting with Kirito, I think that she really dependent on Kirito and it makes her a useless character especially when it reaches the second arc. Who the hell cares about the other supporting characters both the heroine and the male character but we'll discuss a little about Suguha Kirigaya. I discussed this character because she is who replaced Asuna as another main heroine regardless of Asuna's existence. Yeah, it's just an incest romance sub-plot that some people also care about but you don't really give a little thing. Yui is a typical character that just like that. Well, she is a character. Yeah, a character. A deus ex machina character that seems to ruin an RPG genre and whatever storyline make it one of the worst characters in this anime. It's like the ending of Clannad: After Story which I hate it so much, this type of character feels like you are laughed at and you feel bad at them. Jokes that make the whole story and characters become pointless.\n\nAlthough there are some people who hate this anime just because the internet also hates it and as if making them cool because they hate something popular, they don't seem to have an opinion to tell and have no obvious reason why they hate it. Well, this show has a lot of potential and influence from its successors to make this anime a pioneer of everything. Sure, before Sword Art Online, there were various anime which discussed an RPG before. A few of cancer fanboys, a hater also the same as well, but it just one of the enjoyable and generic shows, I admit. I also don't know how many times I watch this anime just because some those features I consider good make me almost forgot with the storyline and characters itself. Sword Art Online is a show that feels solid and generic despite the many pointless scenes and aspects included in this anime. The pace is always in balanced, sometimes slow and sometimes fast so it doesn't feel boring to enjoy all the story elements. So yeah, this is one of the shows that you don't need to enjoy without consuming a lot of ideas or you can enjoy with your eyes being closed. What's more, this is my first anime to make me love anime and made me watch more anime again.\n\nSword Art Online is an overhyped, overrated, overpraised show all times. There are many fans and communities who really like this terrible solid show which feels forced in terms of story. There is no development of character at all, including the main characters who have no weaknesses. The first one and two episode are great, introduces a simple premise and an interesting plot but fails at the whole story. The romance is just coming out like that and has no specific explanation about it. The music and the animation are all but closed with thousands of pointless stuff in this anime. This is one of the typical shows that first, you initially liked but you will also hate in the next few years."}, {"id": 3161, "score": 55, "body": "img(https://i.imgur.com/TCtd4iM.jpg)\n~~~*Rokuhara*~~~\n\n*Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya o Mezasu* (*Shoujo-tachi* for short) is an anime made to promote a visual novel by the same name. The anime is about six high school students forming a group (called *Rokuhara*) to make a visual novel. This anime's plot shares a lot with the one in *Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata* (*Saekano*). This anime isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a rip-off of *Saekano* though, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a different take on a similar plot. There are many roadblocks in the way of the development of their game, many of them that also get in the way of the viewer liking the anime. I'll explain what I mean later, for now, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll introduce the characters:\n\n**Buntarou Houjou**\nimg(https://i.imgur.com/EWQ7GWc.jpg)\nBuntarou Houjou (more commonly called Bunta) is the main character of the anime. He ends up being the writer for *Rokuhara* after Kuroda sees his talents as a scriptwriter for the school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Drama Club. He often gets writer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s block, but nevertheless is a hard worker.\n\n**Sayuki Kuroda**\nimg(https://i.imgur.com/pWcn5ww.jpg)\nSayuki Kuroda is the leader and producer for *Rokuhara*. Kuroda is the person who comes up with the plan to make a visual novel, recruiting Bunta (who recruits the others to join). She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite socially inept, leading her to be overly frank and condescending when she shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be. Kuroda is into Bishoujo games and is an otaku. She develops feelings for Bunta in the anime as the episodes go on.\n\n**Yuuka Kobayakawa**\nimg(https://i.imgur.com/W7lQ0OH.jpg)\nYuuka Kobayakawa is Bunta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s childhood friend and the Voice Actress for *Rokuhara*. She is in the Drama Club and is generally known as a great actress in that circle. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very bubbly and the most outgoing of all of *Rokuhara*. She also expresses feelings for Bunta later in the anime, perhaps noticing the threat of Kuroda or the other girls.\n\n**Teruha Andou**\nimg(https://i.imgur.com/x0qSVSR.jpg)\nTeruha Andou is the programmer for *Rokuhara*. She also works part-time at a maid caf\u00c3\u00a9 and helps on her family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fishing ship. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a loud person and often thinks before saying or doing, causing friction between her and others in *Rokuhara*. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s open about her obsession with anything BL, which creeps out everybody else in the group at least once.\n\n**Uguisu Yuuki**\nimg(https://i.imgur.com/nRlwbTu.jpg)\nUguisu Yuuki is the artist for *Rokuhara*. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the top artists on Pixi(v) and is probably the most talented of all of the people in *Rokuhara*. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very shy and has problems speaking up as a result. She has the tendency to overwork herself to the point of becoming sick.\n\n**Atomu Kai**\nimg(https://i.imgur.com/uX2blWN.jpg)\nAtomu Kai is the assistant director for *Rokuhara* and the only other male in the group and is also Bunta's other childhood friend. He has the appearance of a \u00e2\u0080\u0098nice guy\u00e2\u0080\u0099, but hates the term because being one has been his downfall with women in the past. He has an intense hate for \u00e2\u0080\u0098normies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 which fuels his passion to make a visual novel. He doesn't have a specific talent, so he mostly does busywork.\n\nAs I was saying earlier, *Shoujo-tachi* is an anime that has a lot of melodramatic points. I'm not going to spoil any of them, but a lot of them were unnecessary in my opinion. Of course, an anime needs to have some conflict to make it interesting, but the way that *Shoujo-tachi* does it is poorly executed. It also makes some of the supporting characters unlikable in some parts of the anime. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult to fit the plot of a 20-30 hour long visual novel to a 4 hour long anime, but I think there has to be a better way of doing it. A lot of these plot points come off as \u00e2\u0080\u0098forced drama\u00e2\u0080\u0099, as much as I hate to use that term. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drama for the sake of it. Most of the drama (especially towards the end) isn't really resolved in a good way either. Guess you'll have to buy the visual novel to have an actual conclusion to it.\n\nThe characters themselves are alright. As I said above, there are some points in the anime that made me slightly dislike characters (at least for a bit). I know that characters shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be perfect, but the way that these characters are shown to have imperfections is very annoying. A lot of this anime, especially the latter half, is annoying. That being said, I didn't hate any of the characters I do like some of them, like Kuroda. I'm sure there are enough characters for you to find at least one that you like the most.\n\n*Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya o Mezasu* isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a bad anime, but it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a good one either. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sort of mixed on what to think of it since I believe that the anime had a great potential to be better. The anime had too much unnecessary drama in it. Perhaps that drama is better explained and brought out in the visual novel, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just drama for the sake of drama in the anime. It seriously hinders the plot as time goes on. Between this anime and *Saekano*, I would rather watch *Saekano* since I like the characters better than the ones in *Shoujo-tachi*. That being said, this anime isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t unwatchable, so if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re into *Saekano*, I would recommend you this."}, {"id": 3162, "score": 65, "body": "What happens if you decide to turn you D&D campaign into an anime, well you would kinda end up with Record of Lodoss War. From the first episode it just screams D&D, starting with the characters and their stereotypes. And continuing on with the story and the way things developed throughout. Unfortunately for it, I feel like the show tried to create a world and story larger than it had the space to use. Often you have entire fights against massive monsters and villains occurring in 5 minutes at the end of the episode, with character development occurring in small short almost disconnected moments scattered throughout. \n\nThe first episode I feel captured what I would have wanted the best, it seemed to set up a clear goal of escaping the caves. Set up the characters and some quick character traits and showed off who they are. And wrapped the whole thing up with a satisfying final battle of the episode. It all just felt really tight and solid, something I don't feel like the rest of the show ever captured for me. \n\nThe show sets up multiple villains and a rather large cast of evil characters, and gives them all a surprisingly large amount of development. They all seem to have goals and motivations, or at least most of them. The final villain I feel like had a rather weak and for me, slightly confusing reason for doing what he was doing. In many ways I feel like the villains were gifted with more development than the good guys.\n\nOn the side of good, or light as is mentioned many times. The cast is large and fits all the roles you would expect to find in a well rounded D&D party. With the leader being inexperienced new knight Parn, who is being championed as the new Hero. And as the story progresses, you watch the Hero grow as a swordsman until he is strong enough to defeat the main villain, so pretty standard stuff. Outside of the Hero, the other character that received a surprising amount of development was the elderly Dwarf. On a personal quest to save his savior, who just happens to align nicely with the Hero's quest. A section I wish got more development was the romance between Parn and the love interest Deed, who is the High Elf and becomes a major importance later on. Moments of romance and development between the two appear, and leads to the appearance of a relationship, but nothing ever seems to develop further really.\n\nQuick mention of animation and art style, well it was decent. Nothing amazing or incredible really, but all of it good enough and constant that it never looked strange or cheap. Outside of some strange moments when things didn't move in ways you would expect, and ended up looking a bit fake. But overall it was of good quality. \n\nThe highest point for me would have to be the Sound and Music. Man I loved all of it, with the OP and ED being great and never getting tired or boring for me. Various musical pieces fit into the world very well, and when applied helped to boost the scene and whatever was occurring on screen. "}, {"id": 3164, "score": 63, "body": "Sword Art Online is admittedly said as one of the anime that has the most errors of its own and somehow becomes a pop culture in anywhere. I just don't know what the magnum opus of the author, Reki Kawahara, though is. Does he know much about a story, a video game, or whatever? And the most complex question in this anime is, did we need the second season? Well, I also didn't know that this is one of the most anticipated anime at the time as well as me too. Everyone anticipated until it spilled out and I'm also like that. From what I understand, I think Sword Art Online II has no relationship or anything in terms of stories or anything related. That only happens unless the story which it showed in this anime isn't much different, even worse. So, this is my review of Sword Art Online II.\n\nThis second season seems like to have much random stuff starting from the story and the characters recognition. But, we'll take some good parts and throw away the garbage. Now, I'm just afraid of how the fanbase is known for its brutality which can't understand or understand someone's opinion. In fact, I saw many AniTubers reviewing this series but I just can't stand with the comment section. So, the first thing I would emphasize is this is just an \"opinion.\" Opinion is just an opinion no matter if some people agree with it or not. So, the story is set after the event in Sword Art Online. The main character, Gary Stu, and his friends just found a new incident in a virtual reality PvP game called Gun Gale Online or GGO. A player who calls himself \"Death Gun,\" or I should just say the Darth Vader wannabe (because there are several references including lightsabers), appears to kill well-known players by shooting them in-game. Gary Stu was recognized to play the game and investigate the murder. As with the first season, Sword Art Online II is divided into two arcs: GGO arc and Mother's Rosario arc (which the second arc is the most promising in this series but fails for several reasons). First of all, I'm just surprised if this anime knew for or isn't serious in responding to a murder case. I just don't know that a young teenager who always playing video games is assigned to a murder investigation in a video game which it just has a ridiculous or dumb impression. Let me fix the problem. Because he is the main character, he is Gary Stu. So, he once again held on the stage and met one heroine he hired to join Kirito's harem club. That's just excessive but it's real. So, this heroine is Shino Asada a.k.a. Sinon and I wanna just admit that she is one of the cool introducing characters. She has enough role in this arc, has a tragic background, and most importantly, she also has a feeling towards Kirito. Well, what do you expect? By the way, this arc was also introduced with the Kirito's avatar became a woman and acted like a cute woman thing as well for just no apparent reason whatsoever. We don't care about other characters because they are only cameos which just pass through in the story. Did I say, story? No, what I mean is they just cameo as Alfred Hitchcock, the master of suspense, always did in his every movie. That is just unnecessary.\n\nThe second arc is the best from all, saddest, and most emotional in this anime. As usual, Sinon, who originally focused on her character, got a decent portion of various characters which could be said to be well-developed just to become other same heroines as well. And all the other heroines be like,\n\n\"Hey Sinon, join us with this club. We'll always be together and will remain next to Kirito-kun. We will hang-out together while talking cool stuff about Kirito-kun and be fantasize about making love with him.\"\n\n- Signed, all rejected heroines\n\nJust like all the doujinshi which you always read it and you certainly know what would happen next. There are some things that I consider good from this season and the answer is, Kirito isn't the main character but is Asuna. So, what do we think about her? She was so useless after meeting Kirito and my impression feel left on her character which I thought she was the coolest character ever, just from her introduction. However, Asuna is so different in this series as there is a magic talent from the author. She isn't Mary Sue and we'll be introduced with Yuuki Konno a.k.a. Zekken, the main character and main point in this arc. Although it's not like Mary Sue who is also able to defeat Kirito in a PvP duel arena, she isn't an OP character but you have sympathy for her character, emotional depth about her circumstances, and her purpose of why she playing ALO. This is one of the heartbreaking stories and it works in both the character development, just like Sachi as the plot device for Kirito in the first season. But, my problem with this arc there is no connection whatsoever. I don't know why this arc, Yuuki Konno, and his friends were quickly introduced. In addition, this arc is also forgettable because it has no relationship to the main points of the story. But, it's not wrong if this arc also exists because I admit this is the perfect frame of this second season. Like I said, throw away the trash and take the valuable ones.\n\nThe animation is quite the same as well as the first season. I have the same opinion for the animation and visuals, especially in the first arc which seems dystopian to the GGO world. My issue is the opening theme songs which really tells much and clear spoilers regardless of the song which is also as good and memorable as the first season. At least, A-1 Pictures still gives the best in this aspect and it works quite well at this point. I also have to emphasize this if they also like Sinon's ass more than anything. Not Asuna, Suguha with her milky tits, or other heroines. They really liked Sinon's ass beyond anything.\n\nLike the animation, the sounds are pretty good by the way. The sound effect which also sounds to the small detail is just awesome and Yuki Kajiura still takes a part in the music and the soundtrack which just works well as the first season. The opening theme songs such as \"IGNITE\" by Eir Aoi and \"courage\" by Haruka Tomatsu are great and memorable which I like to hear over and over because it's pretty catchy. \"Startear\" by Luna Haruna is same as well, along with \"No More Time Machine\" and \"Shirushi\" by LiSA.\n\nFor all the characters, I think is just the same as the first season. All the support characters both main heroines, other heroines, and other characters adore Kirito as their God. I mean, Kirito only exist in the first arc with Sinon's well-development character but just like other heroines, Sinon isn't a special character in this series. She has a tragic background, I admit, being betrayed, and some other emotional stuff except she shouldn't have a feeling towards Kirito. Yuuki Konno is a character who doesn't have any reason to fill up the main story. The arc is easily forgotten and not too serious so it only becomes a part of the next season. But, she is the most emotional and heartbreaking character arc of all. Her first introduction, I bet, is so annoying but that is if someone hides the tragic background with her smile. Her relationship with Asuna was also very dramatic especially when approaching the climax, she was invited to go to the outside world with Kirito and ended with happiness thing ever that she had never forgotten. This arc is like riding on a train which runs very fast. It's too fast if you say a plot because it's just done like there's nothing more to tell for the last episode.\n\nUntil this step, is Sword Art Online II really worth it and sounds nice? Do we really need a second season? It just depends on you because this is no different than a decent show but with a different title. Or, another term is a spin-off because I don't see any connection between the first season. The second arc is the most pointless because it just comes out of nowhere which you can't describe what is the most relevant feeling when watching it. The show has a pace which is on balanced but for some reason, I begin to appreciate the first season rather than the second season. Not too bad but the first season takes the whole cake for the entire series. This is just according to my opinion. Some people like it because of this or that, but they also hate it for any reason.\n\nSword Art Online II isn't the whole mess up but it's bad when comparing to the first season. It makes no difference with the first series, which is the same. Some of the specific scenes also make us heartfelt and heartbreaking but in this anime, it only takes place in an instant way. The character recognition is easily forgotten and just thrown away from there. In fact, the appearance from the beginning was so well-development without anyone interrupting their characters. As always, this is just an opinion because I'm so afraid of how to deal with one of its hardcore. In various aspects, this anime also doesn't have a heavy theme where you can enjoy it without a loop. Sword Art Online has nothing to do with the whole story and the characters but the art and the music are great, by the way."}, {"id": 3166, "score": 55, "body": "-SPOILERS-\n\n\nHello people, today I am gonna talk about the bald guy's \"hentai\" if you can call it like that, because that guy is a \"monk\" which is supposed not to fuck with girls, but he says \"Before a monk, I AM A MAN\", that's his main tagline, the anime starts with this guy finding his chilhood friend who was in love with him, so they go to kind of motel and they fuck hard \"ah you can't do this cause you are a monk\" -\"BUT BEFORE A MONK I AM A MAN\" and they keep fucking the whole anime.\n\nNow here is my opinion, the anime characters are good, but the problem here is the plot, because it is so predictable that he is gonna fuck her the whole anime and that is bad, if, for example, his boss would've find them and after taking a look he decided to join them and have a fun night but then they would have cum on the girl and the girl would've got pregnant then they had a bald child, then that would have been a 10 anime, but it was so boring so because that I give it a 55 points out of 100\n\nI am gonna talk about the animation now, It is pretty good to be a short anime but there are things that even if it is a short anime it need some improvements, for example, the girl whose name I don't remember (I am gonna call her Sugusputana) was a orange head girl, but her personality was so bad, the girl knew that the man was a monk and he could not fuck but she did let him fuck her which is so bad, because now his life is ruined and he can not work, so eventualy he will come a homeless person, and all is that because that fucking sugusputana, so if the girl would not have done that that poor monk which before a monk he is a man would not have broken his sect rules and he could have fed his mouth and not become a homeless person which goes with a dog in the street omg, that story is so sad, poor bald guy, and because that i recommend that anime because it is the saddest anime I have watched ever.\n\nThat's my review guys, I hope you have enjoyed it because it is my first review and I don't know how to do it well, and before going I have to say: The bald guy was not guilty, the sugusputana girl was the problem in that anime and it that girl were not in this anime, it would not have been so sad, so both, the girl and the boy are good.\n\nHave a good day guys, I love you."}, {"id": 3167, "score": 55, "body": "# What I did not like\nWe're just gonna start right off the bat with what I didn't like about the show. I feel like they kept using the same jokes over and over, and it got stale. For example, Yui being lazy and Ui being responsible. While it was funny the first time around, Yui had annoyingly little character development because of it. Yui never learned how to practice on her own until the last few episodes, and by then an entire year had passed and they already had a new member, Azusa. They used Yui being lazy as a silly joke and we ended up being annoyed with this character almost the entire season. I genuinely wanted her to grow and to learn how she personally deals with it, and she never does. Also, when Azusa joins, she comments on how unproductive everyone is being. And while their joke following that was funny the first time, they make the same joke _over and over again_. It was annoying, and it was boring. For the entire episode poor Azusa doesn't know what to do, and I'm just annoyed at every other character for messing around so much. \"But that's the joke\" you say, \"they're supposed to be annoyingly unproductive\". Yeah, and it was funny. The first time they did it. Then they made the same joke again. And then again. And again. It distracted from the plot, yet it was completely unnecessary. What makes all that worse is that despite how little they actually get to practicing and how much of a joke they make their not practicing, they try to make their concerts come off as a fulfilling moment for them all, and tell us \"wow, look how much they grew as people!\" But I just don't feel it. The show distracted from all the work they should've been doing and turned it into a joke. In other words, the show itself is just as bad as what the characters were doing. Their supposedly fulfilling moments just didn't feel as fulfilling as they should've been, and would've been if the show had treated the build-up to that moment seriously.\n\nOn the same topic of those concerts not being fulfilling, I have a note on episode 6's concert. I don't really like how they switch to \"music video mode\" when they perform their song. While it looks nice and all, I would much rather see them performing the song themselves. It would've been much nicer to see them playing their hearts out, and to see their \"hard work\" actually paying off. But there is something bigger about episode 6 I want to say. I don't know if it counts as a spoiler so I'll just be safe.\n~!In this episode, at the end of the concert, Mio trips and exposes her panties to the audience.!~ Now, this being completely out of character for the show and total unnecessary fan service is not what gets me mad about it. What makes me mad is that they had the perfect opportunity for some character development right there, but they skipped it in favor of a stupid joke. That moment was never referenced again except later on, for a silly gag. While Mio is adorable, it's not enough to distract me from how pointless this whole thing is. Here's an alternative that I think would've been better for the show. Mio does trip, without the fan service. Instead of getting right back up and this being used as a joke later, her friends help her up, and they laugh about it together. Mio finally overcomes her fear of performing in front of others, and laughs too. Then everyone is happy, and this moment that they've built up to over multiple episodes actually has payoff. And what's great is that earlier in the episode __they even provide the foundation for something like this to happen__. Earlier, before the show, Mio jokingly hits Ritsu. Ritsu gets hurt of course, but then everyone starts laughing about it. Eventually Ritsu even laughs about it. This was a wholesome moment for everyone, good scene. But then they do nothing with the development from that scene. By the way, that whole scene was about what they were going to do at the concert. Again, build-up for the concert that had disappointingly low payoff. __They gave themselves the opportunity for something great, yet completely skipped over it in favor of a stupid joke only referenced one other time__. This was supposed to be a big moment for the characters. It was supposed to be one of the big challenges they were supposed to overcome together, but it was ruined by a dumb gag. There are lots of other examples of missed opportunities, but I feel like this is the biggest one.\n\nAnd one more thing. I feel like things just kind of work out for the characters. For example, Mugi's family happens to own the music shop, and is also rich. They made everyone start working part-time jobs to help Yui pay for her dream guitar, but in the end it was all rendered completely useless when we found out Mugi can do literally everything. Almost an entire episode (of the 13 episode series) was dedicated to Yui's friends helping her get enough money, including Mugi doing a part-time job. But they went into the store again and we find out all of that was completely useless and Mugi had enough money the entire time, and also everyone worships her. And she also has multiple villas on the beachside with expensive equipment perfect for training camps. This is a really cheap way to progress the story.\n\n# What I liked\nNow, despite everything I just said, the show does have some good bits. For example, Yui and Ui's relationship. It's cute. Ui's probably my favorite character, next to Azusa. There were some genuinely wholesome moments that I actually loved between them. Another thing: Azusa is a good character. I feel like her journey through the last few episodes was great, even if it was slightly rushed. It was enjoyable. Also, the CGI. The CG guitars were executed perfectly I think. They blended it really well with the 2D animation, and it wasn't distracting in the slightest. The intro and outro were nice too, even if the outro is a little weird and out of character. Maybe it makes sense in the second show, who knows. One last thing, I liked the ending. The show did a good job of making us feel like the characters did go through a lot of hardship and growth. I'm about to spoil a small bit of the ending to explain this point.\n~!When all of the characters ended up playing just for fun, I really liked it. What used to be (supposedly) tough for them to do, they were now doing just because they liked it.!~ I feel like this was executed well.\n\n# Closer\nI know I'm actually in the minority of people who didn't like it, so some feedback would be nice. I will be watching the second series so I can have an opinion on that. Plus I enjoyed the show enough to at least try the second season. Peace, everybody."}, {"id": 3170, "score": 52, "body": "As we all know, CoMix Wave Films' is famed for the international hit, _Your Name._, known as the highest-grossing anime film of all time. Having loved that film, I was naturally drawn in by the trailer of _Flavours of Youth_ which sort of gave off similar vibes -- it felt nostalgic, poignant, and looked damn good. I was, however, very...VERY disappointed.\n\nI'm going to divide this film a lot and talk about its separate parts since it's very inconsistent with its quality.\n\n*Minor spoilers ahead -- beware!*\n____\n~~~img800(https://d1xfgk3mh635yx.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/original/public/image/featured/1046824-netflix-unveils-new-trailer-poster-flavors-youth.jpg?itok=-ypeD8jc)~~~\n____\n\n# Story: 3.0\n\nThis film's broken up into 3 parts. \"Fun\" fact: this was also used in _5 Centimetres per Second_, a film also by CoMix Wave Films. Difference is that each one focuses on a separate character and their stories...and it's a bit more boring.\n\n__Part 1 (1/10)__ : To put it bluntly, the first 15 minutes or so was nothing but straight-up food porn. Its attempt at depicting a fond recollection of past times failed in every sense to give off a strong, tangible sense of nostalgia. Its \"hopeful\" conclusion had nothing to back it up...you know why? Well, get this -- there's no plot! Absolutely nothing happened. It was just one shitty flashback (the whole movie is a flashback, but this one is just especially bad). On top of that, the narration was unnecessary, and the overall execution was a mess and plain weak, not that the concept was anything new. But god DAMN...those were the prettiest fucking noodles I've ever seen.\n\n__Part 2 (2/10)__ : I guess this was an improvement from the first, mostly because there was a plot this time. This story centres around a once seemingly talent-less woman now a modelling sensation hailed at the top. It more or less felt like a shitty teen movie -- some nice, pretty brunette is the most popular and beloved girl at her \"school\"...until some blonde-haired bitch comes in and steals her thunder (in this case, pink hair...gotta love anime). After that, it's all about her little sister and how she wants to support her and protect her and all that lovely, generic jazz...to be honest, I don't remember what happened at all -- this was very forgettable.\n\n__Part 3 (6/10)__ : Hooray! We've hit the only decent part of this movie! It has plot! It has emotions! Oh, my! Unfortunately, this was pretty much a copy-and-paste of the whole plot from _5 Centimetres per Second_ except with a much different ending (~~HINT: Makoto Shinkai doesn't direct this film. What a sad man.~~). That being said, this was fine. This time, the story revolves around man who's reminded of a forgotten would-be love, along with him telling of his following regrets. As the best portion of the film, it actually gives off some sense of nostalgia -- something that the first part horribly failed to do. I genuinely felt bad for the main character, even though I've seen similar instances in other (better) anime many times before. In general, it's a good example of how a recycled plot can be executed fairly well through decent character work and direction. ~!SPOILER (kind of): The ending and after-credits scene made me smile, and that was the only time I did.!~\n\nAll in all, the story was bad. If the film had been more consistent with the first half being as good as the second, then I would've definitely seen this film in a different and much more positive light. At least Part 3 was something that was even slightly worth watching. Just _barely_.\n____\n# Visuals: 9.0\n\nHOLY SHIT. THE NOODLES.\n~~~img800(https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/857/43173537004_35749573e5_z.jpg)~~~\nOK. It's common knowledge that CoMix Wave makes some pretty-ass films, and this movie is certainly no exception. The first 15 minutes would make any foodie climax. BUT...why does everything have to look way nicer than it needs to be? I mean...I'm all for good animation, but this is just getting out of hand! I get the feeling that it's trying way too hard, putting more effort into the animation than the rest of the movie. Not every scene needs a blurry border or countless lens flares! I don't need to look at some pixel-perfect water droplet magnificently plopping into a house sink! Just give me some plot! I want to see something happen!\n\n~~~img800(https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1776/42082699120_d9bc448c9d_z.jpg)~~~\n\nIn all seriousness, this movie is -- visually -- absolutely stunning. Just put some more meaning into the pretty landscapes next time!\n____\n# Audio: 8.0\nAgain, as usual with CoMix Wave Films, they've got some great background music. For some reason, I found the credits song to be especially good (I was jammin' to that shit, I dunno why). However, it feels as if they think that music is the only way to convey any sort of emotion. As I said earlier with the animation, more effort is put into background music than the actual plot itself, and hopefully this doesn't become commonplace within future films made by them. While the sound effects, ambience, and music was great throughout the whole film, using the OST to strengthen a scene's impact will only work under an well-established foundation along with good context. Unfortunately, this was nowhere to be seen in Part 1, and the second part's attempt was lacklustre. I think you've got the point by now that the third is better than the other two in every way possible.\n____\n# Character: 2.0\n\n~~~img260(https://www.goombastomp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/dd13625cf6e4a522ff3e04054ffb8766-1024x544.png) img250(http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2018/07/model-720x405.jpg) img250(https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/07/11/flavorsofyouth-1531352347718_1280w.jpg)~~~\n\nThere really isn't much to these characters at all. The first character wasn't exactly relatable due to the \"plot\" being so messy. The woman in Part 2 is the typical overly-confident, big sister type of gal. The third guy, despite having the best plot, wasn't anything special either, as well as his friends. You've probably noticed that I haven't mentioned their names at all, and for good reason -- I don't remember. Nothing memorable about them. I can't say they're realistic either since other than some of their life experiences which may be plausible, their personalities are so bland that it's hard to believe.\n____\n# Enjoyment: 4.0\nTo be completely honest, the first two parts were incredibly boring. I mean, it doesn't really help that nothing happened for the first 15 minutes. Once the second part hit, I was half asleep, not that this transition became anything exciting, either. This is definitely up there as one of the dullest 45 minutes of any movie I've ever seen, and I've watched some pretty shitty movies. The only enjoyment I received during the time was the sexy-ass food and laughing at how extra the visuals were at times. As for the rest of the movie, I liked it...but to an extent. The second half was the only part that triggered some sort of reaction in me, ranging from a soft and sudden *\"oh\"* to a slightly louder *\"oh, shit\"*.\n____\n~~~img800(https://readysteadycut.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Shanghai_bamensha_0132567.png)~~~\n____\n# Final Verdict\n\nWith all into consideration, this film was \"meh\" at best. I couldn't say that this had much potential either when it's solely powered by gorgeous animation, beautiful music, and not much else. Its cast is bland and forgettable. Its plot in Part 1 and 2 is weak and sloppy, and Part 3 doesn't add much more as a mere copy-and-paste of a movie that's only decent. Its attempt at emitting a similar-but-different emotional prowess as \"Your Name.\" terribly failed for the majority, but at least did a better job towards the end.\n\nEven though it scored a 52/100 (D-), on a 1-10 scale, I'd give _Flavours of Youth_ a __4/10 (\u00e2\u009c\u0098 Subpar)__. If you liked _5 Centimetres per Second_, you'll like the second half (Part 3) of this film. The first half (Part 1/2) isn't worth watching for anybody at all. Except for the food. That was glorious. Fuck, I can't stop thinking about it...\n___\n___\n~~~<h1><b>\u00e2\u009c\u0098 4/10 -- SUBPAR \u00e2\u009c\u0098\n\n=== NOT RECOMMENDED ===</b></h1>~~~\n___\n___"}, {"id": 3188, "score": 60, "body": "Inspiration can be a fickle thing. The muses may guide our hearts towards a particular passion, but they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always stick around to see us through it. As a child, Kousei Arima felt a natural attraction to the piano. He could play music by ear, was a gifted mimic, and had boat loads of potential to one day dominate the instrument. With the help and encouragement of a family friend, Kousei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mom set him on his desired path, but life as a pianist was harder than he thought. Rather than playing for fun and expressing himself through music, she wanted him to be able to make a living through his music, so she went as hard on her little pianist as possible, going as far as to beat and abuse him if he underperformed or tried to play a piece in his own way. By the time the terminal illness she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d hid from him took it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s toll on her, his passion was gone, replaced with the cold, robotic delivery of one who could deliver a piece perfectly, but found no more joy in doing so. He lost his mother, along with his ability to hear the notes he was playing.\n\nTwo years later and about three feet taller(I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll GET to that), Kousei still tinkers around with the piano, but hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t played it seriously, to the chagrin of all who enjoyed his work, or just hate to see him so incomplete. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at this point, like all down-trodden men who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve lost their luster for life, that along comes that one girl to bring color back into his world. Her name is Kaori Miyazono, and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a violinist who cares nothing for rules or convention, finding childish but somehow wise joy in every aspect of life, and with this one chance meeting, Kousei finds a new muse\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 A capricious, cheerful beauty whose revisionist musical performances instantly connect with the crowds she plays for, and whom seems singularly obsessed with performing alongside Kousei, and helping him to relaunch the career that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d so recently abandoned. But her dedication to helping him to overcome his tragedy hides a secret tragedy of her own, and one simple lie she told back in April will live on to define their relationship as they change each others lives through mutual inspiration.\n\nI haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen everything that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been produced by A-1 pictures, but I honestly can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember seeing anything they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done that looked outright bad. Sure, Sword Art Online and From the New world looked a little sloppy at times, resorting to broken character models to show fluid motion at reduced costs, but if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the worst they can do, then they could do a lot worse. They seem to take a lot of care with their work, putting an admirable amount of effort into quality control, like letting a low budget get the better of them would be an insult to their pride or something, and if that observation is correct, then I like the way they think. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve noticed that they generally have a penchant for putting a lot of energy into special effects, and then using just enough budget saving tricks to compensate without going overboard or letting it become noticeable. Key frames are well drawn and pleasing to the eye, and they feature a little more than just flapping mouths, with occasional shifts in posture to keep the characters expressive.\n\nOf course, there don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to be special effects in a show about musicians, right? Wrong. Not only are special textures like water given special treatment, but we often get visual representations of the emotions brought out by a piece of music, which use environmental and 3D effects to keep our attention during the sequence, especially towards the end when Kousei and Kaori are playing together in a fantasy sequence, and the camera liberally revolves around a beautifully 3D animated piano. The characters also have a lot of inner monologuing that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shown to us in artistic fashion, reminiscent of His and Hers Circumstances, but what I found the most impressive was the actual animation of the characters playing their instruments on stage. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t confirm this, but I have heard from a few people that A-1 pictures used a technique similar to rotoscoping, and I feel no justification for doubting this rumor, as every movement of the performing musicians, from fingers on the keys to the way the bow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movements perfectly matches the music of the violin.\n\nIt would be so easy to get away with having a still image on screen while only the performers arms moved, and more intense note being played offscreen while only the audience\u00e2\u0080\u0099s frozen faces of adoration are showcased, but as I said, that would be an insult to A-1. Kousei, Kaori and several others put their entire bodies into their performances, losing themselves in it, and you feel every drop of their adrenaline. Character designs are beautifully polished and easy on the eyes, with it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only major departure from reality being that the musician characters look a little more distinctive and exuberant than non-musicians, like Kousei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friends. Well, okay, there is one other unrealistic detail that bothered me a bit\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The difference in height between 14 year old characters and themselves at 12 is fucking insane. My jaw dropped when they said that Kousei quit the piano at 12, because he was so short that when he sat on the bench his feet didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even touch the ground. I could have sworn he was, like, 6 or something. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my only real issue with the visuals, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a pretty jarring one.\n\nThe music of the series\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Do I even have to say it? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a series about musicians, and you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do something like that if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the knowledge or resources to pull it off, and they seriously pulled it off. Not only is it full of classical music, you can tell the difference in the way these pieces are being played, and the music that is meant to inspire and astound people does exactly that to the audience as well as the characters. From what I gather, Yuna Shinohara, a decorated Japanese violinist who was only 21 at the time, played the music for Kaori, and her wealth of training and experience did not go to waste. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find as much information on Eriko Kawachi, who played all of the piano pieces, which is unfortunate. The show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actual soundtrack was composed by Masaru Yokoyama, and while it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as memorable or powerful as the character-based performances, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still solid and well-orchestrated, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a shame it gets overlooked in favor of the insert tunes.\n\nThe English dub was produced by Aniplex, and features a lot of newer actors from this decade, alongside a few industry veterans. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to say these newcomers step up and use this show as a platform to make a name for themselves, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be stretching the truth a bit, mostly on account of the many loops that Your Lie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s text throws them for. Their performances were not consistent, which is a direct result of their material not being consistent, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really think it was fair for them to be thrown into something this eclectic. For the most part, they do a fine job voicing the characters while nothing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really happening. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just characters talking to each other, sounding like natural teenagers going about their lives. Where they really shine is during dramatic scenes, and ho boy are there a lot of dramatic scenes in this anime. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of pain, insecurities, confusion, all of that fun adolescent stuff, but with a much harsher but still believable edge to it once you realize the kind of real life circumstances that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re dealing with.\n\nWhile some of these issues may be worthy of an eyeroll from the viewer\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Most of the characters who are in love with Kousei fall into this category\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going through issues that you probably had to deal with as well, and you can scoff at it from your seat as a grown up, or laugh at how silly it is for this obvious harem to try and be something more, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re feeling something you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve felt at some point, whether you remember it or not, and they damn well make you feel it. The exception, where several otherwise amazing actors begin to falter\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Is with the gag humor, when the characters go SD Chibi for exaggerated reactions, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think they were ready to transition the specific roles they were playing into it. Max Mittelman, for example, is one of the best voice actors to come out of the 2010\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and even though he hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been acting long, his voice control and dramatic chops have landed him plenty of leading roles. He can do comedy under the right circumstances\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d know what these circumstances are if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen One Punch Man\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But he sounds horrible during the gag jokes.\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even worse for Erica Lindbeck, who had a tough job playing such a nuanced character as Kaori, whose happy-go-lucky persona hides a darker interior, and she does a great job of it, but the gag scenes just make her sound like a despicable asshole. Smaller characters face the same issue, albeit on a smaller scale, but the few veterans are able to navigate the minefield a lot more skillfully, like Wendee Lee(Who, in all fairness, never has to do a gag scene), Stephanie Sheh and Carrie Keranen. They have the experience to stretch their roles beyond the appropriate tones, which comes in handy here. The adaptive script is loose, but still accurate enough, and changes the vernacular so everyone sounds more like contemporary English, without ever sacrificing the intent of the text. They make a handful of charming and character-appropriate references, like occasional nods to Charlie Brown and The Phantom of the Opera, although they also use the phrase \u00e2\u0080\u0098as you know\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a few too many times. They probably should have changes some of the text, as a lot of it, when translated, sounds weird coming from 14 year olds.\n\nOkay, so, here we are again. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t too long ago that I was calling out modern anime fans for letting their emotions cloud their judgement, saying that they often give perfect scores to any anime that makes them cry. Seriously, you could give a critic a massage, a home cooked meal and the best sex of their life and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d still be working harder for a 10/10 than most anime do. Back in 2016, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d just uploaded my reviews of Clannad and Clannad Afterstory, and I asked social media to recommend an anime that had genuine feels\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 nothing manipulative, nothing manufactured, nothing too formulaic, just an anime that would touch me emotionally and make me cry with sincerity. The overwhelming answer was Your Lie in April, a show I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been avoiding due to all of the hype. I finally gave it a watch, and did it stand up as a heartfelt masterpiece, or did it offer the same old same old? Well, to be honest,it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little of both. My feelings on this show were mixed the first time around, and the second viewing hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t changed that.\n\nUnfortunately, Your Lie doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get off to a great start. The first thing we see is a foul ball hitting our man character in the head, lying on the floor and bleeding with what has to be a serious concussion, but not only does he heal immediately, but he shares the blame for the broken window the ball flew through. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just bad, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disturbingly bad. It sets an early precedent for him being a sad sack with no will of his own, which I guess is kind of accurate, but it also makes his closest friend look like a monster for taking advantage of it(Trust me, this feeling is only gonna get worse.) I try to move past this, but almost immediately, it becomes apparent that all three of Kousei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friends are some of my least favorite cliches in anime history. His two primary friends are Tsubaki and Watari, and they are\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Respectively\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 A childhood friend who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hopelessly in love with the main character, and a girl crazy guy who exists to make the main character feel desirable in comparison. I am so sick and tired of these two archetypes being stuck in orbit around at least half of the main characters in the medium.\n\nAnd Kaori\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worse, because she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a trope that I usually don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see in anime, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not complaining about that. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happy-go-lucky, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s childish, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an enlightened soul who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s able to see all of the simple joy in life, and she comes out of nowhere to dedicate her life to dragging the main male character out of the slumps. She is a Manic Pixie Dream Girl, which is to sexism what the Magical Negro trope is to racism. Granted, she deconstructs the trope a little bit, as she actually has a backstory and a reason to help Kousei, but she makes up for that small silver lining by taking the \u00e2\u0080\u009cLife begins at man\u00e2\u0080\u009d trope to a new extreme, as \u00e2\u0080\u009cLife begins AND ENDS at man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give her this, she IS the reason I kept watching the series, as I was entranced by her violin performance in episode 2, and she made me want to keep watching so I could hear more of her work, which sounded even better when she played with Kousei. On top of that, she plays an important\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Dare I say instrumental\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Role in Your Lie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deeper themes.\n\nYour Lie in April is a story about inspiration, and it attacks this concept from every possible angle. As annoying and cliched as his friends may be, Kousei is a good character who has a great arc that deals with this theme. He begins as a child, having fun doing something that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gifted at, until he stops doing it for fun and starts doing it as a future career, being forced to perfect it and take it seriously by his mother, who pushes him to the point of abuse. She controls his life, making everything he does revolve around the piano, even taking away his cat and abandoning it somewhere so it can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t scratch his hands. He loses the ability to hear the notes he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s playing, and quits altogether to avoid his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tyranny along with the intense pressure she put on him for not being good enough. On the surface, this is a very mature look at child abuse and the way it can have long term psychological effects on the developing mind, such as Kousei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance anxiety, and especially the fact that cats pose a trigger for him(And I mean the actual definition of trigger, not the bullshit internet definition), and the abuse in question is realistic, rather than cartoony or melodramatic.\n\nBelow the surface, this is a story for anyone who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ever lost their passion for something they once loved. The idea that expressive and interpretive music is frowned upon, and only literal performances are acceptable in competition, which is enforced by both the competition committee and Kousei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother, gives an understandable reason for his loss of inspiration. His music was becoming routine, and pointless. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think his inability to hear the notes he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s playing is realistic at all, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s symbolic for that loss of passion. When your work becomes routine, it becomes repetitive, and it finally becomes robotic. When your hobby becomes work, you fall out of love with it, which is why Kaori coming into his life was such a major turning point for him. She showed him that there was another way to play. She inspires him, breathing new life into his abilities, and helps him to separate his passion from the pain and sadness that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d come to associate it with, and it changes his life in so many ways\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 He starts playing again, he comes out of his shell, and he even begins teaching a younger pianist\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 That he winds up inspiring her in return.\n\nThey also make an argument that you play even better when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re playing for other people, and while I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never personally agreed with that, they make a compelling case. Your own music, your own performances, are not your only legacy. The music you inspire others with is just as important, as your work also lives on through their work. They make a great point when they say that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to play the piano when you compare yourself to Beethoven, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not nearly as hard when you remember that Beethoven was once just like you, a rookie trying his best to measure up to the greats who inspired HIM. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a shame they had to resort to a manic pixie dream girl in order to pull this off, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largely forgivable, especially considering certain reveals that happen in the final episode. So yeah, this is not a shallow series. There is meat to the story, and something meaningful that you can get out of watching it. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be happy to say that the series was also executed well, but sadly, this is where things start to break down.\n\nThe text of the series, for example, is severely lacking. The idea of inspiration and Kousei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character arc are well written and exactly as subtle as it needs to be, but the other subplots\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The romantic ones in particular\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Are annoyingly obvious, and frankly, kind of arbitrary. I mentioned Tsubaki as a \u00e2\u0080\u0098childhood friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099 earlier, and while this should instantly telegraph that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never get her guy\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They never fucking do\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 She does absolutely nothing else to justify her presence. Everything about her revolves around her love for Kousei and why he won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t respond to it. Every aspect of her life ties in somehow to her love for him, and since it amounts to nothing, she could have been written out in the first half of the series. I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go into too much detail about the other romantic subplot, or how it offers Watari his only relevance to the plot(although he does have a few moments relating to the theme), but they commit one other huge mistake\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They use constant, and I mean constant, voice over narration from the characters as they explain their feelings to the audience. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lame, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tedious, and it seems to be trying it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best to keep YOU from thinking too hard about what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching, because it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want the pointless teenage melodrama to lose it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effect.\n\nAnother huge problem is the gag humor, which feels inappropriate and out of place. It makes the heavier themes of the show harder to swallow, and not just on an aesthetic level. For example: We see Kousei sustain head injuries during two of these gags, that result in him lying on the floor and bleeding out. We also see Kaori hit him right in the crown of the head with an axe kick, driving her heel down into his skull. Now, if these instances didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cause any lasting damage, and the people doing it are supposed to be seen as likable, how am I supposed to feel when his mother beats him in the head with her cane? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen him shrug off shit like that before, so I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care. Am I supposed to feel different because of the tone of the scenes? This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the fucking Looney Toons. Hell, even the Looney Toons had consistency. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be expected to believe that a portion of the material shown to me doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t count just because the writer was making a joke. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disgusting. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve complained about Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood making this mistake, but Your Lie is just as bad.\n\nAnd then you have the plot, which did not work for me at all. Like, I said the themes were strong in this series, but they suffered one major setback. Kousei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother physically abused him and forced him to play music the way she wanted him to, all because she thought it was in his best interest. His friends, however, do exactly the same thing. Sure, they might not take away his beloved pet, but they still harass him, assault him, chase him, break into his room and generally act like complete assholes in order to get their way. He warns that his performance might not be good, he falters due to a psychological breakdown, Kaori has Tsubaki and Watari start roundhouse kicking him, and HE apologizes. How are they any different than his mother? Because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supposed to be comedic? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not exaggerating when I say that most of the interactions he has with his friends make me cringe, with their only justifications being \u00e2\u0080\u0098comedy,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and the fact that they just happened to wind up being right. So the ends justify the means.\n\nAnd then you have Kaori\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entire plot, which\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Okay, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to try not to go into spoilers, but if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen the show, you know damn well what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m talking about. And this is the big one, the one that makes everybody praise the show out the wazoo, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try to be gentle. At the end of episode 4, Kaori faints on stage. At that moment, even though I was trying to enjoy the series despite it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flaws, I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help it. I knew where this was going. I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh fuck, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gonna (censored), isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t she?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I am dead serious about that. The beginning of the fifth episode featured her in the hospital, and folks, I predicted everything. I knew what was going to happen to her, i knew she was keeping it secret, I knew that it was going to be kept deliberately vague all the way to the end, I knew I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never hear her play again(outside of maybe a dream or fantasy sequence), I knew what her backstory and connection to Kousei was going to be.\n\nKnowing this stuff in advance took a huge damper off of the emotional impact of literally any point of the show. Granted, I did make one prediction that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t true. I predicted we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never meet her parents, which I wish had turned out true, because her parents are\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Brace yourself for this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re Nagisa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parents from Clannad. They are literally that. They own a pastry shop, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re wacky and over-the-top, they live in said shop, and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one other spoiler connection, but that, along with a painful firefly sequence, made your Lie feel TERRIBLE at foreshadowing. I found myself, in both moments, shouting at my TV screen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOkay, I get it, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gonna (censored), shut the fuck up about it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d So did the big bad tragedy work on me? No, of course it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. The only part I got choked up at was a late scene when a cat died at a vet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office, because it brought up painful memories for me. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get me wrong, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something here, and it does make the experience a rewarding one, but it just couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stick the landing.\n\nYour Lie in April is available as a Rightstuf Exclusive, and I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the price is offensively high. Even on sale as part of the site\u00e2\u0080\u0099s holiday deals, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll still costed 130 dollars for each HALF of the series, down from 160 dollars regular price. Used copies on ebay go for as low as 60 dollars for each HALF, and I can not recommend you pay that much for an overrated series. You can watch it for free on Netflix, but if you absolutely need a physical copy, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d actually go against my better judgement and recommend the Malaysian bootlegs on Ebay, which do come with a dub for a fraction of the official price. The manga is available from Kodansha comics, and volume 1 even comes with a sweet exclusive cover if you get it from Loot Crate. The live action movie is probably available stateside, but from what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard about it, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care enough to check.\n\nYour Lie in April isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a great anime, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also not a terrible one. So, overall, is it good or bad? Well, to be honest, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enjoy the vast majority of it. I found the gag humor annoying and in bad taste, I found the comedic violence way too similar to some of the tragic material, there are too many cliches, and I caught on to some of the more important plot points way too early to fall for them. Having said that, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say the experience was a bad one. The themes of Kousei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character arc resonated very strongly with me, as someone who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s currently falling out of love with a long time hobby, and while I found his friends to be wholly unlikeable, his piano rivals were much more interesting, and I actually want to see more of him interacting with them. The final tragedy would have been a lot stronger if it hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been so obvious, or if it at least had a proper explanation, and you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t possibly deny that the audio and visual production went beyond top notch. It had a lot of problems, but honestly, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an okay show. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t live up to the hype, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth checking out. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m being generous here, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give Your Lie in April a 6/10. "}, {"id": 3192, "score": 60, "body": "Yuzuru Otonashi has a problem. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just woken up on the ground outside of a strange school, to find out that his unconscious body has been guarded over by an even stranger girl wielding a gun that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bigger than she is, and the only thing he remembers is his name. But before he can ask what the hell he drank last night, she explains that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dead. And she says this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 while aiming her gun at another girl. She goes on to explain that this other girl, an apparent angel, is the mortal enemy of her and the group she leads\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The Underworld Battlefront. Or the \u00e2\u0080\u009cLike Hell I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m Dead Battlefront,\u00e2\u0080\u009d depending on what version you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching.\n\nBelieving this story to be bat-shit crazy, and who could blame him, the boy shrugs off her story, and decides to approach the other girl, who echoes the first girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claim that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no longer among the living. He asks for proof, so without hesitation, she stabs him through the heart, killing him. He wakes up in bed later on, his bloodstained shirt serving as a definitive reminder that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not in Kansas anymore.\n\nHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not in Oz, either\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Probably. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in some vaguely defined computer-based version of Purgatory where teenagers end up whenever they die unfulfilled. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t die in this world no matter what happens to you, you can magically build inanimate objects out of dirt, and if you take school too seriously, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll disappear. This is a lot of nonsense for our hero to take in, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all real, leaving him no choice but to take his circumstances at face value.\n\nIf the aesthetic of this series reminds you of famous Kyoto Animation titles such as Kanon, Air, and Clannad, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not too far off\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Angel Beats was designed by the same people who created the original visual novels for those other shows. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where the comparison ends, however, as the animation was done by a company named PA Works\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a company that has a very small, but very impressive, production history. True to form, Angel Beats is right at the top of my list of the most well produced anime I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not just talking about the visuals.\n\nIf there has ever been an anime that I rushed to buy the soundtrack to, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this one. I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t heard an anime soundtrack that was this beautiful since Bastard. The compositions are diverse, inspired, and in many cases, you can tell exactly what scene a tune is from just by listening to it with your eyes closed. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that good, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that memorable. The opening theme is probably one of the least skippable I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen, with a mind-blowing piano score set to our title character rocking out on that exact instrument. The ending theme is also great, as it has a very melancholic tone, and the way it ties into it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s video won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really be made clear until the end of the series. But the heart and soul of the music\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 As well as the heart and soul of this series in general\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Is the fictitious anime band Girls Dead monster, a pulse pounding rock band formed by a handful of the students. This band has it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s OWN separate soundtrack, and trust me, they deserve it.\n\nWhen talking about the animation, the comparison to Kyoto Animation must once again be brought up\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Angel Beats clearly had just as high a budget as the Kyo-Ani classics, with endlessly smooth and graceful movements from the characters and environment, but unlike most of those shows, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t waste it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s money on mundane slice of life activities\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Oh no, they do SO much more with it. This show goes so all out with it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s big, epic Sci-fi action moments, smoothly blending CG with traditional visuals, that it even puts the first season of Haruhi Suzumiya to shame. Even the background characters\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 AKA the NPCs\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Are well animated, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen a ton of shows that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother to go that far.\n\nAs for the characters? Well, I guess we should start with the title character. Angel\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Or, as she comes to be known, Kanade Tachibana\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Is a very problematic character, as some of the greatest flaws in the series revolve around her. She has a really unique motivation behind her actions, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give her that, but it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make her a well written character. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really delve too deep into my problems with her without going into some pretty heavy spoilers, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be saving my comments about her for my much more liberal post about this series next week. As for her co-star, Otonashi, well, I also have some mixed feelings about him\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not your typical Key lead, as he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make a habit of getting involved in other peoples\u00e2\u0080\u0099 problems, but he also doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really do anything else to make up for it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Aside from commenting on the crazy things all the other characters do, his only role in the story is to form a relationship with Angel so he can pass on what she knows about this world to the Battlefront, but that wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be an issue if she had ever just told them herself\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Which she totally cold have done at any time. Having said that, the development of their relationship is one of the better aspects of the show, so I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t complain too much.\n\nYurippe Nakamura(The girl with the gun), on the other hand, is a very compelling character. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s active, she has clear motives supported by one of the cast\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most hauntingly tragic backstories, and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s by far the only character who ever takes the initiative towards moving the story forward. She bears some similarities to Haruhi Suzumiya, both in her appearance and her attitude towards her followers, but she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a much more reasonable and intelligent character than Haruhi ever was. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strong and perceptive, and has quite possibly the best character arc in the whole show.\n\nAs for our secondary characters, Hinata is the first person who really befriends Yuzuru, and the dynamic between them is pretty enjoyable, despite the forced \u00e2\u0080\u009cBromance or Romance?\u00e2\u0080\u009d jokes. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s constantly insisting that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not gay, and in a flashback, he proves it by showing us how terrible a catcher he is. Yui is the fast-talking air-head, and while her hyperactive and sometimes idiotic ways are a constant source of annoyance for Hinata, they do show a genuine affection for each other. Naoi makes for a pretty decent villain when he first appears, but after having his cruel ways changed by the power of fwiendship, he basically just becomes a constant gay joke that never gets a punch line. Iwasama is the original lead singer of Girls Dead Monster, and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, despite only appearing in three episodes, you could write an entire paper on her. In a good way.\n\nThe rest of the cast barely deserves to be mentioned, if at all. Oda and Shiina make for some good visual gags from time to time, but TK is one of the laziest character ideas I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever heard of. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d really like someone to explain to me why he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so popular. Those three included, everybody in th supporting cast is pretty much an interchangeable gimmick with a human face. You could swap any of them out with a girl who likes to skateboard while dressed like a crab, and nothing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Absolutely nothing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Would change as a result.\n\nMonolingual as I am, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say too much about the Japanese dub\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Just that it sounded really, really good. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leagues better than the English dub, which was written by the infamous Stephen Foster, and yes, it stinks opf all his trademarked awfulness. If you can stomach hearing an awkward line like \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought you were just some gun-toting girl or something\u00e2\u0080\u009d and not switch languages, then you know less about how people talk than HE does. He takes a lot of unfortunate liberties with the dialogue, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably solely responsible for the mispronunciation of the word \u00e2\u0080\u0098suplex,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just an awkward time to be had in general. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be honest, though, while I definitely noticed how bad the writing was, it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really piss me off until he rewrote one of my favorite Yurippe quotes near the end.\n\nHaving said all that, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t condemn the dub completely\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. Like with most of Foster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work, the writing may be awful, but the acting overall is actually pretty decent. Likewise, there were a few really impressive performances. Luci Christian is at the top of the class as usual. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s made a career out of being one of the best emoters in the business, and even though she only gets a single episode of screen time as Iwasama, she still lets her veteran instincts bleed through with every word. Hilary Haag puts her signature hyperactive energy into her role as Yui, forcing me to wonder just how versatile her insidiously high pitched voice can be. Brittney Karbowski owns the role of Yuri, and as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve mentioned in previous reviews, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always a joy to listen to. David Matranga takes the subtle, humorous edge that he gave to his character in the lead role from Clannad and carries it over to Hinata, to stunning effect.\n\nBut it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not all sunshine and rainbows\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Blake Shepherd is the flat out terrible lead role, and for the life of me, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wrap my head around why they trusted him with it. Emily Neves, in the role of Kanade\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Um\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do a bad job, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just sort of mediocre. I mean, if you have three of the best voice actresses in the company in your cast, and give the \u00e2\u0080\u0098lead role\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to an actress who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s career highlight at that point was getting booted off of American Idol, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a very flattering comparison. I would have placed this role in the hands of someone more capable, like Jessica Boone or Taylor Hannah, but to be fair, Emily\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talent HAS grown by leaps and bounds since this role. And TK shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have had an English voice actor at all, since his entire schtick is that he says nonsensical one-liners in Engrish.\n\nPersonally, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend the sub, but if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a hardcore dub fan, then the acting in the dub should at least be satisfactory.\n\nThe meat of Angel Beats can be difficult to talk about, so I think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll open by saying it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an anime that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supposed to watch with your heart, and not with your head. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full of intense passion, strong emotions, and just enough gripping characters so that any viewer will find at least one to relate to and root for. The romantic melodrama and tear-jerking tragedy of this mysterious world is designed to grab you right by the heart and hold on for dear life, because if it should ever fail to keep that part of you engaged, you brain would kick in, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d notice right off the bat just how much of an unholy mess this story really is.\n\nOne of the first things Yuri tells Otonashi is that he should just go with it, and accept things as they are. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to think this advice goes double for the viewer\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Turn your brain off, because this story doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make a lick of sense. Now, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get me wrong here, a fictional story doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to make sense to our universe. It has to make sense according to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own universe. With nearly every single story element, we get an explanation of what it is, an explanation of how it works, and a direct contradiction within three episodes time.\n\nThere aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a lot of examples I can give of this without dropping some spoilers\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Once again, tune in next week for that rant\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But you can take, for example, the Battlefront\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attitude towards Angel. In an early episode, Yuri explains that they have to be careful, and keep all conversations about their plans under wraps, because they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know whether or not Angel can hear them. Well, in only a few episodes time, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re nonchalantly discussing their plans right on the other side of the classroom from her\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 She doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to notice, and for the most part, they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem worried that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll notice.\n\nAnd there are other examples\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The other students who weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t brought here from another life are called NPC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and while they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supposed to turn a blind eye to the Battlefront\u00e2\u0080\u0099s antics, they show up in droves to a GirlDeMo concert, and line up for a monster fish meat give-away. The former of the two examples was pointed out by one of the characters\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 As a matter of fact, a lot of the inconsistencies in this show are pointed out by the characters, as if the writers thought that making the script self-aware of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own flaws would somehow make up for those flaws.\n\nThe pacing of this anime is a serious issue. We get plot point after plot point after plot point thrown at us at break-neck speed, and with no build-up or development for any of them, they just fly by without making much of an impact. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little to no character development outside of the main cast, and as a result, more than three quarters of the cast go completely unexplored, existing only to spout off their assigned one-note-jokes and occasionally die for our amusement. I strongly feel as though both of these problems could have been solved if the show had a 24-26 episode run, like it was initially supposed to.\n\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re introduced to important details that quickly become forgotten or conflicted, plot points that are almost immediately made pointless, and the only explanations they ever stick to are the ones that sound like complete cop-outs. The incomprehensible nature of the world they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in ultimately culminates with an underground scene between Yuri and some mysterious figure in a room full of computers. This is by far the most insulting moment in the entire series, as several of the questions we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve asked about it are resolved with lazy answers ranging from \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was like this when I got here\u00e2\u0080\u009d to \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe power of love.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd all of this culminates in a conclusion that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emotionally powerful, as well as a relentless tear jerker, but upon closer inspection is nothing but a clusterfuck of plotholes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And no, i\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not just talking about the one plothole that everybody knows about. There are deeper, much more destructive plot holes that undermine the entire premise of the show, take the stakes completely out of the climactic final battle, and render the two strongest episodes completely pointless. And once you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve realized them, they will probably make you feel like the biggest fool on earth for loving it as much as you did. And even as someone who genuinely does enjoy the series, it just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be forgiven for writing that lazy.\n\nAngel Beats is available from Sentai Filmworks. The DVD set has been out for a while, and it includes one of the few OVA episodes, which is worth a few good laughs. The set set can be found for a modest sum on Ebay, and at the time of this writing, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s available for a bit cheaper as part of the Rightstuf.com December sale. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not available on Netflix anymore, but it IS still available on Crunchyroll. And as long as you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a member, and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to put up with six commercials per episode, Crunchyroll\u00e2\u0080\u0099s awesome. There are a handful of CD soundtracks that can also be purchased, and if nothing else,those are worth paying a pretty penny for. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apparently also a prequel light novel, but I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t read it, because it hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been officially translated yet.\n\nAngel Beats is a very poorly written story that relies entirely on it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spectacular visuals to distract you from the phenomenal lack of logic or consistency. It works masterfully on an emotional level, and despite the messiness that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supposed to overlook, it never feels hollow or meaningless\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but the logical side of Angel Beats is just so infuriatingly bad. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easier to appreciate for what it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t than for what it is, though.. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t follow any clich\u00c3\u00a9s throughout it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thirteen episode run, and none of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s characters fit into any of the tired stereotypes that plague the anime industry, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m willing to give it some credit for originality and effort. But the talent, overall, just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there.\n\nAnd do you want to know the absolute worst thing about it? The worst thing about this anime is that it is physically impossible to not enjoy it. It is relentlessly fun to watch, even for some stick-in-the-mud like me who kept his brain on full blast the entire time. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of things it does wrong\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Embarrassingly so, at some points\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But when it does something right, it knocks it right out of the park. The overly complicated plot comes with a surprisingly simple, albeit poorly constructed, story. The humor isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as spot-on as it probably should be, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inspired enough to keep you laughing just often enough. If nothing else, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll enjoy the hell out of the production values alone. I like to tell people this show is bad, or that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like it, but upon a rewatch(Like, for the sake of this review), I find I just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stay mad at it.  I give Angel Beats a 6/10"}, {"id": 3199, "score": 50, "body": "Going to a new school is never easy. Having to uproot your life and leave behind everything you know just to satisfy whatever reason your parents have that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re too young to understand is hardly fair for anyone, even though sometimes there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no choice in the matter. But what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even more unfair is when your family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s situation has nothing to do with it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 When your school closes down, and without a formal establishment left to provide you with an education, you have to either go to a neighboring school where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have the immediate disadvantage or to home school where you may never have opportunities to see your old friends again. this is the dilemma that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been posed to Hikari, Manaka, and their friends Chisaki and Kaname, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been forced to abandon their failing Nami Junior High and migrate to Mihama Middle School, and to make matters worse, they face discrimination the minute they set foot on campus\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Not because of the color of their skin or the way they speak, but because of WHERE they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come from\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Shioshishio, the village under the sea.\n\nNo, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just a bizarre local catchphrase\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Our four heroes are basically amphibious mermaids without tails. They can breathe with ease both in and out of the water, but need to be periodically drenched in salt water to keep themselves from dehydrating. At Hikari\u00e2\u0080\u0099s insistence, they all come to school wearing their old uniforms, a show of pride and resistance against their new day-to-day environment, which is an attitude their new classmates are all too willing to share, making comments about them smelling fishy and rejecting them as inhuman beings. On the surface(Pun not intended), this separation could be seen as a good thing, because if a surface dweller and a sea dweller ever cross the line with each other, the latter will be banished from Shioshishio and forced to live the rest of their lives as a human, which is a curse that has become all too common in the recent past. With vitriolic prejudice tormenting them on one side and the charms of one open-minded boy tempting them from the other, will these four fish out of water be able to balance their lives between home and school, or are both surf and turf headed for a new ice age hundreds of years in the making?\n\nWhile Studio Bones may be my favorite animation studio in terms of content output, PA Works is probably the best one I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in terms of quality and visual consistency. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve commented before on how Kyoto Animation, Studio Gainax and JC Staff can put out great looking shows that break down and become really cheap looking whenever the budget gets cut too thin, but PA Works is the few where I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen this happen. I can easily say the same thing for their 2013 offering, A Lull in the Sea, because the budget doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really drop until the second half, and even then, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pretty difficult drop for the inexperienced to notice. Visually, this series is just as teeming with life as any ocean, and this is especially clear in the ocean, where there are schools of fish swimming around through the environment, in both the background, foreground, and once in a while they even interact with the sea dwelling humans on screen.\n\nCharacter animation is also crisp and fresh, with little pieces of extra effort sprinkled in here and there to make their movements underwater feel more realistic, and to make their lack of practice moving above water feel a little more awkward. The character designs are nothing too extravagant, especially with most of the nameless adults looking more or less the same, and the only character who doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look like he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been pulled from the real world being the Sea God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remnant, Uroko-sama. The kids look fairly generic, but for the most part, their personalities are so distinct that you won;t have any trouble remembering what each one looks like. Their facial expressions are also very fluidly animated, highly expressive, and full of either youthful passion or adult stoicism, depending on the character. I did of course mention the animation budget drops in the second half, and thankfully, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a canonical reason for this.\n\nI won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spoil what happens halfway through the series, but what I will say is that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a reason for the underwater setting to lose all of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fish and most of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s people, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a reason for both sea and surface to a more intensely white color palette. The lack of underwater visual effects cannot be explained, however, but the lack of diverse expressions and extra movement can be traced back to a major shift in focus and tone, as there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a lot less going on in the second half than there is in the first half. More on that later, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pretty sure a huge chunk of the budget in the second half must have gone to the 3D visual effect of salt-flake snow falling in both the sea and surface settings. All that aside, the point that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most worth remembering is that the series may lose some of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flair, but it never gets so bad that it looks cheap, which is one thing you can always say for PA Works.\n\nThe soundtrack, for the most part, sticks to piano and string instruments, played in such a way that they almost sound like they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re echoing underwater. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s music that, for the most part, that reminds you of the sea, even if it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t attached to this series. There are some exceptions, like Ofunehiki no Uta, which draws upon a fictionalized Japanese tradition, and thus falls back on a much more traditionally eastern sounding orchestration, complete with backup singers and what might be the only wind instruments in the show. Another odd standout is Uroko Sama no Monogatari, a tune that plays around the character of Uroko-sama, and oddly enough, it almost sounds like the extended beginning to a country song. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really say that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a memorable soundtrack, and there really aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any standouts that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d get any enjoyment out of without having the show to put them in context, but there are quite a few of them that can move you to tears if you listen to them while remembering the scenes that they were used in, especially in the case of Ofunehiki no Uta.\n\nThe first opening, named after the anime itself, is a bit on the generic side, an upbeat pop song that you could find attached to pretty much any slice of life anime. The visuals, on the other hand, are nothing if not stunning. While the song fits the mold of slice of life, the video that accompanies it breaks that mold, offering a beautiful look at the two towns and their inhabitants, all while remaining consistent with the animation quality from that half of the series. On a related note, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s water animation in this opening that could hold it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own against Free!. The first ending theme, Aqua Terrarium, is also somewhat generic, albeit with it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visual accompaniment being lingering shots of one of Manaka motionless in the sea. So, yeah, standard ending animation. The second opening, Ebb and Flow, carries a much more somber tone than the first one, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s imagery of time having passed can possibly tug at your heart strings for an episode or two, at least until you realize what direction the rest of the series is taking. The second ending theme, Mitsuba no Musubi, is just as unremarkable as the first, albeit with an unexpected shift in art style.\n\nThe english dub was produced by Bang Zoom, and I just want to say off the bat that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been turning into a HUGE Max Mittelman fan lately. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still relatively new in the industry, but as I mentioned in my One Punch Man review, he deserves all of the lead roles he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already been getting. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s playing a character who starts off angsty and confrontational, and if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re being completely honest, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also kind of an asshole. He develops over time to become much more reasonable and understanding, and throughout the whole process, he plays off of Michelle Ruff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Manaka(Can I call her Monica from here on? Screw it, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m gonna anyway) beautifully. While Monica is the target of both Hikari\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aggression and later affection, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no hapless Yamato Nadeshiko type character. She responds to his behavior the way any actual girl her age would respond to a close friend acting like a bully, by chastising him for being aggressive and threatening to stop hanging out with him if he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cool it. They become much stronger characters by the halfway point, and the actors have more than enough chemistry to pull it off.\n\nUnfortunately, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t speak as glowingly about the rest of the main four, as Kaname and Chisaki aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite as interesting as their floundering friends. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not unlikeable characters\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 At least, not at first\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to describe them outside of their looks and their positions inside of the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s love polygon. Brianna Knickerbocker and Bryce Papenbrook perform admirably in these roles, but still feel quite underused. Xanthe Huynh and Erica Mendez have a much more rewarding turn as Miuna, a little girl from a damaged home, and Akari, the woman who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s found herself tied by fate to Miuna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s single father. Their efforts to overcome prejudice and unchecked emotional turmoil in order to come together as a family is one of the biggest driving forces of the first half of the series, a fact that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lost on either actress, who put out some of the most genuine, raw emotion out of the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entire cast. Chris Hackney also does a commendable job as Tsumugu, a land-living boy who finds himself drawn into Hikari\u00e2\u0080\u0099s group of friends. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the first actor to give a stoic character personality, but he still pulls it off pretty damn well. There aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very many standout performances over-all, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a solid dub that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more or less on equal footing with the original sub.\n\nAt first glance, A Lull in the Sea may appear to be another slice of life romantic comedy, with it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only distinction being it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neo-little-mermaid gimmick. Thankfully, the writers waste no time whatsoever establishing that there are real themes at play here, and that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re timeless themes to boot. At the beginning of the series, the people of the land and the people of the sea are not on good terms whatsoever. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen plenty of fictional allegories for racism in my day, and while most of them amount to angry strawmen claiming \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe round people shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be getting mixed up with them circle people\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the Disney version of Pocahontas sporting a song that blatantly states \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not like you and me, which means they must be evil,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lull takes a much more thorough approach. The differences between the sea people and the surface people has some serious depth to it, as it exists not only in real time, but stretching back throughout their long term geographically close relationship with one another.\n\nWhile it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true that the setting does feel a bit underdeveloped, and the idea of an undersea village living as neighbors to a realistic, modern land village does bring up a lot of questions that never get answered, these flaws in world-building are easily over-shadowed by just how uncanny the plot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resemblance to real life social issues can be. with the exception of the Sea God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s backstory, every single social injustice we see in this series can be drawn as a parallel to an issue that either occurs or used to occur in real life. The idea of middle and even high school students instantly rejecting and tormenting other students for the simple crime of being different has been happening since the dawn of time. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s practically a rule of being adolescent, regardless of how adult international relationships may or may not be influencing it. For some minorities to want to rebel against this discrimination by being confrontational and having a bad attitude while others try to be on their best behavior in order to fight stereotypes through pacifism, and even for these two sects to clash with each other, is also disturbingly relevant to race relations in any society that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s managed to diversify itself. This is in stark contrast to Japan, a racially homogenous nation where this series oddly takes place.\n\nHarking back to Hikari\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sister Akari(yes, those two names are put together in anime far, far too often), she originally had a job on the surface, until it was revealed that she was in love with her single father boss, and was harboring an intent to marry him. She was rejected outright from both sides, with her boss\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter not wanting the union to take place for certain spoiler reasons, but she was especially contested by her own people, including her father, because of a village rule stating that anyone who fell in love with a land lubber would never be allowed in the sea again. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s later revealed that the legend of the Sea God was behind this rule, but even if he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, this attitude still rings true today, as there are tons of parents out there who would rather die than see their offspring wind up in a relationship that might compromise their heritage. Hell, one of my favorite scenes occurs long after the children have already put their differences aside, and the adults from both sides are coerced into a negotiation over a necessary ritual, which goes great until both sides start demanding apologies over perceived injustices of the past, an argument that almost becomes violent before the who kerfuffle is blamed on the kids, suggesting that racial differences are harder to get over for the older generation than the younger one.\n\nIf I hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t made it obvious to you by now, the two biggest recurring themes in this show(at least the interesting ones) are prejudice and desegregation, themes that are told primarily from the point of view of four sea-dwelling middle schoolers trying to fit in at a surface-dwelling school, but when you take a step back from them, you can see the issue from the perspectives of the human kids, the hopeful teacher, the adults who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve lived through issues the kids can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fully understand, the young star-crossed lovers and more. All of these different perspectives, almost all of which are realistic and relevant to the viewer in their own way, give the series a sense of depth and complexity that most slice of life shows can never even hope to reach. Characters grow and develop as their minds become more open and their hearts become more accepting, and yeah, even the bullies become likeable through the course of the story. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a sprinkling of developing crushes to add some spice to the main cast, but it takes a back seat to more important plotlines. All of this leads to a climax that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s equal parts inspiration and tragedy, and an ending that will have you crying your eyes out\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Halfway through the series.\n\nYeah, this is pretty much where my praise of A Lull in the Sea ends, and the ravaging must begin. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to try my best not to spoil the climax of episode 13, as I do believe everyone should be able to experience it blindly for themselves, but I will reveal some\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 stuff, from the second half, so here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your warning. If I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it was important to talk about, I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be spoiling it. For example, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the fact that episode 14 starts off with a five year time skip. One of our four main characters has aged naturally, but the other three are still 14, through some means I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel like explaining. Considering how the first half ended, this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the worst way to continue the series, and there is some potential for the story to develop under these circumstances, but here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the problem\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The racial tension, by this point, has been completely resolved. The people making the show must have realized they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d written themselves into a corner, and the only way to continue was to abandon all the depth of the first half and instead focus on the love-polygon, which quickly becomes a love-dodecahedron.\n\nGoing forward, a lot of dumb decisions are made to get the writers out of their corner, but the one that instantly had me doing the hardest head-desk of my life was when, in a flash-back, we hear nine year old Miuna getting jealous over Hikari, a character she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never shown any special affection for throughout the first half. I did the math on the time skip, and guessed on the spot that this show was about to rely on one of the creepiest, unrealistic, sexist ideas that anime has ever come up with. To get a vague yet still accurate picture of what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m talking about, picture Love Hina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Keitaro Urashima, the boy who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pursuing a girl he knew from his childhood. Now, instead of a male character falling back on a memory because he can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get a girlfriend through any other means, picture a female character who COULD get a boyfriend, but refuses to because she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather end up an old maid than betray some dude she had a crush on as a child. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bad, and a lot of anime do it, but most anime don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go the extra mile of using a time skip to make the girl and her old friend the same age so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be okay. Only it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not, because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still creepy.\n\nOh, and it gets worse\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Her friend, the mischievous moppet Sayu, falls in love with another 14 year old because\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Get this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 He patted her on the head and called her a good girl. Ooh, scandalous, right? That has to be the most laughable catalyst for an \u00e2\u0080\u009cI WILL NEVER LOVE ANOTHER\u00e2\u0080\u009d that I have ever heard. I wish I could go into deeper spoilers, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already said too much, so let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s summarize this: The second half of the anime exists for two reasons. First of all, it exists to explore and conclude the love dodecahedron, which it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, and it also exists to ret-con the conclusion of episode 13 so that the series can end on a happier note, which\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Unfortunately\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 is executed in a very fanficcy way that tears a massive plot hole in the lore of the story. Basically, the entire second half of the anime didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need or deserve to exist, especially since the first half ended on the perfect note, a beautiful tragedy that warranted no farther than one epilogue episode to wrap things up. You came close, Lull\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 You came close.\n\nA Lull in the Sea is available stateside from NIS America, which of course means it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ridonkulously expensive. Luckily, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also available in both dub and sub form on Crunchyroll for subscribers. The original manga by Project \u00e2\u0080\u0093 118 is not available stateside, nor is the follow-up four-panel manga from the same writer. Personally, I recommend the Crunchyroll subscription, if you can afford it. I had to cancel mine after paying 1000 dollars on a car bill, but then again, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m an old ass adult. Subscribe with your parents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 money, kids!\n\nA Lull in the Sea is kind of like The Big O\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I fell in love with the first half, and then found my jaw dropping farther and farther to the floor as what was previously awesome and enjoyable became huge disappointments once they got over the hump. Also like Big O, I wish to God that MAL would separate the two halves into their own entries, so that I could judge them separately instead of lumping them together. Why does the second half of this show exist? What was the point of it? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to sit here and stream the manga, so I have no idea how well this show holds up against it, but if they did the second half just for accuracy, then maybe they should have broke away from the source material and found a way to end it with episode 14. None of these love interests needed to be resolved, which\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Oh, by the way, they weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Nor did the perfect ending, which happened at the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s halfway point, need to be repeated under dumber circumstances to force a happy ending. This show could have been good. It should have been good. Yeah, a bad first half can be saved by a good second half, but a bad second half can destroy a good first half. This is a damn shame. I give A Lull in the Sea a 5/10."}, {"id": 3202, "score": 50, "body": "And now, Bum Reviews, with your host Grover C. Bum\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Tonight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s episode, Knights of Sidonia.\n\nSpoilers included.\n\nOH MY GOD THIS IS THE GREATEST ANIME I\u00e2\u0080\u0099VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an anime on Netflix, called Nights of Sit On Ya, and I clicked on it because I thought it was anime German porn, but what I got instead was so much more awesome! There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this guy\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 named Nagitotty\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s running around a futuristic looking society all confused and stuff. You can tell it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s futuristic because everything\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bland looking and white. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s running and running and doing parkour and base jumping, and screaming about how he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to get recycled!\n\nHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right, you know. In Japan, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supposed to separate the burnable trash.\n\nHe gets caught and arrested, because he comes from underground and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know anything about their society\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Even though this story takes place on a space ship, and how the flying fluff can there be uncharted areas on a spaceship\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But he escapes confinement by hiding on the ceiling!\n\nI told them it would be a bad idea to install monkey bars.\n\nBut then they let him go because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re being attacked by a discount space titan, and he apparently has had a lot of pilot training in the underground slums that have been set apart from society. On a space ship. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s had flight training on a space ship, but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s from the underground, so nobody knew he was training. Did I really see this anime, or was that leftover chinese older than I thought? Yah, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gotta be it. The nurse is a giant talking bear. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m definitely hallucinating.\n\nSo Nagitotty succeeds in his Attack on Space Titan, and as a reward, they start telling him things about their society. Like the fact that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all plant people, who use photosynthesis to eat straight radiation from any nearby star that they come across! Or maybe just the sun, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recall their location being specified.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Wanna Soak up the suuuuunnnnnn\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Wanna tell everyoooonnnneeee to weed my balls\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\nAnd then a girl on the ship tells him she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s genderless, despite the fact that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clearly designed to be a feminine character. She says that she has no penis or vagina, and won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get one until she falls in love with somebody of the opposite gender.\n\nAnd Nagitotty is like \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have genitals, how do you pee?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd SpaceTranny is like \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been holding it since birth. If I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t join some bland guy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s harem soon my bladder is going to explode.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd Nagitotty is like \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo I call you a \u00e2\u0080\u0098he\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or a \u00e2\u0080\u0098she?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAnd SpaceTranny is like \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust call me one of your many love interests.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo he gets taken to a classroom where a teacher tells him\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And a bunch of other people who are clearly his age\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 About how their society came about.\n\nI was in a class like that once! I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe they waited until college to teach me that Columbus discovered America.\n\nThen Nagitotty meets four fighter pilots who are touted as being the best and most talented warriors on the ship. And I bet he feels safe, knowing his safety is in the hands of four soldiers who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve fought together and experienced hell, side by side, and that their continued service will in no way end tragically.\n\nThen one of those pilots little sisters is like \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really cute!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd Nagitotty is like \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no idea what your advances mean.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd then SpaceTranny is like \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m turning into a woman because of you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd Nagitotty is like \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no idea what your advances mean.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd then one of his fellow pilots is like \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m the hottest one!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd Nagitotty is like \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s go see the Gravity Festival together!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nYes, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a gravity festival, because the Japanese will celebrate literally everything at some point or another. But then all of a sudden, another discount space titan attacks the ship. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s okay, because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got four elite soldiers on board\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Holy shed, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all dead!\n\nSo the ship jumps to ludicrous speed to get the fluff away from the rampaging space titan, which turns out to be a great idea, because the titan catches up with them anyway, and the turbulence caused way more death and destruction on it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own than the monster could have caused. I mean, wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want the poor thing to strain itself.\n\nSo instead of running away like pansies again, they send in a bunch more pilots, who are all paralyzed at once, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s okay, because Nagitotty flies in and gets revenge for them by being all awesome and victorious and Mary-suey and stuff! He exposes and attacks it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core to kill it, and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Wait, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m confused. Are they ripping off Attack on titan or Strike Witches now?\n\nHe goes to search for the hottest piece of ass in his harem, who floated away like a Modest Mouse song, and finds her lost in space, drifting in the frozen nothingness\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Oh, my bad, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that cold. Science lied to me. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re together for a few days before she takes off her clothes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Still a better love story than Twilight\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And absorbs some kind of sunlight, although I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember if they were near a star or not\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And there is no possible way that small ship they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re stranded on can hold sixty days of oxygen, or filter the radiation out of the light she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eating\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\nScience! Why u no tell me more truth?\n\nAnd they drink each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s piss until they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re rescued. Personally, I would have eaten her by then. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d cannibalize her, oh no, that would be terrible\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but we ARE all alone out in space, and she DOES keep getting naked. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bound to be some sexual tension.\n\nUpon returning home, Nagitotty meets his harem. The dead guy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little sister is like \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m done grieving, I want your bone now!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd Nagitotty is like \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no idea what your advances mean.\n\nAnd then SpaceTranny is like \u00e2\u0080\u009cSurprise, my intentionally feminine voice hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t gotten any deeper\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd Nagitotty is like \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no idea what your advances mean.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd then Plant Nudist is like \u00e2\u0080\u009cOops! We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in an enclosed space by accident!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd then Nagitotty is like \u00e2\u0080\u009cKay babe, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s look at the ocean together.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nYeah, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an ocean on this ship that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inside of a giant rock. I was inside of a giant rock once! It didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t end as well as 127 hours did.\n\nAnd then another space titan shows up, and the hot one dies, only she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t die, she just becomes one of the titans! Oops, I meant space titans\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Wait no I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t! Either way, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a gauner now.\n\nAnd then we find out that Nagitotty is an immortal clone of his grandfather, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a really important historical figure, and because of that, he was destined to become the most powerful soldier on the ship. Because being a personality-deprived harem lead with an evil rival who has long white hair wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t generic enough. He also has to be an unwitting chosen one who was born into destiny, like Ichigo, Naruto Uzumaki, Yusuke Yurimeshi, and so on and so forth.\n\nIt got really hard to follow after that, and I fast forwarded through the last three episodes. I will say, though, for a gritty sci-fi action drama that takes itself super-serious and has a high body count and way too complicated of a plot, Nights of Sit On Ya was surprisingly adorable.\n\nThis is Grover C. Bum saying\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 CHANGE? Ya got CHANGE? C\u00e2\u0080\u0099mon, give me some dollars\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Or at least give me some cents, because this series sure as hell didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make any. Help a guy out here!

The Movie is an Netflix Original animated by Polygon Studio which is adapted from the hit manga of the same name , written by Tsutomu Nihei.\nThe movie is about a dystopian , post-apocalyptic , Sci-Fi world and even though I haven't read the manga , I went into the movie pretty hyped up having heard great things about the manga. Did I like the move ? In a way , yes. But was it any good or worth your time ? Let's find out shall we ?\n\n-----------\nStory - 6\n-----------\n\nOkay , the start of the movie was.., Epic! \nThe world looked and felt atmospheric , dark and it was great. within the first few minutes , we get to see people's struggles , desperation to survive. I got immediately interested in world , which seemed to be the main selling point of the show. But as the series movie progressed , I felt more and more disappointed as it failed to explain any of the concepts of the world properly. There was this talk of a netsphere , net terminal gene and all this gibberish which immediately caught my interest but didn't put much effort into explaining any of them. And when it reached the ending , everything became even more convoluted and left me wondering \"What the fuck just happened? \" , and not in a good way like Evangelion series.\n\n---------\nArt - 9\n---------\n\nTHANK YOU POLYGON !! \nMy previous experience with Polygon was a series called Knights of Sidonia , which was also a Netflix original written by the same author. And that particular series had one of the worst Artworks I've ever come to pass.\nBut this time it's different , The movie looked stunning from start to end. Everything from the color palette , lightning and special effects truly captured the feeling of a dark and desperate world. \nCharacter models looked and was animated great ! battles scenes truly looked epic and smooth with vibrant reds and blues.\nSo in the Art and Animation department , Polygon really hit it out of the park with this one.\n\n-------------\nSound - 7\n-------------\n\nMusic for the series was composed by Yugo Kanno and he did a great job with it.\nEverything blended in with the atmosphere quite nicely and specially Killy's Soundtrack sounded great. All the sound effects with the battle scenes were on point and sounded good. To cap it off I found no fault with the voice acting either.\nIn short this had a good soundtrack , it could have been better but it's lived up to my expectations. \n\n------------------\nCharacters - 5\n------------------\n\nCharacters of this movie suffered the same fate as the World of the movie did.\nThey immediately caught my attention , but then was left without exploration or depth. Worst part of it was even the main character Killy was treated the same way. Even after finishing watching the movie , I had no idea who Killy was. All the information that was given to us was that his name is Killy , He got a really cool gun and he might be the last hope for humanity. That's it. \nThe movie didn't really do enough to care about most of the side characters except for a few. It felt like they ran out of time to give the characters much depth.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nEnjoyment and Overall Experience - 5\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nI didn't hate the movie , I loved the atmosphere and visuals of it. \nI would be really happy if we get a squeal to this and explore the world and characters more , and get answers to all the questions that left unanswered.\nSo all in all , it was a movie that didn't give enough but left me wanting more. \nDo I recommend it ? If we will have good squeals to this movie that builds on this world and characters that was presented in this movie , Then yes. \nIf not , then no , It wasn't a good stand alone movie.\n\n---------------------------\n| Recommendations |\n---------------------------\n\n[Attack On Titan] A non Sci-Fi version of Blame! , a dystopian world , humanity under attack and forced to live under shadows."}, {"id": 3211, "score": 50, "body": "The year is 2019. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been 31 years since a mysterious explosion happened in Japan, which somehow triggered World War 3. In the current society, a version of the city has been restored, and dubbed Neo-Tokyo, not to be confused with Tokyo-3. But as it turns out, what was supposed to be a new haven for humanity has already become dilapidated and worn down, with the new government at odds with the people, sparking violently destructive protests that are in no way helped by the scourge of anarchistic youths waging war with each other one the backs of their motorcycles. See, this is why we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have nice things. Two of these gangs are called the Capsules, a handful of middleschoolers with the image of a pill emblazoned on their jackets, and the clowns, a gang of\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Other thugs\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Who wear weird masks and stuff. Existing somewhere between The Sharks vs. The Jets and The Bloods vs. The Crips, their rivalry is a notoriously violent one, and their fights have terrorized an already restless population.\n\nIn any case, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s during one of these particular skirmishes that the Capsule Corps, led by the main character-ish young man named Kaneda, stumble upon a strange little Benjamin Button boy who inflicts another member, Tetsuo, with some sort of abnormality. The local government snatches up Tetsuo and the little geezer, and they disappear them to a secret facility to perform experiments on them. In order to rescue Tetsuo, Kaneda must work his way into a rebel faction in order to infiltrate the facility\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But strange things are happening to Tetsuo, within whom a dangerous entity has begun to awaken, granting him power beyond his control\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Power that attracts the interest of Button and his friends, who antagonize him in order to bring about his full potential. When Kaneda finally does manage to reach Tetsuo, what kind of reunion will await the two of them? Can Tetsuo be saved from the destiny that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s begun to develop around him, or is it too late for anybody to be saved?\n\nAkira was animated by TMS, also known as Tokyo Movie Shinsa, one of the oldest known Japanese animation studios. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve produced not only anime over the five decades that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been in operation, but plenty of western animation from their subsidiary company Telecom. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen a bunch of Telecom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s titles, with a particular highlight being the fucking Ducktales(Ooo-Wooo-Ooo), but out of their anime work, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m honestly not that familiar with them. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve produced some iconic titles that have been around for impossibly long periods of time, like Lupin(the only installment of which that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen was The woman Named Fujiko Mine) and Detective Conan, which I only saw the first season. Beyond that, any title they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve released is either something I saw very little of, or something I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen in over a decade, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of hard to get an accurate grasp on them in regard to their oeuvre of work.\n\nWhatever they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re like, they clearly had a ton of money to burn when they were producing Akira, and boy does it show. The animation in this movie is insanely fluid, especially for a title that was released in the late eighties. The quality is consistent throughout, but it only takes a few minutes to see that this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t your average production. Just as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re dumped into the interior of a seedy, suspicious bar, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re shown that not even such an arguably unnecessary visual as channels being changed on a TV is still given the kind of lavish treatment that would suggest that they really spared no expense with this one. To be sure, the movie then quickly moves on to one of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest highlights, the motorcycle race war\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yes, a literal race war\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Between the Capsules and the Clowns, which may be one of the single most well-animated sequences in anime history. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s several solid minutes of gritty dudes racing through town on their various models of bikes as they try to kill one another,r to varying and somewhat vague levels of success. This sequence is so fast and fluid that even the residual trails of their taillights in the night sky is beautifully present.\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weird looking back and thinking that an anime from 1988 could look as good as this one does, but it was just as weird for the world back then, as Akira was considered groundbreaking with it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visuals. The kind of facial animations and fluid movements it featured were unimaginable at the time, even though they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re more or less commonplace today. Most anime of the time was stiff, with limited articulation and frozen faces with moving mouths, which made this particular piece all the more breathtaking. Now, having said that, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of understandable, but I just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but feel they might have gone a bit too far overboard with this achievement, as the characters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 facial expressions are so over-exaggerated that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of hard to take what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re saying seriously at time, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a nit-pick on my part.\n\nAkira\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visual prowess doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just limit itself to the fluidity of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s animation, either. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also pretty well directed, with the man in the director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chair being Katsuhiro Otomo, whom, if you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, was also the creator of the manga, so in terms of the presentation, nothing was lost in translation. His sense of direction isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t perfect, as some of his action scenes can stray into a feeling of sensory overload, but there are moments in the government facility and especially in Tetsuo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room that feel downright chilling with the way they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re framed. The backgrounds of Neo-tokyo are so extensively detailed that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost sad how much of it you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll miss if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not constantly pausing to check out the environment, with it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s variety of different buildings and gorgeous lighting effects. It almost feels like a real city, and one that you could actually imagine living in, thanks to the level of immersion it manages to hit. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d keep going on this topic alone, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m struggling to find the right words to do it justice, and you kind of have to see it for yourself in order to appreciate it.\n\nAlthough, to be perfectly honest, my favorite thing about Akira is the music, which is uniformly unconventional in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orchestrations, and carries a level of depth to it that kind of evades the story itself, as composer Shoji Yamashiro, which is actually the pseudonym of Tsutomu Ohashi, and while further work of his is hard to find, Akira is his most renowned project, and with good reason. The music for Akira is stunningly powerful, full of hard percussions and haunting vocal effects, some of which tell us more about a character and their arc than the story itself does. For example, the most popular track in the movie is probably Tetsuo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s theme, which uses bells and flutes to signify the titular character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s younger-brother relationship to Kaneda, showing frustration in the beginning while slowly becoming more unhinged and unsettling as it builds up to one of the most famous vocal spike notes in anime, the infamous DAAAAAA DAAAAAAA DAAADAAA that heralds the arrival of his powers later in the film.\n\nThe rest of the ost is just as creative, however. Kaneda\u00e2\u0080\u0099s theme isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as long or involved as Tetsuo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s theme, but the instrumentation is still like nothing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard before from an anime, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decked out with lightning sound effects and shifting percussive beats that sound like they were taken from a traditional Japanese festival, complete with chants of Rasse-Ra, a chant used to welcome the summer. Other noteworthy tracks include Battle Against Clown, the battle theme for the opening gang war that somehow managed to take the sound of a guy breathing too hard and make it sound epic; Winds Over Neo-Tokyo, a tune that starts out slow and dreamy only to sound more ominous and carnival-y as it goes on; And Dolls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Polyphony, a damn creepy track that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s used appropriately in the film, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of a female voice uttering the nonsense word \u00e2\u0080\u009cPerom\u00e2\u0080\u009d over and over again sounds like it was taken right out of a slasher movie, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s before the deeper male chanting starts to drown it out. All in all, I highly recommend picking up this soundtrack, whether you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a fan of the actual movie or not.\n\nTo my knowledge, there are two English dubs for this movie\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 An old one, which was really awkward sounding and badly acted, and a newer one that sounds a lot more natural and human. The drawback is that while the old one at least managed to fit the insane mouth movements from the characters, the newer one doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even try, which in turn makes the over-animation look even more obvious and silly. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really think either dub is that great, but i kind of prefer the older Streamline dub, just because it sounds more interesting, even as terrible as it was. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get me wrong, the Animaze dub had a cast of much more talented and well-respected actors, and they did act out the roles a lot better than their Streamline counterparts did, but like I said, the natural sound and grounded delivery doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really feel like the right fit for the movie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s style of facial animation, whereas the Streamline one just feels like a better fit for this world.\n\nNot to mention, as talented as the newer acting pool is, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not made up of the most compelling actors in the industry. The perfect example of this is Kaneda, the apparent star, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s played by Johnny Yong Bosch, a highly talented actor who can give stellar, engaging performances when given the right material, but he has way too wide of a comfort zone, and once he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in it, he falls right into typecasting hell. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a shame that he can be so boring at times, but here, he just sounds like a less interesting version of Ichigo. On a similar note, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Wendee Lee in the role of Kei, whose performance output is almost fifty/fifty in terms of quality, with just as many awesome roles as terrible ones, and since Kei isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that meaty of a character, she falls somewhere in the middle here. Michelle ruff, a personal favorite of mine, is wasted in the role of Kaori. The exception to this trend is Tetsuo, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s played powerfully by Joshua Seth, a Digimon veteran who plays up his character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s youth and frustration, wearing his torment and rise to power on his sleeve. Either way, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d still recommend sticking to the sub.\n\nAll right, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to try to keep this brief, because I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really have all that much to say about Akira. To give this review a little background, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never read the manga this movie was based on. Honestly, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t read that much manga in general. My reading is reserved for books, mostly by Stephen King, while I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m passing time on my lunch break at work. Yeah, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gotten into a few series, but I can probably count on one hand the amount of titles I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve read to completion, or at least to the point of being caught up. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather absorb a story visually, where it takes less time and money to do so. Having said that, it means that I was essentially going into Akira blind, and taking it completely at face value, with no source material or outside information to explain it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story, universe or world view to me. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m reviewing this movie in a vacuum, as any title SHOULD be reviewed, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to do any research to augment or explain the material. A good adaptation should do that for you. So how does Akira hold up under these conditions?\n\nWell, frankly, this movie doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make any fucking sense. From beginning to end, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do any more than the bare minimum in explaining anything. To start right at the beginning, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re told that Japan accidentally bombs itself(I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell you how, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a spoiler), and that this event was the spark that caused World War 3, and that the story takes place several decades after. Okay, so, how did World War 3 start? And yeah, I hear you guys saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith that explosion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not what I mean. How did Japan accidentally bombing itself lead to the third World War? That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a small detail. You know what a World War is, right? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a war where a group of allied nations fight against the rest of the world. Did Japan blame the explosion on another country? Who were it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allies? Who were it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enemies? Did it win? Did it lose? How long did the war last? How did it end? Did it even end? What was the death toll? You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just throw World War 3 into your narrative because it sounds cool, damn it, you have to explain that shit!\n\nOkay, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another one: What are people protesting about? What is the government doing that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got the people so pissed off? What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the conflict there? Or here, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give you an easier one: Who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the guy we see leading the Benjamin Button kid through the crowd? Did he help him escape the facility? How? Or instead, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you what\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 How did Tetsuo get his powers? We see him crashing his bike right in front of Button\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, only to have it blow up between them, hurting neither of them\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 i mean, sure, Button was probably able to protect himself with a force field, but the explosion happened right in front of Tetsuo, who wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even scratched. Was it contact with Button that triggered his change? Is that a normal side effect of interacting with Button? Can he just do that, or was Tetsuo a special case who just happened to have dormant apocalypse inside him? Was it the experiments at the facility that changed him? Is there some piece of equipment they have that gives people apocalypse tumors? Would all of this crap have been avoided if Tetsuo were released with his friends? Or died when his bike blew up?\n\nI could throw it a bone if it had a cast of memorable characters, but guess what? I have no idea who any of these bastards are! I want to start by bringing up Kaori, because while she may not be one of the main characters, her role in the film is memorable for all the wrong reasons. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tetsuo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Sister? girlfriend? Stalker? I have no idea. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s barely in the movie, gets maybe five minutes of screen time, and her only big scenes are where she gets her face punched in and her top ripped off by a Clown member, and when she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gruesomely axed off towards the end of the movie. Her only contributions to the film are suffering, dying, and adding two seconds of nudity to the film\u00e2\u0080\u0099s content rating, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all so undeserved that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s honestly kind of uncomfortable to watch. She had no reason to be in this movie. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the only female character, but Kei is so underwritten that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard hardcore fans of the movie just refer to her in passing as \u00e2\u0080\u0098the female.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a terrorist, but why? What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s her connection to the government? What are her motivations?\n\nAnd it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a sad state of affairs that I have to say this, but speaking of Kei, who the fuck is Kaneda? Why am I supposed to be rooting for this person? What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supposed to be so interesting about him? I think he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the leader of the Capsules, right? And he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Main character material, or something? What does he want with Kei? Does he just happen to spot \u00e2\u0080\u009cooh, female,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and decide right on the spot that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to get her out of trouble and pork her? Like, half the movie he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just trying to get laid, and when he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not trying to guilt her into it, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going up against armed adults in her honor. This is coming from an asexual person, mind you, but is a random girl who doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem interested in you really worth taking a bullet for? I get the whole devotion thing, but when your life is on the line, dude, there are other fish in the sea. You shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ally yourself with literal violent terrorists over someone until you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve at least established a relationship with them.\n\nI mean, okay, I tried to assume that he was just sniffing her ass because he thought getting involved with terrorists could help him to get closer to Tetsuo, but he would have been enacting this plan way too early for there to be a believable amount of desperation, and besides, he hounds her about turning herself in, going straight and dating him afterwards. That sounds a little counterproductive, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you think? And moving onto his relationship to Tetsuo, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what kind of connection they shared until that random exposition dump at the end. Apparently they were orphans together. Up until then, I had no idea if they were friends, brothers\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Even lovers could have been possible\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 or if Kaneda was just super dedicated to his gang members. The most fleshed out character is Tetsuo, but the only thing we get from him is his frustration over his connection to Kaneda. The changes that happen to him over the course of the film are it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only, yes, only, source of character development. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry, but you need more than faces and names to have characters.\n\nThe only real concession that I can make for Akira is that it has a really well pronounced cool factor. Seeing gang wars waged on the backs of motorcycles against a vaguely post apocalyptic setting is really cool to see, and the movie would probably be better if that were all there were to it, but it gets so involved with it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s muddled, convoluted plot that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impossible to know what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on without reading the source material or making a ton of assumptions. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like this huge, thousand piece puzzle where none of the pieces fit. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even bring up the other two Benjamin Button kids, as their plans involving Tetsuo are so confusing and inconsistent that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m hesitant to even call them spoilers. But like I said, regardless of what it was they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re actually trying to accomplish, their efforts still play into the movie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cool factor, as they manage to bring us some truly trippy and surreal visuals when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using their powers to attack him in his room. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not much, but I guess if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just watching Akira for spectacle and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gritty adult tone, I can understand the appeal.\n\nbucket\n\nAkira is available stateside in a number of different home video releases, most recently from Funimation is a very cheap DVD/bluray combo pack. Other releases are available, such as the limited edition steel case that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m currently borrowing from a friend. The original manga has also been available in numerous printings, with the most recent being from Kodansha comics back in 2009. Each volume is still relatively cheap, or you could splurge and spend a little more money on the box set. At the very least, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend grabbing a copy of the soundtrack Cd, which is available from Milan records, and is fairly inexpensive online.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry, guys. i know this is one of the most popular anime movies in the medium, but I just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get into it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a terrible movie by any means\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The pacing is really good, and it never gets boring. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m the kind of guy who literally can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stay awake through a single showing of Empire of Corpses, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never fallen asleep during Akira, which at least speaks to it having some kind of entertainment value. I understand that adapting a phonebook thick manga collection into a two hour movie isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t an easy feat, but at the same time, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to have to look up footnotes and plot synopsis just to figure out what the bloody hell I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m watching. The version of the movie I watched had a sort of pop up feature that was designed to give you extra information at random points, but after like twenty minutes, all it had been showing me was a map and some Japanese text translations, and I was relying on THAT to try and be fair. I like movies that challenge me to figure them out, but not like this. For the animation and music alone, it deserves it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s place in anime history, but I guess I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just not a fan. I give Akira a 5/10."}, {"id": 3212, "score": 50, "body": "The future of the video game industry is here, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone far beyond the motion capture and voice commands that we raved about in the past. MMORPGs\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Or Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Games\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Have evolved beyond what was previously thought possible, thanks to an innovation called The Full Dive\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 A Virtual Reality system that syncs directly with your brain to transfer your very consciousness into an expansive, lifelike gaming universe where people from all over the world can interact and compete for hours on end while they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re bodies remain nice and safe in their beds. How can a gaming experience such as this possibly go wrong?\n\nOne of these new games, Sword Art Online, has taken the market by storm, becoming a fast fan favorite due to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s simple mechanics and universal accessibility. But then one day, a curious flaw appears in the system\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The log out button mysteriously disappears, leaving over ten thousand players stranded. And instead of an update or a patch to fix this issue, game creator Kayaba Akihiko gives them the most horrible news they could have possibly imagined\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 There is no way out. This world is now their world, and thanks to a booby trap hidden in their headsets, to die in the game\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Or to have your headset removed by an outside party\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Will mean their immediate real life death. The only way to leave is to clear all 100 floors of the game, a task that winds up in the hands of the best and strongest players in the game\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Including Kirito, a former beta tester. Can the thousands of forsaken souls trapped in their former escapist paradise ever see the real world again, or is all hope lost?\n\nWhether you love or hate this series\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And there are a lot of people claiming both extremes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one thing everyone seems to agree on; The animation in SAO is phenomenal. Studio AI, which was founded by a former Sunshine producer, has a very impressive resume behind them, having worked on several popular and visually spectacular titles like Fairy Tail, Black Butler, and Magi(none of which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m personally fond of). Their flair for expensive, all out, balls-to-the-wall action and movement is on full display here, with special attention being given to the expansive backgrounds, smoothly integrated CGI and the infinitely expressive countenances of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s many cast members. Unfortunately, the negative aspects of A1\u00e2\u0080\u0099s animation technique has also been carried over, as the cost cutting and corner cutting are everywhere, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never subtle about it.\n\nFor all the graceful animation we get with our main cast, you get crowds of people in the background just frozen like they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re part of the background rather than people living in it. For all the fast-paced, intense battle scenes, there are just as many where the aesthetic become cheaper and looser in order to compensate for the constant movement\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve mentioned in previous reviews, that kind of technique can make a show look really awkward when paused. Because of this, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I can get behind all of the other reviewers who call this one of the best looking shows they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen, but I understand why it looks the way it does, and I do generally think it does it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job fine. After all, there aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a lot of studios who have Kyoto Animation-level budgets behind them, so the lack of consistency can be largely forgiven\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I just wish it\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been managed a bit better.\n\nThe musical score, on the other hand, is nothing short of breathtaking. Yuki Kajiura is one of the most respected composers in the industry for a damn good reason, and while she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not quite as prolific as Yoko Kanno, the difference in style more than makes up for it. Almost all of the more memorable and emotionally stimulating moments in the series might have fallen flat if not for the expertly crafted and highly versatile tunes that she made to accompany them. Whether the tone of the series needs to be tense, frightening, somber, uplifting or full on heart-rending, Kajiura\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nearly celtic-sounding score always has the right tunes at the right time. For the best example of this, the low-pitched track \u00e2\u0080\u0098despaired\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is the saddest part of the already tragic episode 3. Her music has a very manipulative quality to it, and yes, I mean that in a good way.\n\nI wish I could go on to say that this series is a master of sound, but while the music excellent, the English dub is a bit\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, mediocre. It was done by Bang Zoom, who were surprisingly able to pick up a few Funimation actors for the job. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never really been a huge fan of Bryce Papenbrook\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Although he was decent in Blood Ladd\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And as Kirito, he sounds distractingly like Vic Mignogna going through puberty. Cherami Leigh as Asuna didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t impress me very much either. When I saw her name attached to the character, I thought\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Why? Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get me wrong, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great actor, but she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a lot of experience playing tough or intimidating women. Her voice is too high pitched and airy for it, and the part should have gone to someone with a deeper voice like Michelle Ruff. I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say either one of them did a bad acting job, they did fine, I just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find the casting believable in either case.\n\nThe rest of the cast, for the most part, is full of Bang Zoom regulars, with only a few sour notes in what is otherwise an okay dub overall. Cassandra Lee was very impressive as Leafa, especially when you consider the kind of character she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been saddled with. Christine Marie Cabanos better than usual as Silica, but she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still way below her Toradora performance. Marianne Miller, as Recon, is somebody I want to never, ever hear in a dub again. The only real standout performance is from Todd Haberkorn, who takes full advantage of his role as the narcissistic sociopath Sugo Noboyuki to be as sleazy and unlikeable as he possibly can, and boy is it glorious. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fine, listenable dub, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d do a lot better to just watch it in Japanese with subtitles.\n\nThen again, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really blame the actors for being mediocre when the characters they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re playing are so terribly, terribly written. Starting with Kirito, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very little depth to his character. He has trouble working with other people, he feels some serious guilt in his life, and these issues do give him some potential for development\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it. Beyond that, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a self insert male empowerment fantasy, which becomes even more blatant when you start to notice just how much of his story was inspired by Guts from Berserk. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an overpowered loner who travels the world being a better fighter than everyone else, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even nicknamed The Black Swordsman. And if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not enough, the circumstances surrounding his membership in Asuna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s guild are very reminiscent of Guts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 joining and leaving of The Band of the Hawk.\n\nBut then again, Guts never took it a step too far by becoming a harem lead\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Okay, maybe at ONE party. There number of female characters in this series who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t develop feelings for him could easily be counted on one hand, with a finger or two to spare. Out of the ones who do, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s generally the one helping them through their problems while they get strung along helplessly, regardless of their levels(Except for Suguha, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to that). This even includes Asuna, who follows him through a murder mystery story arc while HE solves every clue, and even though she holds the final piece of the puzzle the whole damn time, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the one who solves it after she mentions a key SAO marriage detail out loud.\n\nAnd Asuna? That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another issue entirely. Up until my recent rewatch of SAO, I thought she was the best thing about the series\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take me long to realize that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even less to her character than there is to Kirito\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a strong fighter, but she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a very strong character. In fact, if you took the romance out of her relationship with Kirito, IE their marriage and what-not, she could have easily been replaced with a fighting dog, especially when their meet-cute happened because he earned her trust with food. That, and let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s be honest here, the whole \u00e2\u0080\u0098damsel in distress\u00e2\u0080\u0099 thing from the second half of the series did her very few favors.\n\nAnd then you have Kirito\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other love interests, and dear god, are there a lot of them. Two characters are introduced in the early episodes who enlist him for help, fall madly in love with him, and are then dropped for most of the remaining series, only to be brought back at the end to reveal that they still haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t given up on him. Because yeah, God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gift to the fairer sex being taken off the market will not stop them from ignoring every other guy in the world on his behalf. Two characters from the second arc start pressing their boobs against his arms because he defended them from an ambush, and then\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s his sister. Yes, Suguha, his little sister, is in love with him. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll grant you that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re actually cousins, but for reasons that I stated in my Oreimo review, that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make it any better. This is popularly labelled the worst part of the series, and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yeah, but it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to be. I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have minded her falling in love with Kirito in the game, due to not knowing who he is, but the fact that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already fallen for him in real life just kills it.\n\nAnd then you have the villains. Each half of the series contains one true villain, set aside as the final boss of their respective worlds, and a smaller villain who causes some events to occur, goes nowhere afterwards, and then is completely forgotten about in the story. There are a lot of potential for these two MAIN villains, but the way they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re perceived by both the fans and the story is kind of baffling. People tend to hate the second villain, Sugu, because he imprisoned one woman and tried to take over the IRL world. What they seem to forget is that the first villain is directly responsible for the deaths of thousands of probably innocent people. And that wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s problem if it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for the fact that SAO actually seems to share this bizarre thought. I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spoil anything, but if you want to get a good idea of how bad this disconnect can get, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like you to picture watching Hitler receive a metal of honor for stopping a rapist. Yeah, that guy was a rapist, and old Dolphy did a great thing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still Hitler. Something like that actually happens.\n\nSo if this series has an inconsistent dub, poorly written characters, and some unsettlingly deep levels of sexism, why is it so popular? Why is it such a huge hit, as well as a major financial success? I said earlier that the strongest element of SAO is it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s musical score, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most successful element is the execution of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story. SAO bets all of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chips on suspense, tempting the audience to keep coming back because they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keep the ongoing conflicts and how they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be resolved out of their heads. And it works. The news of entrapment and possible death in the SAO universe hits the heart hard, bringing some serious stakes to the table, and they play with this concept in all the right ways and at all the right moments\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Right up until it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resolution, in one of the most perfectly timed and logically stupid plot twists I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen. It made more sense in Berserk.\n\nFor the most part, the other looming conflicts are just as powerful. Even if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like the characters, you want to know whether or not Kirito and Asuna will end up together. you want to know what\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll happen when Suguha\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true identity is revealed to him. You want to know if Kirito will be able to rescue Asuna before the ticking clock of the second story arc runs out. You want to know just how many people will die before their trials in SAO are finally safely over. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to get invested in these conflicts, which is probably the main reason so many people get hooked during their initial viewing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But with that tactic, SAO suffers a very significant trade-off in the form of some absolutely miserable rewatch value. Upon a second viewing, any viewer will already know exactly where the story is heading, and how each conflict will be resolved, which takes the suspense right out of the series\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Forcing you to admit just how weak and sexist the characterizations are, and how badly written a lot of the side stories are.\n\nSword Art Online is available from Aniplex. The officially released Region 1 DVDs were split into quarters, with each disk holding about 6-7 episodes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 For more than fifty dollars each. Yeah, in order to actually own a tangible copy of this entire twenty-five episode series with the English dub intact, you will have to shell out over two hundred dollars. Even if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a fan of the series, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not worth even half of that price. Luckily, there are other options available, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not just talking about the much more affordable Malaysian bootlegs on Ebay. You can find SAO on Crunchyroll, and at least for now, you can also find it for free on Netflix. The original light novels are currently being released in English alongside a translated manga adaptation, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve read the first volume of each, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re completely awful. Do not waste your time and money on them. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a second season too, but I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen it yet.\n\nOddly enough, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to pause for a moment to give a recommendation to an Abridged version of this series, by youtube user Something Witty Entertainment. Where most abridged shows will retcon personality traits out of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s characters for the sake of comedy and pacing. SAO Abrdiged does the exact opposite, turning Kirito into a sociopathic asshole and Asuna into an awkward, racially ignorant noob, and mother of all surprises, these new reprehensible personalities\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Coupled with some very strong writing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Actually make the characters more likeable than they are in the show proper. Events that happen to them also seem to matter a great deal more in terms of their character and relationship development, which is very believable. There are only eleven episodes out so far, and each episode takes a few months to release, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth the patience.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been told by a great many people that Sword Art Online does not accurately portray the MMO gaming experience, but speaking as someone who has never played an MMO in his life, I really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care. I came into this series looking for a good story, exciting action and memorable characters, and to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very minimal credit, SAO almost has those qualities. It has a definite cool factor in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concept and design, and it does as good a job as possible covering up it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lackluster content with outstanding production values and musical direction. I want to give it credit for presenting an emotionally gripping storyline, and while that storyline doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really hold up under repeated viewings, there are a handful of moments that are just as powerful no matter how many times you see them. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a mixed bag to be sure, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as terrible as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most fervent haters claim, nor is it the worst way to pass the time. I give Sword Art Online a 5/10."}, {"id": 3215, "score": 60, "body": "\n\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a fan of the nineties stop motion movie The Nightmare Before Christmas, your vision of a land based entirely on the tropes, designs and conventions of Halloween is a dark, depressing town where every single resident is ironically joyful and pleasant towards one another. Soul Eater, on the other hand, takes this idea and turns it over on it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head. Death City, for all of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s creeps and ghouls, is a bright, happy place where even the Grim Reaper is more of a cuddly uncle than a terrifying specter of doom. The Reaper, or Lord Death, as he prefers to be called, is the headmaster of the Death Weapon Meister Academy, a school that teaches young people how to join their souls to protect the world from witches!\n\nTo do this, one student must become a living weapon, and their chosen partner must wield them against creepy, devious witches who hide in the shadows and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Do stuff, like transforming into all manners of creepy creatures! Once each team has devoured the souls of 99 corrupted humans and one witch, they will be advanced to the status of Death Scythe, the preferred weapons of Grim Reapers everywhere. But one witch has decided to take matters into her own hands\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 She plans to awaken an ancient, sleeping demon that will drive the entire world past the brink of insanity! Can Meister Maka, her weapon Soul, and their friends stop this plan before it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too late, or will the world lose itself to the clutches of chaos?\n\nThe animation studio behind this heaping helping of Halloween was Studio Bones, the studio that gained fame from Fullmetal Alchemist and Wolf\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Rain. Like the majority of their projects, Soul Eater has solid, kinetic animation\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 About half the time. The animation is never quite as smooth or expensive as it is in the first season opening, but it is more or less solid for the most part. There are a few embarrassing moments, such as where characters look like their walk cycles were just copied and pasted onto the environment, but thankfully, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re few and far between. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s NOT few and far between are the still shots. There are several occurrences where a character is talking, but the camera is focused on the environment, other character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s faces, or just the eyes of the speaker, leaving the lip flaps off screen.\n\nThere are a lot of action and fighting scenes throughout this series, and the fact that most of the budget is saved for those scenes is a life saver in the long run. The editing and angles can be a bit too amateurish and generic for their own good at times, and there are way too many close-ups of characters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 faces, but it works over-all. The character designs are it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best visual aspect by far, although the highly detailed backgrounds are also noteworthy. There was so much inspiration and creativity in the aesthetic of this series that even the Grim Reaper is like no other reaper you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen before.\n\nAside from a couple of female background characters who are retroactively given names and identities in the later episodes, every single named character is given a unique and unforgettable look that goes beyond just their hairstyles and fashions. Some of them are grounded, some of them are insane, and you can tell instantly which witches are based on which animals. If you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen the anthropomorphic version of the legendary sword Excalibur\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Think Puttin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 On the Ritz from AMV Hell 5\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 You would never guess what he looks like or acts like in this series, as he has one of the most insane gimmicks in a series full of insane gimmicks.\n\nThe music\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I think existed? Well, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not fair. The music is decent in this series, but for the most part, it does it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job in the background, rarely ever calling attention to itself\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Which is good because trust me, a lot of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tracks are reused over and over again through the series. Besides, who cares about the score when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got such amazing opening and closing songs? The first opening is called Soul Resonance by TM Revolution, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the kind of high energy, intense tunes that grabs you the first time you hear it and demands you come back for more, and the animation in the video more than keeps up with it. The second opening is a bit more generic, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s serviceable enough. There are four closing themes, and while the first one (I Wanna Be) is probably the best, I still personally prefer the much more mellow second one, Style, as it offers the cool-down that I felt each episode needed. Your opinion on this may differ, which is fine\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all great closings, in their own ways.\n\nThe English dub was of course a Funimation effort\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been getting dangerously close to Disney levels of ubiquity at this point\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And while I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard some people call it average, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great. I can normally call out a star performer in any dub I review, but in Soul Eater\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case, there are just too many to pick from. Luci Christian rarely ever plays a villain\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Elfen Lied being one of the few examples\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But she plays the role of Medusa, school nurse/evil mastermind, and she clearly enjoyed every second of it. She sounds downright diabolical and as slithery as the snake she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s based on, even when she exploits her cutesier voices to mock or manipulate people. Troy Baker is unrecognizable as the pretentious nuisance Excalibur, and Vic Mignona excels in the role of an overly-enthusiastic dad who wants nothing more than the forgiveness of his estranged daughter.\n\nTodd Haberkorn brings out both the strength and neurotic tendencies of Lord Death\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son Death the Kid in the ways that only he ever could, Chuck Huber handles Dr. Stein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s insanity brilliantly, and Maxey Whitehead fully embodies the androgynous Crona through all of his/her psychotic, awkward nuances. Brittany Karbowski starts off a little roughly as Blackstar, the hyperactive ninja who makes Naruto look stealthy, and it can be a little difficult to take her seriously in the early episodes, but she hits her groove hard and fast. Laura Bailey and relative newcomer Micah Solusod play the main partnership of Maka and Soul as likeably as they can, although for the majority of the series, their jobs aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really as demanding as everyone elses. Pretty much every Funimation actor that was around in the late 2000s is in this at some point, and everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at least on point.\n\nSo after speaking so highly of the sound, acting and production values, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re probably expecting me to remain positive for the rest of the review. you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expecting me to keep rambling on about how awesome the series is, how well written it is, and how much I love it. Well, much like this series did to me, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to have to disappoint you. The truth is, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever encountered this large of a disparity between writing quality and popularity\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, not in the anime medium, at any rate. I can think of at least one web cartoon that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s far more popular, despite being even worse.\n\nTo begin, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take a look at the main characters. One of the easiest ways to pinpoint bad writing is to notice that a character who you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re constantly being told is smarter than the rest of the cast shows no actual signs of enhanced intelligence to back up that claim. In Death Note, we were given no explanation of Light Yagami\u00e2\u0080\u0099s study habits or scholastic strengths, but at least we knew he was good at strategy and manipulating people. In No Game No Life, the two stars made it very clear which of them was skilled in which areas, and we saw their talents unfold during some of the game sequences. In Soul Eater, there is no evidence whatsoever to support Maka being the top student at the Academy. She never uses her intellect during battle, and the only test question we see her answer is the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s line about sound minds and bodies. The only brainy thing she ever does is dump exposition on the viewer.\n\nAll of her accomplishments are due to her bond with Soul, rushing into situations courageously, and coming up with new attacks. We never see her outwit or outsmart anybody\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 She just resolves conflicts through the application of virtues such as bravery and friendship. But hey, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no big deal as long as the title character is interesting, right? Well, sorry, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not. Soul Eater, and yes that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s his alarmingly prophetic name, is a laid back cool guy who likes playing the piano\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty much it. I learned more about him from a single paragraph on Wikipedia than I did from a 52 episode series that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s specifically named after him. You never learn about his family, his backstory, or why he wants to become a Death Scythe in the first place.\n\nAnd that just brings up another problem I had with this series. We know what happens when a partnership achieves their goal of eating 99 corrupted\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Or, \u00e2\u0080\u009cKeishan\u00e2\u0080\u009d souls, and one witch soul\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The weapon becomes a Death Scythe. But what happens to the Meister? What do they get out of it? The only Meister in the series whom we know for sure was able to accomplish this was Maka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother, and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s off on a trip for the entire show. We know that pursuing this goal benefits the weapons, but we know nothing about what the Meisters get out of it. And what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really messed up about this is that in each of the three main partnerships in the cast\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Maka and Soul, Blackstar and Tsubaki, Death the Kid and the Thompson sisters\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The Meister side is always the more interesting side. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Meister that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s driven to succeed, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the weapon that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s there to support them and guide them to their dreams, and the Meister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s have much clearer motives than the weapons, so shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it be the Meisters who stand to accomplish something tangible?\n\nThere are a lot of people out there who say Soul Eater would have been great if it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for the ending, which strayed from the plot of the manga. Well, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never read the manga, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t intend to until after this review is done, because no adaptation should ever require the viewer to have knowledge of the original material in order to work. In my opinion, the worst thing about this show isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the ending, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the beginning. As many viewers have pointed out, the plot that this anime starts with is not the same as the plot it picks up towards the end. Now, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not necessarily a bad thing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Plot evolution can be handled well, just like it was in Toradora. But the plot has to actually evolve. The first plot must in some way become the second plot, otherwise it will feel like a waste of time. Which is exactly what it feels like here.\n\nOnly in soul Eater, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just a waste of time. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s far worse than that. Throughout the first several episodes of the series, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re given boatloads of exposition about how the Death Scythe system works, what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rules are, and why it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important. That exposition is handled about as well as it was in The Last Airbender. Another obvious sign of bad writing is when one character explains something to another character for the sake of the audience, but since both characters already know everything, the explanation is opened with the phrase \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs you know\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d And it gets worse than that, as the rules for having the souls you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve collected revoked(Ripped from your stomach?) sound arbitrary and downright draconian. And to make matters worse, the change in plot leave tons of questions unanswered, the worst of which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already gone into.\n\nAnd the exposition gets even worse as the series continues. In the second half, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an arc where the DWMA sends it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s students and teachers to a snowy location called the Lost Island. no, not that Lost Island. Not only is this expedition not foreshadowed or brought up in any way before we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re dropped right into it, but the pre-op portion of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first episode consists of Lord Death telling us\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yes, telling us, talking directly to the audience, as though the fourth wall never existed\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 about why they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going there and what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expecting to find. That should not happen. It should be set up in the dialogue, and it should occur seamlessly. Hell, even showing Maka and Soul in their dorm preparing for and discussing the mission would have felt less jarring, and it probably would have taken up just as much time. The world-building is so bad that I have no idea where Death City is located, and how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bizarre logic exists in a world whose locations so clearly mirror our own.\n\nAnd as for all the people saying the ending was the worst part of the series? I honestly thought the final quarter was the best one. Yeah, okay, the final battle was really weak, anti-climactic and full of deus ex machina BS, but it was the only stretch of episodes that felt like one smooth, connected story that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t veer off into filler episodes or unnecessarily complicated plot annexes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, for the most part. This part of the story does waste a disproportionate amount of time on a \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collect magical artifacts and expose the DWMA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dark secret\u00e2\u0080\u009d sub-plot, which is paid off in the stupidest way imaginable. I halfway want to just spoil it, because if I were to describe what that sub-plot and all the characters it introduced was leading to, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d probably think I was exaggerating. Spoiler alert: The school turns into a giant mech and tries to swat a giant robot spider. See? Unless you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen it, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe me! And all this time, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re constantly told that the awakened demon is causing outbreaks of insanity around the world, but we never actually see this happening!\n\nThe reason I love that section of the story above the others is because it advances the two plot elements that feel the strongest. The first one is the friendship between the seven main characters. The writers of this anime understood humans and emotions far more than they understood basic storytelling, and the relationship between the primary weapons and meisters are proof of that. When they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hanging out together, it feels like a comfortable party that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been invited to. When they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re fighting as a unit, their strengths and weaknesses complement each other perfectly. When they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re fighting among themselves, it feels tense, like there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s genuinely something at stake if they should go too far and disband. Every interaction, from the bond between the Thompson sisters to Blackstar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complex of inferiority to Death the Kid and Maka, is executed well. Even Maka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s issues with her cheating father are dealt with maturely.\n\nAnd the other element revolves around someone whom I consider to be the best character in the series, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s saving grace in a lot of respects: The snake witch, Medusa Gorgon. My god is she an amazing villain. Her motivation is basically evil for the sake of evil, but not in a lazy way\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 In a good way, like Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty or Johan from Monster. There is no act that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too diabolical for her to stoop to it. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also smart, staying one step ahead of everyone as much as possible and saddling both Soul and Stein with the very issues that make them interesting and memorable. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s such a great villain that she completely over-shadows the villain that succeeds her. The long term plot involving her evil schemes is by far the most fun to follow. These two plot elements are tied together perfectly by a character named Crona, but in the interest of not spoiling anything, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll say no more.\n\nAnd it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good thing these two elements exists, because holy crap is there a lot of unnecessary pulp in this show. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s constantly throwing new ideas and new characters at you, and it ultimately reaches the point where at least a dozen of them could have died for all I cared. It would be so easy to reduce this show to twenty six episodes without hurting it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strongest elements or losing the charm and personality that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s won so many otaku hearts. Because let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s be honest, how many of these characters and plot points are important in the long run? How many of them are so necessary to the story that they couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be either removed altogether, or written out with a few job reassignments?\n\nAs an experiment, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remove the plot point about becoming a death scythe, and just call the main characters witch hunters. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s get rid of pointless characters like Yumi, Joe, Hero, Arachne, Giriko, Eibon, Justin, Ox, Kilik, Kim, the younger Mizune sisters, and yes, even Excalibur. Characters who are only temporarily important, such as Sid, Mifune and Blair, can be kept long enough to perform the barest of plot essentials. Hell, as much as I loved Eruka Frog and Free, they could have just been eaten when Asura woke up. Entire episodes could be scrapped, with their relevance to the magical item hunt removed. Take these changes into account, tighten up a few loose ends with some quick rewrites, and this story could have been reduced to twenty six episodes with a much better sense of pace and direction.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a good sign.\n\nAs Maka tells us at the beginning of every episode, a sound soul dwells within a sound mind and a sound body. Soul Eater has neither a sound mind OR a sound body, and thus, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a sound series. Even so, I guess I am underselling the parts of this show that work. Soul Eater is a lot of fun.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very unique and creative, and even in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more pointless moments, it has a great sense of humor. The chibi sight gags that were easily the weakest part of BOTH FMA adaptations is used to much better effect here. I can drone on forever about just how terribly, terribly written it is, but the things it does right are strong enough that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still worth returning to for multiple viewings.\n\nSoul Eater is available from Funimation. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been released in several different DVD sets, including 13 episode quarter sets, 26 episode half sets, and finally, a much more affordable complete set, and more recently, a premium Blu-Ray set, as though Funi hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wrung enough money out of us just yet. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be honest, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d hate to be one of the people who spent 60 dollars apiece for each of the quarter sets, only to see the price drop so rapidly over the course of less than ten years. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also up for free on Netflix. The manga is available stateside from Yen Press. A spin-off manga called Soul Eater Not is also available stateside, and an anime adaptation was released in Japan last spring, and since then, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also been released stateside by Funimation, and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interesting.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth a test drive.\n\nSo, I was originally going to give this series a 5/10, and in fact I DID give it a 5/10 on MAL, but it just felt like the wrong thing to do ever since.  And since then, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had the displeasure of watching Soul Eater Not, and my opinion on the older series has changed a bit as a result.  See, Soul Eater fails at a lot of things, and I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t justify ignoring them, but in the end, it only failed because it TRIED so many things.  No, Not! isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as much of a mess, but it was also more safe and generic of a story\u00e2\u0080\u00a6  A tried and true high school girls story, with lesbian teasing, friendship messages and a villain tacked on at the end.  Soul Eater didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try to be safe, and it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be so damned influential if it hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t taken so many bold risks, and I have to give it credit for that.  It may not have a sound mind or body, but if nothing else, it has a sound heart, which is enough justification for me to give Soul Eater a 6/10.  "}, {"id": 3216, "score": 50, "body": "Chihiro Furuya has no interest in the opposite sex. This is of course far from uncommon in the anime world, as male protagonists often act chaste and reject the conventions of romantic or sexual attraction, but the difference with Chihiro is that he has an actual reason\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been obsessed with zombie fiction for as long as he can remember, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been on the look out for a certain kind of girl that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just drop dead gorgeous\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 That is to say, a hot zombie chick. One day, after finding a mysterious ink-splatted book about resurrecting the dead in his attic, his precious pet cat Babu is run over by a local man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s car, killing the freaky feline instantly. Not yet ready to part with one of his only friends, Chihiro begins to study the old book, and begins to experiment with the potion listed inside of it, crafting different variations of the same concoction to try and find that one sweet mix that will bring Babu back to life. Of course he can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do this at home, so he chooses an abandoned hotel as his makeshift mad science lab\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where he meets Rea.\n\nAs one of the most popular girls in school and the daughter of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s owner, you might expect her to live a happy and privileged life, fulfilling and free of want, with nary a care in the world that wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fall under the term \u00e2\u0080\u009cFirst world problems.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You would be wrong, as the lifestyle of this rich and famous heiress is closer to that of a detainee than that of a debutante. Putting up with her Father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soul-crushing over-protection and her Mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s alcohol-influenced indifference, she finds Chihiro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weirdness to be a pleasant diversion, and winds up becoming the Igor in his experiments. Unbeknownst to them, he actually manages to perfect the potion, so when she secretly steals a vial of it to end her own life with, she soon winds up becoming the one thing he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always wanted\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 A living dead girl. But with her psychopathic father waiting for the perfect moment to strike, and her own mysterious condition presenting them with challenges at every turn, is there any hope for their boy-meets-ghoul romance? Or like Rea, are they simply living on borrowed time?\n\nOnce upon a time, I came across somebody in the forums I frequent, denouncing Studio Deen as the worst animation company he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ever seen. He showed a mediocre-looking clip from the first episode of Fate/Stay Night, calling it \u00e2\u0080\u009cliterally the best looking thing they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever done.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll admit that that Deen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s put out a few ass-looking anime before, but I was quick to show him clips from a few shows that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d specially selected to show just how amazing some of their shows can look\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And one of them was Sankarea, which had just begun to air on Funimation.com. I selected this particular title for one specific reason\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Because the animation in this series is nothing short of perfect.\n\nNow, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get me wrong\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 We are of course not talking about constant fluid motion, like what you may find in the best looking Kyoto Animation shows\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 On-screen movement is restricted to what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s necessary, but it never feels like they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re being held back by anything other than their own discretion. When the movement does slow down, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost always for the sake of an emotionally significant moment, at which point it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more like the visuals stepping back and letting you become engrossed in the shock and gravity that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supposed to be experiencing, which is further amplified by the exquisite art design and brilliant use of sound effects. This gives the series a sense of energy and atmosphere that can, at times, make you feel as though you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really there in the moment alongside the characters.\n\nFor the most part, the art design is rooted firmly in reality\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, blonde Japanese girls with large breasts aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly realistic, but you could consider that the exception that proves the rule. Everything from a field of flowers to a row of trees to your basic urban settings are drawn with elaborate detail down to the very last blemish, arranged on screen with strict adherence to attractive color palettes and in ways that draw your eyes directly to the human characters living out their lives in the midst of it all. Having said that, the use of off-beat camera angles and just plain weird shot set-ups doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always work, and can at times feel a little over-excessive, like they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying way too hard to look like Studio Shaft, who can be extremely hit or miss in terms of visuals in their own right. Some occurrences deserve to be explored from less commonplace angles, but when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to spice up a conversation in a locker room by having three characters open up their lockers as though they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re practicing their timing for a synchronized swimming meet, the show can start to look a little pretentious. The character designs are also a bit strange, despite the mostly realistic body proportions\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I will never for the life of me understand why old people are often portrayed as little people\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And then there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the main character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cat-like hairdo, which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure has some sort of symbolic meaning in regards to his zombie cat. Rea looks like the stereotypical standard of young Japanese beauty, and while I would be crying \u00e2\u0080\u0098generic\u00e2\u0080\u0099 over it, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an argument to be made that her father simply raised her to look like that.\n\nThe opening and ending portions are just beautiful. The OP, Esoragoto by nano.Ripe, is one of my favorites of all time for some damn good reasons. Aside from the throwaway side-character breakdown that happens at about 45 seconds in, the imagery used in this opening is full of metaphors for the story of the anime, none of which you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll understand until probably your second time through. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very subtle in the way they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re presented, and the childish voice singing the lyrics perfectly emphasizes the tragedy of a young adolescent who was never truly allowed to experience childhood, and thus hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been allowed to grow up. The ending, Above Your Hand by Annabel, takes that idea to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s natural conclusion\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Rea in a bowling alley, what one might consider the ideal teen hangout, just lying in the lane and waiting to get struck, knowing she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never truly live and patiently, serenely awaiting death to take her. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good reason the singer sounds older here than in the OP\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the harsh reality to the op\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unsettlingly upbeat fantasy.\n\nIn keeping with these thematic ideals, Yukari Hashimoto composed the soundtrack to hit two major notes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 One decidedly better than the other. Half of the OST explores the emotional trauma faced by Rea\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The exact nature of which is betrayed by an array of music box, organ and piano orchestrations. The other half is tailored more towards Chihiro, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a reason nobody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going out of their way to upload them on youtube. These tunes skew more towards the background, and have a much more homey feel to them\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They can be downright happy and disarming, and while they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re perfectly fine in their own right, the emotional resonance of the stronger half of the soundtrack does tend to attract more attention. Personally, my favorite is Babu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s theme, Babu no Iru Fuukei, which just sounds like the anthem of a cat strutting around town without a care in the world, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surprisingly easy to dance to.\n\nThe English dub is also top notch, which shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t surprise you if you look at the list of names involved before viewing. The backstage work is in the hands of the right people, with Joel McDonald directing and Monica Rial writing the script, two choices you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go wrong with. Jamie Marchi stayed the hell away from the script, which is also to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great credit, as she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a far better actor than she is a writer. She plays Chihiro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cousin Ranko, and while she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s played more than her fair share of loud, energetic girls, her character has a great deal more emotional depth than your typical incest-obsessed cousin cliche, and Marchi makes you genuinely feel for this character who would probably come off as annoying in anyone else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands. David Wald, whom I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m convinced can do no wrong, plays Rea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s creepy father, bringing forth an air of pride and nobility, with some heavily unsettling tones lurking just beneath the surface.\n\nMonica Rial is of course adorable as a zombie cat, as is Felecia Angelle, who plays Chihiro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ghost-obsessed sister Mero with the perfect deadpan sarcasm. However, the real surprise here is with our two leads, Chihiro and Rea. Ever since Aaron Dismuke hit puberty, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found his performances to be extremely hit-or-miss, but he was luckily able to play off of his own obsession with zombies to play his strange, socially awkward character. His performance could be described as one note, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the kind of one-note an introverted teenager would believably use, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more than capable of emoting through it whenever he needs to. And what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more shocking is that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve NEVER liked Tia Ballard, the high-pitched banshee who ruined the first episode of Shiki for me. But in the title role of Rea Sanka, there are no words for how amazing she is. She shows an unbelievable amount of control over her voice, and is able to put forth consistent quality whether her character is cheerful, suffering, or going through rigor mortis(her approach to which is hilarious). When she goes into her backstory, her expository dialogue can be downright heartbreaking, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear she feels all the pain in her character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart. She can come off as a bit too whiny and spoiled at some points in the story, but I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really fault the actor for that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It is, unfortunately, the way the character was written.\n\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that? You think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weird for a girl who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been established as an abuse victim to be portrayed as annoying and spoiled? Well, get ready for worse, because this show is really freaking weird. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not referring to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concept, either\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 This is one of the most bafflingly executed anime series I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen. It has no sense of tone, it constantly shoots itself in the foot with it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lack of focus, and seemingly has no idea what it wants to be. Is it an intense, dramatic character study? Is it a light-hearted slice of life with an unusual premise? Is it a tongue-in-cheek love letter to the zombie genre? Hell, it could be all of those things without feeling nearly as jarring\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Comedy, drama and off-kilter subject matter has been handled expertly in shows like Ouran Highschool Host Club\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but Sankarea just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand how.\n\nOur central character is Chihiro, a zombie obsessed boy who immediately gains your attention via some subtle hints that he actually doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want a zombie girlfriend, and is only saying that as an excuse to himself as others as to why he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not yet mature enough to be interested in girls. He lives in a house with what could almost be called a Japanese Addams Family, has a dead cat he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trying to resurrect, which(along with his own cat-like appearance) could be a metaphor that he desperately wants to get a life himself. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the better male protagonists I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen, but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s immediately over-shadowed by the lead female, Rea. Not long after she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s introduced, we start to hear her sad tale, and it is so bizarrely horrifying that it winds up hijacking the story. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like hearing about a triplegic puppy who just found out it has another case of leg cancer, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that merciless of an attack on your sympathies.\n\nAt first, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re told that her father takes naked pictures of her on her birthday, which she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sick of. Yeah, that sounds like a spoiler, but we find it out in the first episode, so whatever. Then we find out that he shelters and controls her, firing any maid who he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t agree with, possibly killing a stray cat that got too close to the house, and using his influence to destroy the lives of the family of a girl she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d confided to about the pictures. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bad enough, but as the story goes on, we also learn some things that are supposed to make him feel more sympathetic, but they just wind up making the situation feel all the more sinister. I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give away the spoiler that reveals this, but it becomes evident by the end of the series(to anybody who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really paying attention) that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s planning to start engaging in a physical relationship with her as soon as she turns 16. Hell, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an OVA episode where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heavily implied that he takes extra naked pictures of her that DON\u00e2\u0080\u0099T wind up in the official collection.\n\nEvery time I watch this series, my heart feels heavy for Rea, and the tone of the series at that point is appropriately crushing. But that tone starts to fade, and by the time she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s become a zombie, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all but gone. We go right back to silly, weird slice of life zom-com fare. It feels like you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching a different show, and the worst of it has to be the gratuitous fan-service. Now, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get me wrong, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got nothing against animated nudity. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m no prude with that kind of thing, and if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done well, I welcome it. But Sankarea is that rare title where it just feels like a horrible, misguided idea. Remember, we just got through a soul-crushing backstory where it was firmly established that the exploitation of her naked body is supposed to feel sick and wrong. Why not follow this up with pointless shower scenes(she even states that she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need them because she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sweat) where she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s confusedly squeezing a loofa between her boobs and getting comedically attacked by an old man? Yeah, they use her hair as a source of convenient censoring, and even if they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t she has no nipples for us to ogle(which is strange, because Ranko definitely does), but it still feels wrong. It starts to feel like the writers and animators, and by extension the audience, are no better than her father.\n\nNow, it is of course possible to start an anime on an emotionally turbulent note and still have it be a comedy. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not an immediately terrible idea, but you have to commit in some way to both sides of the story. In Kotoura-san, we follow a telepathic girl as she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not supposed to be able to read minds, so she unknowingly alienates her friends and destroys her own family by revealing peoples\u00e2\u0080\u0099 secrets to each other. She grows up depressed and cynical, until she meets a group of friends who are willing and eager to accept her for who she is, and even though she has many hilarious misadventures with them, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re never spared the psychological effects of her unfortunate childhood and the damage that she has to overcome, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re terrified of what will happen when her mother re-enters the story. See? This sort of thing can be executed well, but you have to work to MAKE IT WORK. Kotoura is a hilarious show, but her psychological trauma is never played for laughs, just like Rea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body should never have been exploited for cheap fan service.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy enough to accept anime fanservice as a natural element of the medium, but if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to take the very idea of a female character being objectified by the male gaze to such a dark place, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just go back to silly cheesecake.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gone under anyway, you might as well throw some depth at us.\n\nWell, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like Sankarea doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the most frustrating thing about it. It has depth, but it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what the fuck to DO with it. First of all, this series is a subversion of the magical girlfriend genre, a style of story where a male protagonist who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unlucky in love receives a female companion who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perfect for him through supernatural means, and likely has to teach her an unspecified amount of stuff about the world around them, while she finds fulfillment in simply being his waifu. Sankarea is the zombie version of this, which is a welcome diversion compared to the homogeny of the genre. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s found happiness in death that she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have in life, although this is eventually shelved so the story can focus on exploring the physical properties of zombies in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s canon. Frankly, I would have loved to see the trope humanized further by having Rea get uncomfortable with Chihiro filming her for research, as such an activity would probably remind her of her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photo sessions.\n\nBut while we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on the subject of Chihiro and Rea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dad, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a whole other can of worms lurking in that subject. A few times during the series, Chihiro reflects on how he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no better than her Dad, because he keeps her locked up in the house. This serves as a convenient reason for him to take her on some walks around town, but what the anime fails to realize is that the similarities go a lot deeper than that. Yeah, they both keep her locked up, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also worth mentioning that she symbolizes an unusual fetish for each of them, and also that they both value her primarily as a triumph of life over the tragedy of death\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Chihiro loves her because she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a zombie who literally came back from the dead, and Rea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father loves her for certain spoiler reasons. Aside from those rare moments of lucidity that I mentioned before, Sankarea never capitalized on these things, forgoing a wealth of possible depth in exchange for an ending that begs for an unlikely sequel and a resolution that deals with Rea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father almost as poorly as Akihiko was dealt with in Sword Art Online.\n\nSo is Sankarea a bad show? Well\u00e2\u0080\u00a6  Kind of. I hate to say that, because while there are a lot of negative aspects to the writing and execution of the series, most of them are more like missed opportunities than actual flaws. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like I said before, this is just a really weird show all around, and it can make for a bewildering experience, regardless of what you were expecting from it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overuse of cliches can be irritating, especially when it comes to Chihiro having basically the same two best friends that Kyon from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and several other protagonists have had, but it manages to cast more of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cliches in an interesting and fresh light than not. Hell, even the incest-crazy cousin is way more sympathetic and relatable than she should be, by any convention. Honestly? I just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but enjoy it in all of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flaws, just because of how bizarre it is.\n\nSankarea is available from Funimation. It was originally released as the censored TV cut, but was later released uncensored, although if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m being totally honest, if you can save some money by picking the censored version, you probably should. There really isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that much difference between them. For the extra money you get a couple shots of zombified Rea with her guts hanging out, as well as no more than 30 collective seconds of uncensored nudity that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll barely miss. The uncensored version is cheaper now than when it was released, going for thirty-five bucks instead of sixty, but you can still find copies of the censored version floating around Ebay for ten to fifteen bucks. The original manga is available stateside from Kodansha entertainment, and while I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t read it, it apparently offers a more complete story. It has a few OVAs, and while one of them made it onto the DVD set as an episode, the other two did not, and are not available stateside.\n\nSankarea is far from perfect, but I still have to stick to my guns on one thing I said two years ago\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the best zombie anime I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d seen at the time, although it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s since been dethroned by School Live.  It creates it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own logic from scratch instead of clumsily trying to reinterpret and reinvent the existing logic, choosing to paint the many established zombie lores as the works of fiction that they are. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s love of the zombie sub-genre and dedication towards being a new and distinctive entry into said sub-genre is what ties the series together with a note of other-wise sorely lacking consistency, and to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s credit, the off-kilter execution just serves as one more thing that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unique about it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bigger problems are a little too serious to ignore, and there are parts of it that feel jarring and uncomfortable, but I really like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brand of weirdness, and would easily recommend it to anyone who loves zombies, but is sick and tired of watching the same old genre fare. Even as a Halloween title, it might not be for everyone, but with it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s high production values, offbeat campiness and unwavering devotion to the undead, I still recommend checking it out. Unfortunately, when the title of \u00e2\u0080\u009cHalloween treat\u00e2\u0080\u009d is removed, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not very good.  I give Sankarea a 5/10."}, {"id": 3222, "score": 55, "body": "_\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0099\u00ab\u00e2\u0099\u00ab\u00e2\u0099\u00ab When you try your best but you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t succeed\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\nWhen you get what you want, but not what you need\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 \u00e2\u0099\u00ab\u00e2\u0099\u00ab\u00e2\u0099\u00ab\u00e2\u0080\u009d_\n\nEmotions play a powerful part in storytelling; holding the capacity to tell more through expressions than words could ever hope to achieve. Furthermore, the degree of sentimentality and pathos one feels when watching is able to override any logical fallacies or flaws a story may have. Because of their poignant effect, these \u00e2\u0080\u009cfeels\u00e2\u0080\u009d are often used and abused by anime to hide a plethora of writing problems underneath obvious emotional manipulation on the viewers. But whilst there are shows that come off mawkish and melodramatic, there are certainly those where sentiment is deserved. Violet Evergarden is the most recent anime that struck a chord with the community, practically built as a masterpiece before the first episode was even released and I could see why: an award-winning light novel getting an adaptation by Kyoto Animation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a studio adored for their gorgeous art style and animation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 sounds like a perfect match to many. But does Violet Evergarden live up to its expectations? And, perhaps more importantly, is the emotional ride warranted?\n\nViolet Evergarden follows a titular young girl whose purpose was to be nothing more than a weapon bred for war; a dog of the military, actions akin to a beast fighting for survival. She was never taught how to speak, write or communicate at all, only to kill. Treated as property by the military she was gifted to Gilbert, a major in the army who feels sorry for her, taking it upon himself to teach her valuable skills so that someday she may live the life of a normal girl. As time goes on their relationship grows stronger with her initial animalistic nature subdued and instead displays a more robotic-like behaviour in public. A romance between the two also brews, but their responsibility as soldiers of war takes priority and their affection for each other forced into stagnation. Unfortunately, war holds no mercy on the battlefield and results in Gilbert\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death. His last words: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI love you\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 words that she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand from the man who gave her the name of a wildflower in bloom, Violet.\n\nThe aforementioned acts as backstory to the main plotline that is not revealed until later, whereas the series begins with the aftermath: Violet is found in hospital, bed-ridden with prosthetic arms. The war is over and her purpose fulfilled, now she must adopt a civilian lifestyle. She meets Claudia, a former army commander who had befriended Gilbert during the war and is now president of a postal company that provides mail and ghost-writer services. Initially hired as a postal worker, she witnesses how the ghost-writer department works and wishes to become an Auto Memory Doll \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a ghost-writer for those unable to write in order to learn the meaning of words and the feelings of others. The beginning is honestly a poor first impression, coming off sappy, predictable and acts as a shoddy introduction to each of the characters. Violet especially comes off almost insufferable here; her backstory is barely referred to with most of the details left in the dark, effectively throwing viewers into her moment of crisis without any proper context. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a perplexing choice on behalf of the staff, considering that Violet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personality here leaves her a bland, dreary main character to follow from the start, lacking enough reason to care about her struggles to begin with. This is made worse with how the story begins at such a slow pace, making it hard to judge whether the show is worth continuing. However, Violet Evergarden is not a show that should be judged from first impressions, as there certainly is merit to be found.\n\nOver the next few episodes Violet finds herself working and learning from other Auto Memory Dolls from their interactions with clients. The contrast between Violet and her fellow workers easily shows how far Violet truly is from her goal: currently emotionless and blank in her interactions, yet her desire and drive to understand the clients shines across the screen. This is further touched upon as Violet attends a training school and is unable to convey one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feelings onto a letter. On her own, she is still unable to properly recognise emotions, but through those around her she slowly begins to grasp what they feel and how they express such. Here Violet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bland personality acts like a blank canvas where those around her can leave their mark on her, allowing for parallels between side characters and herself to cause short instances of growth in Violet and a resolution on the side-character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behalf. However, the show is never able to capitalize on these instances well. Rather than take adequate time and focus to let these small but important moments have appropriate build-up and climax to truly have a resonant effect, the show just treats them as merely parts of the plot that could very well be considered isolated from each other, devaluing each achievement Violet makes in her development as the show goes on. I personally found it appalling with how Violet finally learns to effectively convey feelings in an extremely short and concise letter, then not even a few episodes later she is extremely proficient in her writing. If only writing IRL was that easy \u00e2\u0098\u00b9\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at this point where the pacing takes a sudden shift and the shows changes to an episodic format, focusing on Violet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s travels away from her workplace for different clients, each with their own set of issues to overcome, but all revolve around the idea of awakening their true feelings. As an Auto Memory Doll her job is to help her clients express what they feel, but here Violet sees the inner conflict present and aims for them to address and come to terms with it, with her acting as a catalyst when necessary. Whilst doing so, Violet continues to gain more appreciation for different forms of communication and gradually shows more signs of human behaviour. Her facial expressions able to tell more and more with each passing episode. It also gives a greater sense of the importance of society learning to feel again, accepting the tender aspects of individuals and its value. Relearning traits such as kindness, compassion and knowing how to best care about each other, so that when her time comes, Violet will be able to do the same for the own problems. Knowing this, these episodes should be lovely short stories to sit through, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the case. The way emotions are expressed here sound all well on paper, but in practice come off sterile \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a \u00e2\u0080\u009cclinical\u00e2\u0080\u009d sense with how an entire spectrum of emotions are presented. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s certainly logical reasoning behind why each feeling is portrayed, but as a viewer, these sensations are only being observed, never experienced. A sense of detachment always lingering beyond the screen, breaking any chance to bond with what is happening in the narrative. The series never tries to be melodramatic in its attempts of sentiment and I can respect that; through sheer visual flare it seeks to emulate like none before it, only to end up feeling artificial for the rest of the show.\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to get passionate about a series like this with such a lack of connection, but following Violet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s journey to self-discovery holds enough value that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth mentioning. Understanding her background and circumstances is crucial in understanding what Violet Evergarden is trying to achieve. She is initially a tool for battle, completely devoid of human emotion and understanding, simply bred to kill. It is only when she is away from the battlefield where she is aware of her apathetic nature and slowly starts to change. Her development can come off sappy, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s justified here in my eyes; slowly grasping how to sympathize and feel for others regardless of her actions in the past. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a war with herself, can her bloodstained hands really be used to help others? Is she worthy to? Constantly told she is on fire, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when she finally learns about her former lover\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death does the burning sensation set in and eat away at her soul. She gives in to despair and unsuccessfully tries to end her own life. Just when hope looks bleak, she finds a letter sent specifically to her. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s her colleagues; they miss her. Violet decides to help deliver letters at night, and witnesses the people that anxiously wait for these letters. Cheerful, elated to receive words from those they care about, their emotions key to her understanding her newfound purpose as a ghost-writer. Her hands that destroyed so much \u00e2\u0080\u0093 can now bring people together. While the supporting characters will come and go at the drop of a dime, it is Violet who blossoms through the show.\n\nThe production of Violet Evergarden is constantly praised for the exquisite animation and beautiful art design, both of which are well deserved. Kyoto Animation once again prove why they are one of the best in the industry and raise the standard for TV animation to new heights. Everything looks beautiful\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 almost too beautiful. The fluid animation, impressive character designs and attention to detail are all obviously here, but I would not consider it all to be a positive. Violet Evergarden draws a fine line between breathtaking beauty and over-stylization; scenes are \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo overloaded\u00e2\u0080\u009d with their artwork and digital effects, with the first few episodes smothered in excessive brightness, chromatic aberration and filters than hinder the great animation on display. When a pen is dropped, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just fall, it descends in dramatic fashion! It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overwhelming. Part of the problem falls to the directing which is just blatantly amateurish at times, as if the man in charge is unable to grasp feelings himself. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a natural beauty to be found in subtlety when it comes to emotionally-driven shows that Violet Evergarden lacks. The need to present itself in such grandiose fashion manages to expose itself to how amateur the artistic choices taken are; techniques such as depth of field and time-lapse photography are used with the sole purpose being imitation to previous works that did them better. Don't get me wrong, Violet Evergarden still looks visually pleasing, but rather than a home-grown garden gleaming with a myriad of colourful flora, the flowers are plastic, and knowing such loses its lustre.\n\nSo, with having finished Violet Evergarden, my thoughts are as followed: I rarely laughed, I never cried and this certainly will not change my life, but there is value here worthy of one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s admiration. While it lacks on an emotional level to most, the intent is pure and still holds a sense of beauty that deserves to be seen. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a nice show one can easily sit through to pass time, but unfortunately I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say much more. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a shame that for a story aimed at learning empathy, this message never reaches past the screen. For it desperately wishes to be as perfect an emotional experience can be, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the stories holding imperfections that have the most powerful impact. "}, {"id": 3224, "score": 60, "body": "In the distant future of 2006, Mankind had only recently made it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first steps towards exploring the vast reaches of space. Well, that, or it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2016 and we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even set foot on Mars yet, you can pick which world line sounds cooler. Anyway, with huge advancements in our understanding and manipulation of quantum physics, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve managed to evolve our technology to the point where we can effortlessly cruise through our own Solar System, from the Milky Way to the outer reaches, to new and as-of-yet unidentified planets lurking right outside the range of our telescopes. But as we begin to take our greedy first steps outside of our own cozy little system, we make a much more sobering discovery\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Giant space bugs have been destroying entire systems by laying eggs in their stars, which gives a whole new meaning to sunny-side up.\n\nAmong their first targets was the fleet being led by The Luxion, which was in turn piloted by the heroic Admiral Yuzo Takaya\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 A man who gave his life to make sure his entire crew could make it home safely. This cowardly 2015 ambush orphaned his daughter Noriko, who decided on the spot that she would follow in his footsteps, and train to become a pilot herself, so that she could either find him and save him, or in the worst case scenario, avenge his death. Now, alongside her perfectionist senior classmate Kazumi Amano, a soviet pilot named Jung Freud and their gruff Coach, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up to Noriko Takaya to overcome her deeply rooted inferiority complex and realize her destiny as the hero of the human race, who\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 If she succeeds\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Will remember her even 12,000 years in the future!\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to look at an anime from the eighties and pick on it for looking sub-par. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done it myself, despite the vast differences that exist between then and now in terms of budget, technology and artistic resources. The reason I do this is that even back then, it was entirely possible for an anime to look really damn good, and Gunbuster is one of the most reliable examples of this. There are plenty of static shots in this show where there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no movement on screen save for the flapping lips of the featured characters, because of course there are, but between these shots, there is not one piece of motion in this show that looks cheap or stilted. The animation is consistently fluid, save for perhaps one or two nude scenes that the animators got a little clumsy at. But hey, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about Gainax here, an it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s believable that most people on staff wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what a naked woman looks like.\n\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say the series doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s age, of course\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The space battles and mecha action are so well-animated that they hold up pretty well even today, but the art style is firmly rooted in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time. Characters look far more realistic in proportion than the moe-models of today, despite the enlargened eyes on our teenaged protagonists. The mechs are nothing to write home about, as they look disappointingly bland compared to even the existing mechs of it;s time, especially with Gundam preempting it by almost ten years. The military uniforms are pretty authentic looking for the men, and the leotards the girls where strike an impressive balance between being sexy enough for viewers, but also just barely professional enough to not be distracting from the tone. The aliens, when you actually see them, look awesome, and are by far the visual wonder of the series.\n\nThe music was composed by Koihei Tanaka, and the soundtrack as a whole is awesome. The main voice actors pooled together to sing quite a few original songs for the series, including the opening theme Active Heart and insert songs like the electrifying fight theme Fly High. Unfortunately, the instrumental compositions are a little bit bland and easily forgettable, as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pretty sure I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard them all in other shows, either repeated verbatim across the Gainax library or tweaked for similar shows. The opening song is awesome, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid the accompanying video is mostly a collection of shots from the show, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little to be said about that. There really isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any dub to speak of, although I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard rumors of one coming, but the sub is more than serviceable on it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own, with a lot of great acting and emotion behind each performance. Most of the cast members have very impressive credits to their names.\n\nOne of the unique joys of reviewing older anime is that you get to compare it to all the titles that came afterwards, and figure out what ways it affected the genre, as well as how many titles it may have inspired. Gunbuster, like many of Gainax\u00e2\u0080\u0099s early projects, actually inspired quite a few anime over the past 28 years. There are two ways an anime can show inspiration\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, actually there are more than that, but only two of them are presently relevant. The first is when an anime becomes really financially successful, so a bunch of other studios try to rip it off to copy it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success. There are many examples of titles that tried to do this to Madoka Magica, Azumanga Daioh, Lucky Star, Berserk, Haruhi Suzumia and Evangelion, to name a few. But then there are other examples, when an older anime is really heavily flawed, and the shows it influences actually manage to improve upon it in unimaginable ways. Two years ago, I mentioned this was the case with that train wreck His and Hers Circumstances, so\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Where does Gunbuster lie?\n\nWell, for starters, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s look at the title that I feel borrowed the most from Gunbuster\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Battle Athletes Victory. Yeah, I know you were expecting me to say Evangelion, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to that later. Gunbuster starts off with a very simple story\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 We have a teenage girl who enlisted with a training program so she could one day ascend to Outer Space and follow in the footsteps of their deceased parent. She encounters hard times, and doubts her abilities, which are noticeably behind where they should be. An older rival with top-tier grades is miffed by this, and says some things that shake our heroine down to her foundation. She learns how to improve through hard work, and winds up leaving her best friend behind to travel into outer space with her rival, whom now has more respect for her. This is literally the plot of Gunbuster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first episode, and Victory\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first TEN episodes.\n\nYes, the first episode of Gunbuster has the exact same plot as the first ten episodes of another series that bears some other striking similarities to it, all the way down to the student\u00e2\u0080\u0099s athletic attire. So which approach worked better? Well, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try not to talk too much about Battle Athletes Victory too much, as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m planning to review it in the future, but suffice to say, the story and characters have infinitely more meat attached to them than they did in the original, and even though it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ten times the length, very little of it could be called filler. It had several extra characters, each one unique and important in their own way, to the point that even the heroine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rival had her own rival, as well as a heart breaking backstory that explains her to a T. This is to say nothing of the heroine herself, whose plight is far more compelling.\n\nNoriko and Kazumi aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bad characters by far, but if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m being completely honest, there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much to them. We know that Kazumi is prideful and headstrong, and her doubt in Noriko serves the main character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s development, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know her family, her history, her drive, her dreams, her outlook on life\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 All of which are clear with Victory\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Jessie Gurtland. Noriko is a bit more developed, but after she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s told to work hard and not give up, she just instantly starts doing so and improving. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bit of realism to this, as the elapsed time shows that improvement isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t an immediate thing, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little to no psychological complexity to it.\n\nAkari Kanzaki had a far deeper problem, as her inferiority wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a mere complex, but a security blanket. By convincing herself that she was incapable of succeeding, she was sabotaging herself. She had an excuse not to try, and thus she had an excuse not to fail. She had to hit rock bottom before her best friend was able to beat some sense into her, and even at that point, she still wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t done developing, because said friend had become her new security blanket, which left her beyond devastated when that blanket was no longer available to her. Yes, the obstacles Noriko had to overcome were very clearly defined, and her improvement was paced well within the episode, but it was also incredibly vague, and the fact that almost every single training animation in the first episode had NOTHING to do with space combat didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help. Victory went there, and portrayed the character with a kind of intimacy that no amount of fanservice can deliver.\n\nBut is it fair to judge a 1988 series by a set of standards that wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be established for almost ten years? Yes and no. No, because obviously the medium of story-telling has to evolve over time, but also yes, because Battle Athletes Victory didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cause the problems in Gunbuster, it just called attention to them. Nobody jumps to defend Snow White and Cinderella just because modern Disney movies tend to contain more active and complex princesses\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yes, they were fine in their own time, but times have changed, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re far more likely in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s era to see those films judged by today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s standards. Likewise, the main characters of Gunbuster are nothing but chump change compared to the ones from Victory.\n\nAnd yes, you can blame the six episode format for this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, four episodes and a two-part conclusion that was literally an after-thought\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But just because development and pacing issues can be excused, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean they should be forgiven, especially when we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re coming to the part of this review where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have to take off our nostalgia goggles and admit a hard, sad truth to ourselves\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Gunbuster just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very good. Yeah, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry, but it still has numerous problems that a limited episode count can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be blamed for. The story is competently told for the most part, but as it goes on, it keeps on hitting more and more problems, as the cracks in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s writing become clearer and clearer. There are so many missed opportunities that other shows would have jumped on without hesitation, especially if it meant adding dramatic depth to the story and plot.\n\nIn episode 2, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re introduced to the third girl in the main cast, who we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be referring to as Russian Asuka, because another reviewer already called dibs on calling her Prototype Asuka. She challenges Kazumi to battle, causing them to go awol and accidentily discover a very unnerving secret about the military. The three of them get put on probation for this, and despite all of the material a good writer could have squeezed out of not only that secret but even the probation situation, neither plot point is ever brought up again. One sloppy looking nude bathing scene later, all is forgotten. The story would not have changed even a little bit if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never been caught, or were just let off the hook completely, or if their discovery had been a bunch of lost frisbees on top of the ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s roof, nothing would have changed.\n\nAnd remember when I brought up Evangelion? Well, episode three is the poor man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Kaoru episode. And for the record, the original Kaoru episode was ALREADY the poor man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Kaoru episode. In the space of about half of an episode, Noriko meets a dude, gets conveniently dumped by Kazumi, and then finds herself overwhelmed in combat when her love interest and current combat partner dies as a result. Feeling guilty for this (As she damn well should), she sits out the next battle, even though she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suddenly exactly the soldier they need to save everyone. She picks herself up by her bootstraps, joins the fight, saves the day, and it all feels so empty. The story is so rushed that we know about as much about Noriko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s love interest as we did about her rival\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Nothing. Hell, even Shinji\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bullshit \u00e2\u0080\u009cI love myself now\u00e2\u0080\u009d shtick was more compelling than Noriko just getting her act together out of nowhere because the plot demanded it.\n\nBut the space fighting is cool, right? All of the mecha action is intense and awesome, right? Yes. Yes it is. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not much of a mech fan, never have been, but the sci-fi backdrop and fast-paced mecha action had me watching at full attention even when I was bone-tired. The action is the heart and soul of Gunbuster, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s by far where it shines the brightest. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also the part of the show that should, by all means, have least amount of explanation possible poured into it. Unfortunately, Gainax didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get this memo. See, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good reason science fiction isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t supposed to be rooted in science fact\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It would be too freaking boring if it made sense. Using Star Wars for an example, nobody cares how a ship can slow down in outer space\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 What we do care about is who our heroes are, why they are the way they are, and where their journey is going to take them.\n\nGunbuster does the exact opposite of this, by developing the science and technology of this world, and giving everything else minimum effort. Between each episode in the DVD box set are mini episodes where chibis of Noriko and Kazumi dump exposition that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full of big words but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean a single damn thing. It keeps going on and on from there, sounding progressively regressive in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sanity until it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s finally suggested to us that Space Travel can be greatly improved by harnessing the power of ESPers and dolphins wearing space helmets. No, I am not making up a word about that, but here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the strange thing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 These details were so incomprehensible from the beginning that nobody really complains. Viewers before then had already given up trying to make sense out of ANY of the things Gunbuster has to say about it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own universe, so why not dolphins?\n\nThese spurts of insanity could be used as a running gag, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the kind of sense of humor Gunbuster had. Remember how there was a lot of training in the first episode that had nothing to do with space battles? Push-ups and running laps in giant mech suits, marching up and down huge flights of stairs in lead sandals? That was intentional. That was Gainax\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099s honest attempt at a joke. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s its sense of humor in a nutshell. Didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t laugh? Me neither.\n\nEven the villains are described half-assedly, as attacking the human race because our existence is meaningless to the universe. Not a threat, mind you, but just meaningless. I really hope that was just a character describing his own theory, because there is no way Gainax would be stupid enough to make that canon\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And yet there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no disproving it. Oh, and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t point to that one \u00e2\u0080\u0098military secret,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 because we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prove that predates the attacks. So yeah, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just innocent victims, here. Guess what? Villains without understandable motives are boring. At least Starship Troopers offered up the possibility that the bugs were provoked.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m no physicist, but from what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard, the only part of it Gunbuster gets right is the time disparity between those traveling at lightspeed and those on Earth, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a plot device used a few times, especially in the final two add-on episodes. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an interesting idea to say the least, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s used well at first, up until the final two episodes, where it breaks down into an excuse to explore new futures without having to age the how young protagonist. The new futures, by the way, bring abrupt, out of nowhere developments like\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Kazuki being in love with their Coach! Her and Noriko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s robots can combine! Yeah, I hate to say it, but the final two episodes don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even really need to be there. At the end of episode four, a charming little blurb tells us that while two final episodes have been confirmed, the only things they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d come up with were the two titles. And the story was largely over at that point, so moving forward, the only way to really round out two new episodes was to repeat the plot two more times\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 With minor, spoiler differences.\n\nIn a way, you can kind of tell that Gunbuster was created by a group of otakus just barely starting to find themselves as story-tellers. They even made their main character identify as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cUltimate Otaku,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a designation that amounts to a few posters on her wall and the visual of her calling out the names of her attacks, presumably because it was the only way to make her feel relatable to them. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to come down too hard on it, as it was only their second project, and their first financial success, and they DID expand a lot of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ideas several years later with Evangelion. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very amateurish piece of work, which makes sense, because they were amateurs at the time. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very important title in their history, so I still highly recommend you check it out.\n\nGunbuster was originally available stateside by Image Entertainment, with a very boxy DVD set that was released in 2007. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s since gone out of print, but you can still find it floating around online for about fifty bucks, unless you get really lucky like I did. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s set for a re-release in May by the company Maiden Japan, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be releasing it in movie format. Yes, they somehow trimmed the three hour series into a 95 minute movie, and no, I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen it, so I have no idea how well it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll hold up. A sequel series is also available on DVD, but since I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen Diebuster myself, I have no idea what it is or how it ties into the series. The manga by Kadocha is not available stateside.\n\nEarlier in this review, I said Gunbuster wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very good, and I stand by that assessment. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a die hard fan of it, I apologize, but I only saw it recently, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the benefit of nostalgia goggles. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bad show, of course\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Honestly, I enjoyed it. If you can ignore how bare bones the writing is, it has a very simple story, and while the characters are closer to constructs than people, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still likeable. The final two episodes, while a little pointless, are more of exactly what this series delivers on the hardest\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Great action and decent animation. Unfortunately, the animation is one of the only things about it that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel dated, and even with that issue removed, it tends to feel a bit mediocre. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still an okay series, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s engaging enough to keep me awake where other shows wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Not only would I recommend it to people, hell, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d watch it again. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of Gainax\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best shows, even if that honor is slowly becoming more dubious. I give Gunbuster a 6/10. "}, {"id": 3227, "score": 56, "body": "What was I expecting when I started watching Inu x Boku SS? I really don't know, something entertaining at the very least? Unfortunately, Inu x Boku  is nothing of the sort, just an episodic hodgepodge of random scenarios with little-to-no overarching plot. I'm actually not sure what this was supposed to be. A romance? If so, it certainly lacked progression until the _very_ end. A comedy? Well, it didn't really make me laugh very much, which I admit, is somewhat subjective, but the humor didn't work for me, outside of a few characters or episodes. Supernatural? I guess it had supernatural elements. Honestly, those were the highlight of the show, but the supernatural powers got so little focus that they may as well have been just a plot device.\n\nArtistically, Inu x Boku is going to blow absolutely nobody away. It's rather basic in every way and is starting to look a little dated as the years pass. That's not to say it's not acceptable, but it may look really old in a few years. The big win for Inu x Boku was the songs. I really liked the opening and the changing endings, it added an air of personality to each episode, which was refreshing. Outside of those things, nothing about Inu x Boku is a technical marvel, it's only acceptable at best.\n\n__Favorite Character:__ Kagerou Shoukiin\n~~~img(https://i2.wp.com/angryanimebitches.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Inu-x-Boku-SS-Ep-5-Img0016.png?ssl=1)~~~\nI was a hair away from saying that Karuta was my favorite, but I had to give it to my S&M dude. Honestly, his introductory episode was the funniest in the entire series, I was legit laughing out loud because of his antics. I aspire to go around labeling things as sadistic or masochistic now because of him.\n\nTo be clear, I did like some of the cast, even if it's not as many of them as I would have liked. Sorinozuka, or the scroll dude, was really funny as well, especially with his interactions with Nobara, his perverted, lesbian secret service agent. Nobara in general was a hilarious character. However, I cannot say that I loved the main two characters very much. They kind of felt as if someone was like, \"Hey, we have these two pieces of cardboard for main characters, so let's give them a personality.\" and then they decided to make one piece of cardboard a self-pitying loli tsundere and the other an overly attached stalker. I felt zero connection to either of them throughout the entire series. Not once did I feel anything other than boredom when they came onto the screen. If you've followed my reviewing at all, you know I'm a huge shipper and this show didn't even make me bother with shipping characters, because they were so mediocre outside of a select few.\n\nI don't even know if I'm disappointed by Inu x Boku or just relieved to be done with it. To make a confession, I was kind of half asleep for the last 3-4 episodes, if not even longer, so I may have missed out on the best the show had to offer. However, I feel as if that proves my point though. Inu x Boku couldn't even command enough of my attention for a single cour, _that's_ how bland it is."}, {"id": 3230, "score": 50, "body": "Satsuki Miyanoshita has just moved with her father and little brother to a new town in order to deal with the death of her beloved mother. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very strong little girl who has taken over many of her mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chores and provides endless emotional support for her much more frail little brother, Keiichiro. On her first day at her new school, she catches Keiichiro trying to sneak their cat into class with him. Little Kaya bolts from them, leading them all the way to the campus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abandoned old school house, where they, two of her classmates, and an older girl looking for her hat get locked in together.\n\nIn their struggle to escape the haunted halls of this eerie Elementary School, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re attacked by several spirits, including an angry rampaging demon named Omanujaku. But before he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s able to lay a satanic smackdown on them, Satsuki finds an old notebook that was written by her deceased mother, and it tells her how to bind Omanujaku\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spirit for good\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Inside of their cat! Thus their new school life begins with a possessed talking cat, a menagerie of monsters who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve just had their resting place disturbed, and a notebook that mysteriously ties their late mother to the recently released spirits that are now haunting the town. Can Satsuki, Keiichiro and their new friends finish what her mother started\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Or will they be joining her sooner than they think?\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already spoken in detail about Studio Pierrot back in my Twelve Kingdoms review, so I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bore you with those details again\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I did mention that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done some impressive looking work, but sadly, Ghost Stories is not one of them. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the most poorly animated show I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s by far one of the cheapest. This is more evident in the characters than it is in the often impressive backgrounds, but the date it came out is showcased in painfully blatant ways. The dawn of the new millennium was an awkward time for a lot of animation studios, and Pierrot is no exception.\n\nMovement in this series is minimal, and what movement it does feature is often stiff and jumpy. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say it never impresses, because there are several moments that clearly had more money poured into them than others, and a lot of those moments involve the ghosts and demons that keep coming back for each episode. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest enemy by far is the pause button. The characters aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very well drawn, and there are far too many moments that a single freeze-frame will result in an image that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s far below what you might call professional standards. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not as noticeable when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re moving, but the derpy faces, weird outlines, constant still frames, and awkward jerky movements make Ghost Stories look less like an actual anime and more like a cheap bootleg of said anime.\n\nThe music is better, to be sure, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still about average fair for this kind of series. It does it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job well, hitting whatever notes it needs to between standard slice of life whimsy, creepy strings underlying tension and suspense, and big dramatic stings for the bigger payoffs. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty good in general, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing about it that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really standout or memorable. Which is kind of the point, anyway. The opening is a lot more fun, and while I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t insist upon watching it all the way through every time, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plagued by the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s animation woes, Grow Up is still a pretty damn catchy song by Hysteric Blue, and the video at least manages to keep pace with it. The ending theme, on the other hand\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not bad, and it fits the show tonally, I still find it really odd that a song called Sexy Sexy would be attached to a show who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cast is dominated by elementary school children.\n\nSo, when this show was airing in Japan, it was released to an underwhelming, mediocre reception. In short, it was a huge flop, to the point that they weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even able to go 26 episodes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They had to cut off early, officially ending the series with episode 20. They lost so much money on it than when ADV Films showed an interest in dubbing it for the states\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Because, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face it, ADV in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prime would dub pretty much anything\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Aniplex gave them a simple mandate; Do whatever the hell you want with it. They gave ADV complete creative control, with the only limits being that they couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change the character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s names too much and the ghost\u00e2\u0080\u0099s backstories(Most of which were tied directly to Japanese mythology) had to remain intact. They had already given up on making a profit off of this series, and wanted nothing more than to minimize the damage it had caused to them, and they had hopes that a popular American release could help to recoup their losses.\n\nADV handed this project to Steven Foster, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recently become notorious for his awful writing and complete lack of respect for a lot of the material he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been given. In particular, the rampant backlash that emerged from his nigh-unlistenable Clannad dub has followed him like an angry spirit all the way to his sour grape flavored exit from the dub directing business. While he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always had a penchant for writing characters unfaithfully and making them as hateful and offensive as possible, with no understanding whatsoever about how real humans talk to each other, and that certainly sounds like a description of the Ghost stories dub\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 You really can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t blame him for this one. He may have laid down a few guidelines, but for the most part, he told the actors in his cast to ad-lib their lines and make it as funny and offensive as possible. How\u00e2\u0080\u0099d they do?\n\nWell, as this is intended to be a comedic dub, I guess I should judge it from that perspective. There are generally three categories that the humor in this show falls into. The first category is called Pop Culture References. There are tons of them in this dub, and the names they drop range from high profile Hollywood celebrities to political figures to\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, even the voice actors themselves, in some cases. Unfortunately, very few of these references are actually funny, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pretty much thrown out at random without any regard for whether or not it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s called for or makes any sense. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of like watching a version of Family Guy, except that instead of using the references to set up cut-away gags, the references just sort of linger there, leaving the viewer to wonder what the point of them was. They can also be incredibly dated, as they throw out several references to Christian Slater\u00e2\u0080\u0099s career being dead, and they even make a joke about Supermarket Sweep at one point\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Which was a dated reference even then!\n\nThe second category is the offensive humor, and no, nothing is sacred here. Every race is insulted in some way throughout the twenty episode run, and every religion takes just as hard a shot. Racial stereotypes are the norm here, and to make matters worse, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the same tired stereotypes you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard before. Black people are violent rapists, Latinos are lazy, Asian people all look the same\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like they all took a class called \u00e2\u0080\u009cIntro to racism\u00e2\u0080\u009d before going to work. And yeah, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s oddly nonsensical for this cast of Asian characters to insult the Asian race, but you could say it was done for the sake of irony\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 If it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for the fact that an anti-Asian joke also appeared in Foster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s High School of the Dead dub, and also for the fact that white people are troublingly untouched in this series, celebrity references aside. Homosexuality is also viciously mocked, and while the racism and homophobia wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be as much of a problem if it was funny\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not, it just sounds forced, on a note of \u00e2\u0080\u0098let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s see what we can get away with!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe final category is bit more difficult to define, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basically all of the plot and character relevant material, and thank God, this part of the show is much more funny than the other two categories. Most of the characters were rewritten for this dub, and the interactions between them and their retooled personalities are where the most effective humor is truly derived. The strong and supportive Satuski has been turned into a spunky, manipulative girl who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obsessed with her physical appearance and constantly mocks her younger brother, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been transformed into a mentally challenged mush-mouth. Hajime has been transformed into a smart-ass ladies man, his best friend Leo has been turned into a penny-pinching Jewish boy with an inferiority complex, and Momoko\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The psychic of the group who was only there to look pretty and occasionally channel the soul of Satsuki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Has been transformed into a bible-thumping extremist christian. The dynamic that these characters have, and the jokes that flow between them, are what really makes this dub as hilarious as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been hyped up to be.\n\nSo if the humor in this show is only funny about a third of the time, then why am I recommending it over the sub? Because the acting is fan-freaking-tastic. You can say whatever you want about Steven Foster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s writing abilities\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And you totally should, because he deserves every word of criticism he gets\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But when it comes to casting, the man was a genius. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always had a talented pool of actors working under him, and even in his most poorly written projects, you could always count on the dub being, at the very least, well acted. The voice actors attached to this show were clearly refreshed and inspired by the rare opportunity to go nuts and make up their own dialogue, because the energy and enthusiasm that went into their performances is astounding.\n\nThe main cast is great, but of course they are\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 When you have a cast consisting of Hilary Haag, Monica Rial, Greg Ayres, Chris Patton, and Christine Auten, OF COURSE you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have a great sounding dub. Throw in professional comedian Rob Mungle, and it becomes painfully obvious how Aniplex was able to make their money back. All six of these people, on their own, are used to being the stars of their dubs, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all together here. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just them, every single supporting actor that shows up, no matter, how much screen time they get, is just as good\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 With the exception of Blake Shepherd, of course, but his role is so blissfully ironic that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more than excusable.\n\nEven in a dub that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s universally well-acted, I still have to give special props to possible human Mimic Brittney Karbowski, who brings a quiet animal-loving girl from Satsuki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s class and turns her into a creepy weirdo with bizarre, terrifying mood swings. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve raved about her before, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to see why she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s currently one of the most in-demand voice actresses. Oh, and before move on, one more note about the dub\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really weird about it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of foul language. In the first few volumes, there was barely any F-bombs or S-bombs, and they relied on silly phrases like \u00e2\u0080\u009cfizzity-uck\u00e2\u0080\u009d instead. Then they spent a few volumes bleep-swearing, before finally moving on to actual cursing in the final volume. I mean, the change-over literally took place in the space of a single episode, which contained a censored shit and an uncensored fuck. Which is really weird. Either way, fizzity-uck is now one of my favorite words.\n\nNow, you may be wondering\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Why did I spend so much time talking about the dub? Well, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because the dub is really the only interesting thing about this series. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not exaggerating, either. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good reason this show was such a huge disappointment for the company that put it out, and if it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for the English dub, it probably would have been forgotten by everyone within a year of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s final episode. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen plenty of \u00e2\u0080\u0098monster/ghost of the week\u00e2\u0080\u0099 type anime, and with the dub turned off, this is by far the most generic, uninspired one I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come across yet. The characters have little to no personality and absolutely no development, aside from the abrupt development that Omanujaku goes through towards the end. Every episode follows the same pacing and structure, even in the case of the episodes that DON\u00e2\u0080\u0099T involve the old school house.\n\nDoes that mean it was awful? No\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 At least, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think so. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coherent, consistent, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the worst waste of time if you like the genre. But even then, it really doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do anything that more successful titles haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t done a lot better. you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have to be really patient with it in order to not consider it boring, which would be fine if it was deep or profound enough to deserve that patience. Sadly, it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. And it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even really make a good children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s show, what with the occasional blood and frequent panty shots that it features\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 At least not for American children.\n\nGhost Stories was originally available from ADV Films, who were releasing it on individual four-episode DVDs, but following it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crash a few years ago, the title was picked up by Discotek media, who released it on a much cheaper thin-pack format. You can find it on their website for 34.95, or on amazon.com for just 29.99. You can also watch the entire series for free on youtube, but then again, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no telling when a sudden copyright claim will result in it being taken down. The original novels by Toru Tsunemitsu are not available stateside.\n\nGhost Stories has a really strange production history, which is mostly due to some very unique circumstances that have never happened before and will probably never happen again. An all-around underachiever in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original context, the only really interesting thing about it is it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s English dub, which is the only reason that it still retains any hint of relevancy in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market. Unfortunately, that dub is remarkably immature, sporting the lowest of the lowbrow, and while it may be worth a few good chuckles now and then, it can only truly win the hearts of that lowest-common-denominator fanbase that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been keeping Family Guy alive since it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s season 4 revival. Yes, I know it was almost entirely ad-libbed, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a certain novelty to hearing our favorite voice actors cut loose and leave it all on the table, but the end result is hit-or-miss at best. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t usually take the English dub into account when deciding on a final score for a review, but in this case, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I really have a choice in the matter. I give Ghost Stories a 5/10.  "}, {"id": 3239, "score": 60, "body": "It seems that love can come from the strangest places. Even on a version of Earth where technology has advanced to the point where alien integration has become commonplace, the phrase \u00e2\u0080\u009cStrange places\u00e2\u0080\u009d should still not be taken lightly. This is how it was for Kazuto, the owner of his family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s struggling bathhouse, who was minding his own business one day, both literally and figuratively, when calamity struck. A spaceship, driven by a runaway bride from another planet, crash-landed through his roof, killing him. The pilot, Princess Valkyrie of the Valhalla royal family, was stricken with grief by what she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d done, so she offered half of her soul to bring him back to life. This simple act of kindness brought new life to the young man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart, in more ways than one. The loss of half of her soul may have turned Valkyrie into a child, but the bond between them still continued to grow, to the point where the two of them became very much in love\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And it was a love strong enough to overcome every obstacle the scorned Royal Family could throw at them.\n\nHaving put what they thought was the worst of it behind them, Kazuto and Valkyrie have settled back down into their relatively normal everyday lives, running the bathhouse, dealing with all sorts of alien nonsense, and generally stagnating in a passionless, vaguely defined relationship. Whatever floats their boat, I guess. But strange things have been happening around them, beginning with the appearance of The Key of time, a weapon tied directly to the dark history of Valhalla, followed up by the appearance of Chorus, the weirdest member of the Royal family, and most importantly by the appearance of Valkyrie Ghost, a mysterious black-clad woman who bears a striking resemblance to Kazuto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s child bride. Calling him her \u00e2\u0080\u009cPhantom Lover,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Valkyrie Ghost seemingly intends to separate Valkyrie and Kazuto from the life they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve settled into, but for what purpose? What does she want with the Key of Time? How much does Chorus know about her? As it turns out, these elements and more share a surprising connection in the continued adventures of Valkyrie and friends!\n\nYes, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re revisiting UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie again, which of course means we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re revisiting it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s animation studio, Media Factory Inc, who shared it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s duties with a smaller studio, TNK, who also collaborated with them on High School DXD, but managed such lovely projects as School Days by themselves. The animation was abysmal in the first season, and while I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say the budget has improved since then, the direction definitely has. The first season was directed by Shigeru Ueda, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s had a ton of backstage experience, but has only acted as the main director on a handful of titles, including Rin: Daughters of Mnemosyne, the swimsuit OVA from Senran Kagura, and the final two episodes of Key the Metal Idol, one of which you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll remember I called virtually unwatchable. Ironically, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find any information on second season director Nobuhiro Takagi outside of a handful of single to dual episode storyboard jobs, and yet he was handed the director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job in Valkyrie 2, and he did a much better job with it than Ueda did.\n\nKeep in mind, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not saying the series looks good. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably a bridge too far. It does show vast improvement compared to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s predecessor, but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really feel like a hard thing to accomplish. Takagi employed a lot of money saving techniques, the majority of which are immediately apparent to even the greenest of anime viewers. He limits unnecessary movements through clever framing, he spent nearly an entire episode on characters standing on stage and singing while the camera panned up a still shot of them while only their mouths move, and while there may have been one magical girl transformation scene per episode in season 1, they can happen multiple times an episode in season 2\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Especially because there are at least four different transformation sequences, and I kid you not, one of them\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Introduced in episode 9\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Is used almost half a dozen times in that one episode. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s annoying to see these sequences over and over again, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transparent as all hell, but it does a great job at saving money, so the rest of the series doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to look like ass.\n\nAnimation is still stilted, there are of course a lot of lengthy key frames, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll even admit that there are several uses of one of my least favorite budget saving tactics, bouncing the top half of a character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body up and down to convey that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re walking, but it does save enough money for the series to feature movement whenever it needs to, especially during the action scenes. Remember, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a villain this season, and while the fight scenes she gets involved in are passable at best, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still far better than anyone could have expected material from this franchise to look. More impressive still is the art direction, which, unlike the animation, is more than just relatively good, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually, genuinely good. No more inconsistent anatomies, no more faces going off model, everyone looks fine, the lighting is well thought out, and the backgrounds\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Particularly when they leave the normal world to travel to alternate dimensions and eventually outer space\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Are gorgeous, and often capture the exact moods they feel like they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supposed to.\n\nWhat helps the mood of the series even more is the music, which is another noteworthy improvement over season 1. While that season was mostly silly, weird and melodramatic, Season 2 dives into a much deeper well of emotions, including fear, sadness, loneliness and actual romance, among others. In order to convey this, the orchestration takes a much more epic tone, although you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know it from the opening. I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a fan of the first season opening, but the new one is just generic and boring. The song is okay, Meguriai by Melocure, but the video just feels like a dull slog trying to get itself over with. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about eleven seconds of it panning sideways on a still image of a bathhouse changing room, and of course, every relevant character gets their profile shot. These problems are thankfully made up for by the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s insert song, Princess of December, a beautifully written song that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performed just as well by Megumi Ogata, and it does more than just stop hearts\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the many elements of the series that foreshadows the larger plot that culminates in the later episodes.\n\nThe English dub has also stepped up, but if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m being honest, the biggest influence on this change isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a change in voice direction or acting, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the quality of the characters, and the way this specific move has changed what was expected of the actors. The exception to this is sadly Greg Ayres, who still feels wasted in the boring, milquetoast role of Kazuto, perhaps the least interesting main character in anime history, but the change in writing has been a godsend for Kira Vincent Davis, who plays three different versions of the female lead, Valkyrie. She plays the child version of Valkyrie with the same voice as before, but the character herself is way less annoying, and almost never makes any creepy pedophilic innuendoes, a welcome change. Valkyrie herself shows up a little more often, and is given a better array of situations to act on, rather than just being a love-struck Captain Planet like before. The addition of Valkyrie Ghost, however, is what truly allows her undeniable talent to shine, as the dynamic between Valkyrie and her sinister doppleganger adds layers of complexity to both performances.\n\nThe list of characters who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve improved for the benefit of their actors is expansive. Miss Sanada is still obsessed with Valkyrie, but to nowhere as creepy or cruel a degree, giving Christine Auten reason to play her more likably, with a bit more care and purpose in her voice. Akina spends the majority of her dialogue in ways that are related to the plot and her relationship with Hydra, so she no longer has to play the thirsty forlorn bitch, which was clearly refreshing for her. Rika\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not as uptight or miserly as she used to be, making even Monica Rial\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weird choice of delivery a lot easier to listen to. Nancy Novotny is still the perfect actor for Hydra, writing changes be damned, and thankfully for Hillary Haag, the character of Laine gets a lot more depth this season, especially with the addition of Kimberly Prause, who plays her estranged high school chum Chorus as weird and dorky, yet oddly serious, even when dropping ridiculous anime references. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also worth mentioning that the adaptive writer Kyle Jones took a loose approach to the dialogue, but unlike certain other ADV names, his changes were mostly for the better, and they only really stuck out a few times, like a strange Tyra Banks reference that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more dated than anything. Over-all, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pretty solid dub.\n\nIf you remember my review of the first season of this series, you may remember me having a less than favorable opinion of it. In no unclear terms, I called it the pedophilic rip-off of Ah! My Goddess, an assertion that I still stand by. Well, okay, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t JUST that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It was, at the most basic level, a fanservice show that failed miserably at both having fans and providing them service. To put it bluntly, people who watch anime for fanservice don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the highest of standards. Give them boobs and sexual situations, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll put up with lazy art, terrible animation, horrible implications and God knows what else just to have another anime in their spank bank. UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie, despite taking place at a bathhouse and thus having what should have been unlimited access to exposed skin, was a complete flop. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how bad this series was at fanservice, whatever their problem with it was. There are good ways and bad ways to deliver fanservice, and while it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surprisingly complicated, Valkyrie was distinctly part of the latter.\n\nIn order to fix this problem, director Nobuhiro Takagi apparently made the unorthodox decision to scale back the fanservice, a decision that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not always the best idea. There are many anime that needed that kind of content as a crutch, and wound up suffering without it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Love Hina and Negima! come to mind\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But there are also some that would be better off with less skin and panties, like Valkyrie Drive Mermaid and Strike Witches. The second season of Valkyrie, subtitled December Nocturne, falls right into the latter category. Aside from a handful of recycled and weirdly framed bathhouse scenes in the first two episodes, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost no fanservice throughout the rest of the series. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no panty shots to speak of outside of one of the new transformation sequences(which is otherwise entirely clothed), the pedophilia has been wittled down to one admittedly painful child abduction gag, and while there are scenes taking place in the bathhouse, they rarely feel exploitative beyond their involvement in the plot.\n\nUnfortunately, the premise of the series hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t changed. Everything still revolves around Kazuto and Valkyrie, and when you get right down to it, they barely have the basic qualifications to be considered characters. Every character around them is more interesting than they are. The relationship they have is still completely uneventful, boring and passionless, and yet we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supposed to be afraid that they might get broken up. They never express their feelings for each other through actions or gestures, and while I get that you can partially blame that on one of them spending most of her time as a child, the farthest they go when she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an adult is looking longingly into each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes, and that happens like twice this season. Even if their situation never changes, and Valkyrie never goes back to being an adult full time, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supposed to want it to happen, so that *I* have a reason to want it to happen. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been two seasons, and they both seem content with having a love they can never physically express, and while I guess there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some chaste virtue to that, they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even struggle with it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a non-issue. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a huge problem, and it makes up the core of the series.\n\nHaving said that, December Nocturne has two huge advantages over the first season. The first is the character of Chorus, who is introduced in episode 2 and adds a brand new dimension of comedy to the franchise. Her introductory episode tells you everything you need to know about her, as she pretends to be a dying robot, and damn does she commit to this act, driving the main cast to desperate action only to casually move onto her next act after supposedly dying in front of them. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a unique character who lives in her own world and follows her own logic, with little regard for anyone else, appealing to both otakus and people on the autism spectrum(I can attest to both) in genuine ways that I rarely ever see. One of boring old Valkyrie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best moments is when she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trying in vain to save Chorus, and if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not amazing enough, she actually winds up making the previously annoying Laine likeable, too. They even get their own backstory episode taking place in school, although that episode DOES feature homophobic overtones that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up anywhere else. Seriously, explain to me how Laine used to have a massive crush on Valkyrie, but now only has eyes for Kazuto.\n\nThe other advantage is the plot. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not just saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good because it has a plot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I mean it has a GOOD plot, and one that it actually takes seriously. To be clear, this is not a deep series, nor is it original or smart. Where it shines is in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sincerity and execution. There is no ulterior motive to the writing. It isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trying to arouse the viewer, or waste as much time as possible on filler, or pretending to be more mature than it is. Good writing and execution can make even the shallowest of material engaging, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly what December Nocturne does. Every single episode, regardless of how stupid or cliched it may look at the start, winds up doing something relevant to the plot, and even aside from that, each episode winds up doing something engaging and thoughtful. The budget saving episode where everyone enters a karaoke contest, for example, seems at the beginning like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be simple and straightforward. You see most of the cast sing, there are sub-plots floating around about the prizes, there are good laughs to be had, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an okay episode by harem standards.\n\nBut then, in one of the best and most emotionally provocative moments in the series, Valkyrie ghost shows up at the end, not only making you feel genuinely sorry for Val, but establishing an important detail about the relationship between the two of them and the Phantom Lover. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a hot springs episode, which is common in most anime and absurdly common in this particular genre, and while it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty sterile in terms of nudity, you spend most of the episode with the cast lost on a snowy mountain, with the music and art direction establishing a tone that tricks you into thinking any one of them could die at any moment\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Especially when, once again, Valkyrie ghost enters the equation. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an episode where the main cast gets turned into children, which is normally the worst idea any harem anime can pursue, but aside from the aforementioned child abduction scene(which was legitimately despicable), but we also get a beautiful story of one of the less-represented princesses getting to explore a romance and rediscover her youth. Akina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s love for Kazuto got down-played this season, but when we learn about a special power she and Hydra have, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re given a somber look into the feelings she still has for him.\n\nAnd then we have the ultimate plot, which is revealed towards the end of the series. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great idea, and it gets pulled off with a lot of heart and emotion, falling back on set-ups and call-backs that you probably never thought would again be relevant, but\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 How can I say this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It uses the wrong kind of foreshadowing. It does an okay job as is, and you can tell that they had everything planned from the start, and it all builds up to a satisfying pay-off, but if there are huge secrets underneath the surface of Valhalla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history, then THAT is the material that needs to be established. They needed to drop hints about the Royal Family not being what they seem, and even if they did turn out to be completely innocent, the characters need to have some form of doubt so that we, as the audience, can feel it just the same. I love Valkyrie ghost, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of my favorite anime villains, but I needed more than her to keep me guessing. Things should have been happening from multiple angles to keep the characters guessing, and I really feel that a tighter focus on the mystery from these angles could have helped the series to reach the level of sophistication that they skirted so close to. It might be one of the biggest seasonal improvements I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen, but it could have been so much more.\n\nUFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie 2: A December nocturne was originally available from ADV Films, before being rescued and redistributed by Section23. Like the first season, it was initially released stateside in 30 dollar 4-episode DVDs, but have become much more affordable overtime. The ADV Thinpack release, for example, can be found for as little as four dollars, depending on your timing. A two-pack featuring both seasons 1 and 2 can be found relatively cheap online, but it unfortunately wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t picked up by Funimation like seasons 3 and 4 were, so your success level may vary. You can, however, watch the entire series on Amazon video. The original manga by Kaishaku has not been released stateside.\n\nI haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen a sequel put this much effort into fixing the problems of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s predecessor since Cinderella 3. does it have problems? Of course it does, look at the franchise it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in. It was meant to have problems. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why the quality of the series tanked right back down to insufferable levels in season 3. But this season was different, as it had a director that tried, and put extra effort into making something awful into something watchable. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not saying it was great, nor do I think it would have been fair to expect greatness from it, but I was honestly surprised at just how good it managed to be. It was bogged down by a few unavoidable details, such as the idiotic premise and the bare bones budget, and it still wound up being really stupid on the whole, but by adding a well-thought-out comedic character and an awesome villain that presented a legitimate threat and a sympathetic backstory that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take anything away from said threat, and by committing to writing even the most hare-brained situations with heart and substance, December nocturne was a lot of fun, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a series that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend even to people who haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen the first season. I give UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie 2: A December Nocturne a 6/10.  "}, {"id": 3248, "score": 50, "body": "Ever since mankind perfected the art of starting fires, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been at the top of the food chain. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve used weapons to make up for our lack of claws, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve built houses to make up for our lack of immunity to the elements. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve invented food processing, as well as other techniques to ensure that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not pumping our bodies full of disease and parasites, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve even invented supermarkets so we could stop hunting and sit on our asses all day while marathoning Breaking Bad. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve held dominion over the rest of God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s creatures for so long that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never really had to worry about another species knocking us off of our seat at the throne.\n\nWhile the practice of humans killing humans is about as common as the practice of making more humans to replace them, we never expected a threat to our population to evolve right from our own ranks\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Until the Diclonius arose. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the new breed of human, characterized by a pair of bony horns on their head, a set of invisible arms growing out of their back, and no genitalia (which must have been a huge relief to the people in charge of censoring the show). While the way they breed remains a mystery, their mission in life is simple\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Wipe out the human race, and then repopulate the earth. And their queen bee just escaped out into the public.\n\nNow, that queen bee\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Lucy\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 is on the run, ready to gruesomely murder any pitiful human who gets in her way. How will she deal with having to live with the one person she can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t kill?\n\nElfen Lied was produced and released by Studio Arms, an animation company that makes it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entire living off of crap. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not kidding. Their library consists mainly of pornos, loathsome battle vixen shows, and obscure OVAs that nobody cares about. Their most ambitious projects aside from Elfen Lied are Genshiken, which I admit I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen, and last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incompetent snoozefest, Mao Yu. This is not a company you want as your alma mater, and visually, Elfen Lied is no exception.  Well, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not completely fair\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 To it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s credit, the background artwork is actually really good, beautiful stuff. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s highly detailed, perfectly lit, and shaded with nothing short of a master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s touch. The character designs, on the other hand, aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t nearly as easy to look at. They look fairly normal in most shots, with nothing really special or noteworthy. Then there are the facial expressions that look like they were designed by the troll face guy, and far off shots where everything looks distorted and off model.\n\nThe animation is also some of the worst I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen, at least when you actually see it. You spend most of the series staring at key frames that feature barely any movement outside of the lip flaps. The very few full-shot walk cycles that you get to see are embarrassingly bad, as the characters in them barely seem to exist in the same universe as the backgrounds they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re running against. I said earlier that the backgrounds look really beautiful, but even when you clearly hear the presence of strong wind, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never see a single leaf moving. That is, except that there will occasionally be a shot of cherry blossom petals falling down, and this appears a lot in the outdoor scenes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It looks fluid and graceful in motion, at least until you realize that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just playing the same bit of animation over and over again\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Even in the freaking rain! The animation does clean up and present itself in a few select fight scenes, but they still look mediocre by any other show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s standards. For the most part, a huge chunk of the budget was clearly wasted on the goofy looking CG arms that all the Diclonius\u00e2\u0080\u00a6es\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 have.\n\nThe characters look like garbage, which is fitting, because most of them ARE garbage. Lucy herself is a really good, complex character, but after suffering a concussion during her escape from the research facility, she develops a split personality. That other side of herself, who emerges whenever she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hit on the head or has a bad memory, is called Nyu, and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, to avoid using an offensive and highly volatile term, Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just say she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essentially a walking infant with boobs, which she will happily squeeze into someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand at the slightest provocation. She pees all over the floor, and can only say her name(Yes, like a pokemon). If a character with her personality was included in an American TV show, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be banned from the network faster than you can say Derpy Hooves. In short, Nyuu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existence does to Lucy what Jar Jar Binks did to the original Star Wars trilogy.\n\nAnd the couple that takes her in? Kohta and Yuka, both of whom are first year college students? They are insufferable. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re one of the worst couples in anime history, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not just talking about the fact that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re cousins. I could forgive that. What I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forgive is a will-they-won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t-they dynamic that, for me, was more like will-she-won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t-she-kill them already? Kohta experienced a traumatic event when he was a kid, which resulted in the tragic loss of his personality. Oh, and his family, I think. She hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen him since then, but has somehow stayed in love with him all this time, even turning down her top choice colleges just to go to his. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basically a less interesting version of Shiryou Emiya\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and I so mean that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an obsessed hose beast who takes every possible opportunity to be jealous of the other girls in the house.\n\nThere are a few characters that were good\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Like Bandoh, the sadistic army guy, and Nana, the well behaved Diclonius\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But both of them overstayed their welcome after somehow surviving injuries that should have killed them. Yeah, they somehow survived losing entire limbs, when another character a few episodes later almost bleeds out and dies from one bullet wound. Seeing them come back to life wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother me if their presence beyond that point contributed anything to the plot, which they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. But unlike little orphan Mayu, at least they DO contribute something to the plot at some point.\n\nAs much as it kills me to say this, as a die hard ADV fan, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really recommend this English dub. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a problem with the dialogue, or anything\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The adaptive script is actually quite good\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But as far as the performances go, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a mixed bag. Kira Vincent Davis does an outstanding job playing all three sides of her character\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 She plays Lucy, Nyuu, and the child version of Lucy, even though the original Japanese had a different Saiyuu for each. She plays Lucy as a jaded loner with a serious chip on her shoulder, and you have to give her props for pulling it off without ever sounding emo about it. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little more hope in her squeakier child version of the voice, and more growth as well. Her performance as Nyuu is ungodly annoying, but then again, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an ungodly annoying character, so I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hold it against her.\n\nShe probably performs her best as the child version of Lucy, which might have something to do with the fact that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s playing off of such wonderful actors as Christine Auten, Chris Patton, and Monica Rial. As an adult/woman child, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hanging with a certified C squad that plays our main couple, Kohta and Yuka. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re played by Blake Shepherd, who doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to understand what acting even is, and Nancy Novotny, who doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any talent for it whatsoever. There are some pretty good performances by Jay Hickman, Jason Douglas, and Sasha Paysinger, but in this case, a few bad apples DO spoil the bunch.\n\nThe only time I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend turning the English track on is when little Mariko sets foot\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Er, wheel\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Onscreen. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s played by Her Highness Luci Christian, who I believe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gushed about in the past. I hold her in an extremely high regard, as one of the best emoters in the business, and as somebody who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s able to absolutely own every single role she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presented with. Keep that in mind when I tell you that her role as Mariko is one of her best performances period. She hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t jerked tears this hard since Air. I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spoil the reasons why, but if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a reason to turn on the dub, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s her.\n\nAs for the story itself, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not necessarily a bad one. The plot is one of a kind, is very imaginative, and always manages to take itself seriously without ever becoming preachy or pretentious. The pacing is actually really good as well, as the story never moves slowly enough to start dragging, or too quickly for the viewer to understand what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d necessarily WANT to understand what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on, but good pacing doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always mean good content.\n\nWhere it fails it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hardest is in the execution of the story. There are so many plot holes that I honestly could have made an entire Inconvenient Questions list out of it, if not for the fact that several characters go out of their way to ask about said plot holes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 To no avail, of course, as Elfen Lied would much rather question itself than explain itself. Much like Fate Stay Night, Elfen Lied is a story that spends way too much time on it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main cast playing house and dumping exposition to fully explore it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own exciting concept. In fact, if you really want me to take my gloves off, this is a 13 episode series with so much pointless material in it that it could have easily been told in the space of only six episodes.\n\nAll you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have to do is remove the characters who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t add anything to the plot (Mayu, Bandoh, Arakawa, both of the Kakuzawas), cut the flashbacks down to only the bare essentials, combine Nana and Mariko into one character, and erase all traces of Yuka after she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s filled her role in the first episode. In addition to cutting back on time, having Kohta take more of an active role in the story with only Nyuu/Lucy in the house would have given him a much more complete personality.  As a matter of fact, I would have loved this show a lot more if little Lucy had killed Yuka, instead of just Kohta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father and little sister\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Oops, i\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry, was that a spoiler? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d apologize, but if you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t figure out that little plot twist by the end of episode 1, then there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no hope for you.\n\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot you can say about this show, and not all of it is very nice. What you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say, however, is that it fails as a horror title. As bad as the animation may be, the framing and camera angles are absolutely brilliant, working right alongside the hauntingly beautiful soundtrack and perfect instrumental motif to make the show consistently unsettling and suspenseful, even in the more goofy and ridiculous moments. Right from the start, you have no idea who will live and who will die, and aside from Kohta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never be able to predict what gruesome fates will await these polished, shiny moe models. Whether you love or hate seeing them torn limb from limb, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never feel bored or indifferent about it, which is the reason that it never becomes gratuitous enough to qualify as mindless torture or gore porn.\n\nElfen Lied was once available from ADV Films, in a very beautiful thinpack box set. Following the collapse of ADV, it was picked up and redistributed by Funimation, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve released a few box sets of their own\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not as striking visually, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re cheaper, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty much the only way to get it on Blu-ray. The original manga has never been released in English, and since I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not familiar with the practice of streaming manga, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really know where you can find a translated version. What I can find, however, is a fan-made web comic called Nana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Everyday Life, which concluded several years ago. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually a very interesting read, particular in the latter stages, when they dropped the comedy and went for a more serious, tragic story.\n\nIn conclusion\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 What do you want me to say? Do you want me to call this show the most awesome thing ever, like so many people do? Well, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not true. Do you want me to say that it\u00e2\u0080\u0098s one of the worst pieces of crap I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen, like so many people do? Well, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not true either. My opinion of Elfen Lied is much more in the middle\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too good to be a bad show, but at the same time, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way too bad to be a good show. I really like it, and it will always have a spot on my DVD shelf, but from an objective stand point, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never be able to see it as anything other than average, which is why I wind up giving it an average score\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I give Elfen Lied a 5/10, and a strong recommendation to check it out for yourselves so you can form your own opinion on it."}, {"id": 3275, "score": 50, "body": "-Spoilers\n\nAs a child, Kyousuke Kosaka was really close with his little sister, Kirino. He was her strong, capable brother that she loved and looked up to, and he was more than happy to fulfill that role. He eventually stopped hanging out with her, because he was getting older, and he felt that being that close would be lame. From that point, he became shiftless and lazy, while she began throwing herself into her academic and extracurricular activities. They remained distant for years, until he bumped into her one day, and accidentally discovered her copy of an incest porn video game. She asks him for advice on how to deal with her secret obsession, and from there, the two of them finally begin to repair their strained relationship.\n\nOreimo was originally released in 2010 by AIC Build, a production company that dates back to the early eighties. The art is bright and colorful, the character designs are inspired, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an element of realism that you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect a show like this to possess. The animation is subdued, taking a minimalist approach to the movement of the character. There are still frames, of course, but not very often\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And when the characters move, they move very gracefully. They save the budget for when they really need it, and as a result, the shots of Kirino fangasming over her games are some of the funniest shots this show has to offer.\n\nOh, and the characters have different hairstyles as teenagers than they did as children, so that little tidbit made me happy.\n\nUmm\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Like Kirino, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid I have a confession to make. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve brushed this issue aside in previous reviews, but I think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m finally ready to address it. You see, I have no ear for anime background music. I rarely notice it, unless it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exceptionally out of place or repetitive. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say a lot about the music, but I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any complaints, so it must have at least been passable.\n\nThe title of Oreimo is the shortened version of the actual title, \u00e2\u0080\u0098my little sister can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be this cute.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 With a title like that, and a reputation like this show notoriously has, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to escape the knowledge that this is an incest anime. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve probably heard that before you decided to watch the show, so I really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s any harm in telling you about it now. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a spoiler, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an expectation. And in truth, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always had a kind of spotty relationship with that kind of material. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hate it, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not really offended by it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not something I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m into, or ever will be\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But I do have standards, and in judging this kind of show, I like to use four specific rules. For the sake of context, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be judging this show while at the same time judging two other \u00e2\u0080\u0098Flowers in the Attic\u00e2\u0080\u0099 type shows that I had wildly different opinions on\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Kiss X Sis and Koi Kaze.\n\nRule 1: Take it seriously.\nMy biggest problem with the incest genre is that the vast majority of it seems to exist for the sake of people who use it as escapist jerk-off material. Ironically, like Kirino does. They either have a sibling they wish they could date, wish they had a sibling they could date, or the least disgusting option, they get off on the very idea of forbidden romance. In order to appeal to a wider audience than just the fetish crowd, you have to take the project seriously. It has to be a genuinely good show on more levels than just \u00e2\u0080\u0098wow, this is so hot!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll admit that I dropped Kiss X Sis after only two episodes, because even after two episodes, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see any evidence that this rule would be observed. I could tell that there would be very little that this show was going to offer, other than a \u00e2\u0080\u0098will they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they\u00e2\u0080\u0099 scenario between three characters I was already hating.\nKoi Kaze did a fantastic job of taking itself seriously\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 There weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very many sub-plots aside from the main one, so the entire spotlight was on our two blood-crossed lovers. But since the writing, animation, music and characterizations were so good, they were able to pull the entire series around with them. Thankfully, Oreimo falls mostly into this category. The writing in this show is excellent. The characters are over the top and exaggerated, but still grounded pretty firmly in reality. This makes for some complex decisions, believable dialogue, and just enough melodrama to get the viewer invested wherever it counts. Conflicts are carefully constructed and cleverly resolved at a brisk pace, with each conflict quickly leading towards the next one. This goes a long way towards rule 2\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\nRule 2: Develop the relationship\nIt should go without saying that no romance story in any medium can work unless the focal couple itself works. It has to be believable to be enjoyed by any audience that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just looking for a softcore subtextual porn. In Kiss X Sis, the main thing drawing the main character and his sisters closer together is the fact that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all attractive, and should be attracted to each other. I think. Yeah, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another reason, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll save it for my huge rant in rule 3. In Koi Kaze, the writers took a brilliant approach by having the siblings, who haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen each other in over ten years, not recognize each other. They let their guards down, and bonded, forming an interpersonal attraction before they learned the harsh truth about who the other really was.\nIn Oreimo, the dynamic between Kirino and Kyousuke comes from a very honest place. Kyousuke wants to be the reliable big brother he used to be, which is why he listens to her problems, helps her find friends who are into the same things she is, and sticks up for her whenever necessary. You believe his motives, and every time he goes out of his way to make her happy, you believe her reactions as well. Most of the time, at least. Yes, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a tsundere, but when she shows him gratitude, you can instantly tell how sincere she is about it.\nOf course, they do grow uncomfortably close over time, which leads me to rule 3.\n\nRule 3: Social stigma\nIncestual romance is a subject that a very relatively small percentage of people can actually relate to. See rule 1 for a brief overview of this audience. In order to make your material resonate with a wider audience, you have to include a strong element that they can relate to. And since virtually everyone on earth can relate to the concept of hiding a secret from the world, and being ashamed of something that you just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop indulging in, you absolutely have to deal with the social disapproval that your lovebirds face.\nI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like Kiss X Sis at all, but the reason I dropped it after only two episodes was the way the world seemed to be reacting to the main romance. Everybody in school was either jealous of him for having two hot sisters, or jealous of them for taking their bland dream boat away from them. And their parents? Actually encouraging them to do the nasty? \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour sisters are hot, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not related to them.  What are you, gay?\u00e2\u0080\u009d What world does the mind of this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s creator exist in?\nKoi Kaze did a pretty good job with this, addressing the emotional toll that society\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rules were taking on it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main couple, and using one of Koshiro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coworkers as a pretty damned effective mouth piece for those rules, but regretfully, after they decide to get together in the end, the series just ends, ignoring any long term consequences.\nIn Oreimo, Kyousuke and Kirino don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t face the issue of being a couple until the second season, so I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk about it just yet\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I will say, however, that I had really high hopes for the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s handling of this concept, judging from the way they handled Kirino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obsession with H-Games. There are a few times in the show where her predilections would be discovered by someone close to her, and they would have an instant knee jerk reaction to it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They were disenfranchised by it, and it threw everything they knew about her into question. But no matter how harshly these people react, you can understand how much it hurts them to do so, and with Kyousuke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clever interventions, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re willing to step back and try to understand things from her perspective. These moments are incredibly nuanced, and will probably have you on the edge of your seat.\n\nRule 4: They have to be siblings\nThe siblings in question have to be legitimately blood related. There are many reasons for this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get into some of them in a moment\u00e2\u0080\u00a6  But when you reveal that the pairing is legal through adoption, you effectively kill any sense of drama or stakes that could have made the couple relatable or interesting.  Oreimo thankfully follows this rule, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s guilty of violating one other obvious rule, this time pertaining to the believability of the couple.  According to a real life phenomenon known as The Westermark Effect, children of any gender who are raised together, in constant contact, throughout their formulative years will develop a mental block against each other as romantic options.  They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll become sexually desensitized to each other.  Whether blood is part of the equation or not, it will be virtually impossible for a brother and sister to have any adult tension between them, unless there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an extremely messed up family dynamic in place\u00e2\u0080\u00a6  Like the one presented to us in Nisemonogatari.\nIn Kiss X Sis, the brother is not related by blood to his sisters, who he was raised with, so that show fails at every single rule. In Koi Kaze, They were blood related, and raised apart, which brought some actual realism to the situation.  This is because on the flip side, people are inherently narcissistic(to a degree), and are likely to gravitate towards people who look slightly like them.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s somewhat common for blood related children who were raised apart to become attracted to each other, just like one particularly famous couple in Germany.\nIn Oreimo, I was honestly worried that they were going to pull the adoption card. The first four episodes contained numerous mentions of \u00e2\u0080\u0098you two don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look like brother and sister,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 which I was afraid would be some kind of foreshadowing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 After all, if you choose to use that cowardly cop-out, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not dealing with anything, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just making excuses. But yes, they are related. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use that cop-out, but\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to that later.\nYou eventually get a backstory that explains Kirino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feelings throughout the series, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll actually make you want to root against them as a couple.  And I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t blame you for it.\n\nAside from these rules, the reason Oreimo was able to build such a large following back in 2010 is because it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually about incest\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Or H Games, or Otaku Culture, or any of that esoteric stuff. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because it was about acceptance. Oreimo, at it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core, was about people learning to understand each other despite having every reason to not even bother. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very rare, and very mature message to have for a show that could have been among the lowest of the low brow. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also very rare for any form of media to carry that message without getting too preachy, or defaulting to a lazy, cut-and-paste anti bullying message. It carried through the first season, all the way through the first season OVAs\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 which, by the way, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t skip.\n\nUnfortunately, when the second season came around, this message was gone. The story devolved into a much loser slice-of-life style story, and while the change in production company didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have much of an effect on the animation, the writing took a noticeable turn south. The first few episodes of this season were really good, but it went downhill pretty abruptly in episode 4, when a loli character entered the picture, and dragged it down into the cliched \u00e2\u0080\u0098main girl misunderstands an obvious situation and gets violent\u00e2\u0080\u0099 BS that the show had been so carefully avoiding up until that point. The fanservice count went up, the characters took some bizarre turns, entire episodes seemed pointless\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The writing as a whole wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bad, but it had some really embarrassingly painful moments to it. One of Kirino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s otaku friends, Kuroneko\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 My favorite character of Oreimo\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 goes through some development with Kyousuke, and the dynamic they form is really fun to watch, although her motives are entirely baffling. And one of Kirino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s model friends, who made some awesome Higurashi references in season 1, goes full on Yandere.\n\nWhen I got to the second season OVAs, I had already noticed that this praiseworthy series had significantly dropped in quality, but I still liked it. In fact, I was pretty incredulous about the general consensus towards those OVAs, which everyone seemed to hate. And I was just fine with them, most of the way through. I liked how they were tying off the main plot thread, and I thought Kyousuke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s childhood friend had one of the strongest moments in the series, and I really wanted to see how her encounter would be dealt with\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But then I got to the ending. Let me tell you something about that ending. As much as I enjoyed this show, those last ten minutes of the s2 OVAS was the worst ending I have ever seen for anything in my entire life. I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spoil it, but I was WISHING they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d gone with the adoption cop-out, because the resolution they chose wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just bad, it was insultingly bad. It made absolutely no sense, in context with neither the characters nor the story, and even having finished it and put it behind me, I still feel angry about it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like the last few bites of my ice cream cone were made out of battery acid.\n\nIn 2010, this show was outstanding. It did almost everything right, despite having every excuse in the world to do it all wrong. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know why it took three years and a change of production companies to put out a continuation, but in those three years, something must have gone wrong, either with the original light novels or in the artistic integrity of the people adapting them. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hate the second season, and I could definitely watch them again if the mood ever struck, but my god, that ending throws a very sour sheen onto my thought of this series as a whole.\n\nOh, well\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Breaking down my opinion, this is how my rankings for Oreimo go.\n\nSeason 1: 8/10\nOVAs 1: 8/10\nSeason 2: 5/10\nOVAs 2: 2/10\n\nMy overall score for Oreimo: 5/10\n\nPS:  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m nowhere near the first person to point out those facts about incest IRL\u00e2\u0080\u00a6  In fact, I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have known about them if it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for Jesuotaku and her Koi Kaze review.  Check out her work, you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t regret it!  She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my favorite reviewer for a reason!"}, {"id": 3289, "score": 60, "body": "For as long as mankind has enjoyed the tradition of telling stories, one of the most popular and long-lasting subjects has been the story of the hero\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Average, ordinary people gifted with powers and trusted with the responsibility of fighting for justice, defending those around them, and proving what the average person\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 AKA the reader\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Can accomplish if given the chance. Usagi Tsukino, however, is not what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d call an average or ordinary teenage girl. No, even if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t consider the crushing expectations of Japanese society, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the pinnacle of below-average. Unlike most 14 year old middle school students, Usagi doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have very many hobbies or interests, and even the things she enjoys, like video games, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s below average at. She has no ambitions, she has no real talents, she can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cook, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not athletic, she hates to study, she avoids responsibility at every turn, and no matter how low you set your bar, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the first person you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d expect to be granted the powers of a hero. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably not even your last pick.\n\nHowever, as is often the case, along came a talking cat. Baring a strange crescent moon-shaped bald spot on her forehead, this matronly feline revealed Usagi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true calling to her\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 With destiny at her side, and the mysterious Queen Beryl bringing chaos to her small Japanese town, Usagi was tasked with becoming Sailor Moon, the pretty guardian of love and justice! With only her wits and a few pieces of cosmic weaponry standing between her and defeat, four other Sailor Guardians would soon join her cause. The brilliant Sailor Mercury wields the power of water. The furious Sailor Mars wields the power of fire. The strong Sailor Jupiter wields the power of lightning, and the experienced Sailor Venus, who had been acting on her own as Sailor V long before Usagi obtained her power, wields the power of\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Something. Combined, they form the Sailor Guardians, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up to them to battle and defeat every single threat that Queen Beryl and the Dark Kingdom throw at them in their vague quest to turn the world dark, or something, and they can only do that by finding the missing Moon Princess and returning her to the throne!\n\nAll right, folks, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time once again to visit the nineties, a time when animation standards had to be low enough to accommodate the technology that was available, with very few exceptions managing to break through, but trust me, Sailor Moon wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t one of them. This series, and every single Sailor Moon title that would follow it(as far as I know, at least) was animated by Toei, one of the most long-running and prolific companies in anime history. Their legacy stretches back to the sixties, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had some noteworthy hits such as the One Piece, Captain Harlock and Dragonball franchises, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve actually discussed them before in my review of the 1975 Little Mermaid movie, but one of their biggest names is arguably Sailor Moon, a franchise that began in 1991 and continues to this day in countless variations. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be perfectly honest, here\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I never saw this show during it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allegedly embarrassing run on American TV. I only saw SuperS growing up, and looking back at the OG, yeah, it really doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hold up too well.\n\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say Sailor Moon is one of the worst looking anime I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever watched, but considering the amount I have, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not saying much. People coming into the show blind without a lot of experience with the medium would probably call the animation awful right at first glance, and while that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an understandable reaction, people who are used to watching older anime would more likely be able to tell that for it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time, Sailor moon isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that far below average. The budget was obviously low, even by early nineties standards, but everyone stayed on model, with very rare exceptions. At it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worst, movement can be stilted and static scenes can go on way too long, but honestly, for a magical girl show from 1991, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s competent enough. Freezing characters who aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talking and reusing animation for the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s infamous transformation sequences can also go a long way in conserving animation costs, and this is going to sound really weird\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Even I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fully understand it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But as far as bad animation goes, this one is on the higher end of the scale.\n\nThere are two elements of the artwork that stand out to me the most. The first is the watercolor aesthetic, which\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 for the most part\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 gives the series a very soft and lighthearted feel, and the reason I say \u00e2\u0080\u0098for the most part\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is because that same watercolor art style is surprisingly versatile. This goes for more toned down backgrounds like the interiors of bedrooms and classrooms, where there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enough detail to give the environment life without distracting from the character inhabiting them, but what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even more impressive is just how dark and ominous it can get whenever we enter the realm of the Dark Kingdom, where they use just the right blend of colors to give off a sinister feeling without overdoing it. The other element that stands out is the character designs. Outside of the main cast and a handful of featured extras, the majority of the people on screen look normal enough for the Japanese setting, giving Usagi and the other Sailor Scouts the perfect backdrop to look unique against, with their assorted hair colors and alternate uniforms.\n\nI do have a few gripes with the design conventions, of course\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Since this is an old show, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really get too mad at it for following old cliche trends, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still waiting for someone to explain to me why old people in anime are always portrayed as little people. Do Asian people shrink with age, or something? And of course, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve read my post about Astrid and Other Love Interests, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to tell just by design which of Usagi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two crushes she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll actually wind up with by the end of the first episode. Not that it would have been hard to figure out otherwise. And finally you have the villains, which are every bit as crazy as the Power Rangers episodic baddies, but with the benefit of animation to explore just about every imaginable possibility. Some of them look more ridiculous than others, and I still haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t managed to remove my palm from my face over seeing a priest turn into a boxing monster named Boxxy, but there are more than enough cool and memorable monsters to make up for it, disposable or not.\n\nThe music is a bit generic, but not in a bad way. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the kind of music you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d expect from a show about heroes of justice protecting the innocent, and even the tunes you have to listen to ad nauseum are at least catchy and memorable. Sailor moon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transformation music never wore on my nerves, with it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart-pounding beat calling you to action. The whole orchestration is epic, even if it blends into the action way too well to be noticeable in context. Even the background music that plays in school when there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no real action going on, which would be annoying and repetitive in most anime sounds pretty cool in this show, with a kind of jazz-like swing to it. I actually noticed that there are a lot of tracks in this show were kind of like analogues of the opening theme, either played in different ways or with different instruments, and can you blame them? With an opening theme that good, who wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to get more use out of it? The animation for the opening gets a lot better in season two, of course, but they keep the same song.\n\nFun fact: I actually bought the soundtrack to Sailor Moon classic on Ebay, and not for a cheap price, just so I could have\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s avoid spoilers and just say \u00e2\u0080\u009cA certain violin track from the later episodes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen it, you know what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m talking about. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to die for.\n\nThere have been two English dubs for this series, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m ashamed to admit that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never seen the old Dic one. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen some clips of it, and if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m being honest, none of it really inspired me to check out more. As I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said, my initial exposure was SuperS, and I distinctly remember the actor for Sailor Moon in that show being unlistenable, so for me, Stephanie Sheh is nothing short of a step up. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gushed about her talent and range in previous reviews, but her abilities may have been a bit too good for this role, because Usagi is supposed to be an annoying and childish character more often than not, and of course, Stephanie delivers a childish and annoying performance\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not saying it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not accurate, but intentional annoyance is still annoying. She does capture all of the characters positive attributes too, of course, which goes a long way in portraying the character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growth, so props to Sheh on doing a solid job that does, occasionally, backfire in unavoidable ways.\n\nThe rest of the main female cast is rounded out by industry veterans, and while Kate Higgins and Cherami Leigh don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have that much to do in their roles as Mercury and Venus\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll talk more about them later\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They still do fine jobs with what they were given. Amanda C Miller hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t done as much anime work as her peers, as she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only really been active since 2011, but she is fantastic as Sailor Jupiter, evoking strength, compassion and vulnerability on par with Christine Auten\u00e2\u0080\u0099s portrayal of Sakaki-san in Azumanga Daioh. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also not afraid to get whimsically goofy when her character gets lost in another boy-crazy fantasy. Cristina Vee is a name I always look for in a dub, and she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t disappoint here with the character of Sailor Mars, which easily could have been written off as a stereotypical tsundere. Even with these names in the cast, however, my favorite performance is from Michelle Ruff as the herald of the Moon Kingdom, Luna, a talking black cat whose motherly tone conveys both the endless patience and long-suffering good humor that living with someone like Usagi would inevitably breed in someone.\n\nOf course, Johnny Yong Bosch also plays a cat, the male named Artemis, and he does fine despite not having as much screen time. The rest of the cast is made up of both veterans and newcomers, with the most noticeable extras being Vic Mignogna as a boy with ESP, Wendee Lee as Princess Serenity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother, and a handful of appearances from Veronica Taylor in small roles. speaking of newcomers, Robbie Daymond had his official anime debut in this show as Mamoru Chiba, who would eventually be revealed as Tuxedo mask(If that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a spoiler, then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re too young to be reading my work), and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s had a major career boom ever since, which he fully deserves. He plays both a normal sardonic teenager and a heroic boy-scout just fine, but he especially shines as a villain in the latter story arcs. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no easy feat, of course, when the villains of this show are being played by experienced VAs like Todd Haberkorn and Liam O\u00e2\u0080\u0099brien. The writing of the dub is also extremely faithful, from what I can gather from the subtitles, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a dub I highly recommend checking out.\n\nSo, this is normally the part of the review where I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d start getting into things like the depths and themes of the writing, but Sailor Moon is a little different from the shows I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d normally tackle, as there really isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any depth of theme to it. Instead, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to start off by addressing a very recent criticism of the series\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 That it exploits the sexuality of teenagers. If you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen the Nostalgia Critic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s review of the series, he talks about the ethics of using 14 year old characters for fanservice, and uses that as a platform to discuss the issue of underage sexuality in Japan. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get me wrong, that IS a topic worthy of discussion, and he does a really smart job of it, but I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help feeling like Sailor Moon didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really deserve to be the focus. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s practically a rule that in order to get deep into anime, you have to come to terms with the sight of underage characters being displayed in revealing outfits, or even less than that, sometimes full-on nude. That doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean you have to be okay with it, although it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of easy to rationalize them as fictional characters drawn by the hand of an artist, or you can just get used to condemning and criticizing it. Your reaction is your own to discover and own.\n\nHaving said that, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get why Sailor Moon was the anime chosen to lead this discussion. Maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my asexuality talking, but I really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find anything sexual about this series, let alone it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s underage characters. Nothing sexual ever happens or even gets alluded to. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen a ton of anime that featured underaged nudity, from tasteless examples like Strike Witches to surprisingly tasteful examples like the last episode of B Gata H K. Okay, the transformation sequences kind of count, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just featureless outlines, no more explicit than the Tempur-Pedic logo before it had it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ass crack removed. Aside from a relatively tame beach episode, the girls never shove cleavage in our faces, and only once or twice shown bathing in G-rated fashion. I get westerners finding the sailor outfit sexy, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just ordinary schoolgirl uniforms in Japan, and their actual hero-versions of those uniforms go one step further by being leotards, so even a skirt-flip like the one that freaked Doug out are no more revealing than watching a ballerina dance.\n\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a LOT worse out there in the anime world, but more to the point, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot worse in America, too. Let me just try out my cringeworthy Joker impersonation here\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen 14 year old Morty gets buck-naked, nobody panics because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all part of the plan. When the Simpsons movie shows us a ten year old\u00e2\u0080\u0099s uncensored penis, nobody panics, because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all part of the plan. But put one 14 year old girl in a sailor suit with a short skirt, then everyone starts losing their minds!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m really sorry if you actually imagined the voice for that. Anyway, rather than sexuality, it would make a lot more sense to use this show as a jumping-off point for a discussion about sexism, which isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a HUGE problem in this show, but it does exist. In a lot of cases, Tuxedo Mask does have to step in when Usagi starts to fuck up, and while I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think the writers intended to insult an entire gender here\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They were probably just building up to the future reveals about the two, and Usagi does start to become much more confidant and self-sufficient down the line\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It can get a little annoying, and understandably offensive to some viewers.\n\nHonestly, the sexism in the series is at it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worst when the writers seem conscious of it, and try to subvert it. The first really great episode of the series(And to be fair, there are no shortage of really great episodes) took place on an enchanted love cruise, and not only did it feature some of the best character writing for everybody present, but the girls managed to save the day all by themselves in spectacular fashion. And yet for some reason, one episode later, they aired the worst episode of the series, where they have their final encounter with Jadeite, and they actually TRIED to be non-sexist in the most blatant and on the nose way possible. Not only is the episode brain-breakably stupid(Seeing the sailor guardians running away from planes instead of turning around and taking advantage of their bulky size was pretty hilarious, IMO), but they had Jadeite call out the ineffectiveness of female heroes, despite never showing any signs of sexism, just to set out a very vocal girl power message from the heroes, who wind up rescuing Tuxedo Mask, who didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even need to be there in the previous episode.\n\nAnd yeah, the show is really fucking stupid. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s usually not too obvious a problem\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 lapses in logic in a show like this are largely forgivable\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But there are exceptions. People not recognizing Usagi as Sailor Moon despite her face and hair always being the same is something you get used to really quickly, but when they do a story arc where the villains are trying overly-complicated methods to find out who she is, you start to wonder why her frisbee throwing skills and clumsy dancing are considered easier targets than literally everything going on above her neck. You do not solve problems by calling attention to them, especially problems we were already ignoring. But the biggest crime that the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stupidity causes is with the introduction of Sailor Mercury, who was supposed to be the smart character in the group, but then again, you need to have smart writers to write smart characters. Usagi may have grown as a character throughout the series, but the other characters were still needed to pull the series along.\n\nSailor Mercury has the same problem that Maka from Soul Eater had\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 She was brought in to be the smart character, but since the series itself wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t up to par on writing intelligence, we pretty much have to take their word for it. She spouts exposition, operates technology to reveal more exposition, gets good grades and studies a lot, but she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t add any intelligence to the show or the dynamic of the group. Honestly, in practice, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more brave and self-sacrificing than smart. Rei, on the other hand, instantly makes the show better with her introduction. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meant to be the passionate character, and she does add some resolve to the group, and since passion conflicts with Usagi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy-going nature, she provides a desperately needed foil for her. She also brings perception, which is MUCH easier to write than intelligence, as her communications with spirits and ability to sense auras help the group to avoid threats and identify traps more often. She doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always save the show, just look at that Jadeite episode, but she does way more good than harm.\n\nSailor Jupiter doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really add anything specific to the group, at least not that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obvious. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s characterized as the Strength girl, and yeah, the group does subtly get stronger with her in it. Even if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t notice this, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very well written and fleshed out character, much like Sailor Mars and Sailor Moon. From the research that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done, her and Mars are the most popular characters out of the main five, what with Mars being mature and responsible and Jupiter being the gentle giant with a heart of gold, both having distinctly unique identities outside of the team, and also having unique relationships with Usagi, so it makes sense they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be at the top of the list. But then you have Sailor Venus, who you THINK is going to have a major story surrounding her on account of her posing as Sailor V and technically being the first active guardian, but no, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just dropped into the cast and immediately absorbed into it, and I cannot for the life of me describe her in any way other than a little bit of plot relevance.\n\nAlmost everything I know about her, other than her hair color and length, and the few scant facts mentioned above, I had to get from outside sources. Apparently she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the empathetic character and her element is Metal, none of which was ever made apparent to me in the show. Yeah, she gets developed a lot more in other media, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beside the point. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have that much filler and tell me you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have time to make me care about one of your biggest characters. And of course, speaking of filler, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re about to dive head first into one of my biggest problems with this series\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Not how formulaic the episodes are, oh no, I can deal with that. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so far beyond used to that kind of thing. My problem is with the structure of the series. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know this from personal research\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I actually learned it from another reviewer\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But apparently, the first three volumes of the manga are represented by the first 66 episodes of the anime\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Which is all 46 episodes of this series plus 20 from it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sequel series, Sailor Moon R.\n\nI have no problem believing this, because my God do they take their sweet ass time with the story. Before I even learned this tidbit, I had formed a working hypothesis that they planned out the episode length of the series, picked out where each special event or plot development would happen, and filled the empty spaces with repetitive, formulaic filler, each stretch of episodes having it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own basic plot idea. This is why unlike most shows, where there\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be a couple of bad episodes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Even Cowboy Bebop had one\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Sailor Moon has bad STRETCHES of episodes, about three of them by my count. The first stretch began with the first episode, and ended with the introduction of Rei. The second stretch began with the final Jadeite intro and ended when Nephrite finally became interesting, and the final one happened between Venus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s introduction and when they gave up trying to figure out who Sailor Moon was. But honestly, out of 46 episodes, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the majority of the series. Far from it.\n\nIf you can get over the repetition and formula, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of good material here. While some of the characters fall flat, like Sailor Venus in particular, the rest of them are well written and fully realized. Usagi may not be as likeable as a main character and leader like Luffy, but she has just as many personality-based weaknesses that keep her from ever feeling like a Mary Sue or an over-powered badass. I loved the villains in particular\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, at least the ones serving as Queen Beryl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s henchman. Yeah, they were definitely evil, but they were also three dimensional, with personalities and motivations of their own, as well as their own connections and relationships beyond their job. Nephrite\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story arc in particular was one of the main reasons that I was able to have such a major soft spot for this series, allowing me to forgive all of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obvious problems. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also perfectly safe for younger viewers, although the younger male demographic might not get as much out of it. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say at the very least it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth checking out.\n\nSailor moon is available from Viz Media. There have been various home video releases in the past, but to my knowledge, this is the first one to present the series the way it was intended, so I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think those ones count. There have been countless sequel series and OVA and movie spin-offs and I dare not name them all here, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re easy to look up. A side manga called Codename Sailor V, which carries the bulk of Sailor Venus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character development and identity, is available stateside from Kodansha Comics. A recent remake of the original series called Sailor Moon Crystal is also available from Viz, and features the same cast, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not as good. What a surprise, a more manga-accurate retelling of a previously successful anime isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as good. The live action series is NOT available stateside, but the original manga is.\n\nGetting into this anime 25 years after it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s release, and watching with the eyes of a 31 year old man, I was expecting it to be the cringiest thing ever. I was expecting something along the lines of a ghetto super hero version of Super Gals! Which was the last anime I can remember dropping. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Even the bad stuff, of which there was a considerable amount, was campy and awkward enough that I could get a good laugh out of it. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll admit that I went easy on it, compared to other titles that have crossed my path, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because I was having too much fun to focus on nitpicking. It could get dark and serious when it wanted, and thankfully it did so at all the right times, taking a shockingly Wolf\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-Rain-esque turn towards the end. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be willing to watch it a second time, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad I watched it once, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be happy to watch the sequel series, in order to see what happens next. I am Naru the Narcissist, lazy guardian of sloth and pretension, and in the name of the moon, I give Sailor Moon a 6/10.

She lets her brother go off unsupervised to use the bathroom and pick up some drinks, and she waits outside for him, tweeting about how much she wants the world to just break apart.\n\nNo sooner does she post this message than the legendary city of Tokyo is hit by a massive magnitude 8.0 earthquake, shaking the convention center to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foundation and causing a catastrophic amount of death and destruction to the city. By hanging onto the guard rail outside of the center, Mirai is able to safely get a clear birds eye view of the damage, but her brother is still inside! With the help of gold-hearted motorcyclist and struggling single mother Mari, Mirai finds Yuuki, and the three of them get out just in time as as the first of many aftershocks hits. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re out of the convention center, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not out of the woods yet, as they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still miles away from home, blocked off by seemingly endless destruction. Together, the three of them must traverse the ruins of a great city, encountering people who have lost everything as they strive to hold onto what little they have left, but with danger at every corner, aftershocks striking when they least expect it, and no means of contacting home, do they even stand a chance?\n\nTokyo Magnitude 8.0 was produced by Studio Bones, and it was a pretty solid effort. I honestly don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have anything to complain about with the animation here. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of walking and talking which really doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t require that much money to keep up in terms of quality, and the extra money clearly got poured into the heavier action scenes and a few very beautiful art pieces, none of which last nearly long enough to truly appreciate their eye candy potential. There are a few moments that feel a bit undercut, like they had to go cheap to compensate for a more complicated visual down the line, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re few and far between, and they never really last long enough to matter. The bulk of the budget was most likely spent on the earthquake itself, which often looks so viscerally realistic that you could swear you were actually there, trying to survive it alongside our young heroes. The running animations, along with all of the practical effects like rubble falling, dust flying through the air and people bracing themselves against each impact lend the series a truly harrowing feel.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never been to Tokyo, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know much about it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s geography or infrastructure, so I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really speak as to how accurately it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s portrayed in this series, but the level of detail in the architecture is breathtaking. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost a shame to see these buildings collapse and crumble, because it feels like they put a ton of time and effort into drawing them as intricately as they did. They took great strides to make everything look as realistic as possible, so not only are the buildings themselves thoroughly designed, but the destruction as well is truly awe inspiring, creating an appropriately post-apocalyptic mood that I normally only see in video games that actually DO take place in a post apocalyptic setting. There were parts where characters would be poking around inside of a building, and I was half-expecting a zombie or even a Clicker to pop out. This makes the sense of devastation and isolation feel real, bringing a heart-pounding level of immersion to the ravaged wasteland that Tokyo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s become.\n\nThe characters are about as realistic in proportion as Bones characters can possibly get, with the only real fantasy element being the giant eyes of all the children in the story. Aside from that, characters are believably proportioned, with heads the appropriate size in comparison to their bodies, uniformly dark colored hair and normal, almost boring looking clothing. They do look a bit cartoony when juxtaposed against the more realistic backgrounds, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a nitpick. The lighting changes noticeably to match the time of day, at times hitting a beautiful twilight glow, and there are certain moments where the color mix is just exquisite. A few of these scenes are strongly tied to some heavy spoilers, but the one example I think I can give you is when Mirai, Mari and Yuuki stop by a shelter, they sit by the edge of a small pool, and the reflection on the surface is a blend of colors that Mirai compares to stained glass windows, and she is not even slightly exaggerating. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very good looking show all around, but you might want to watch this particular scene a few times through.\n\nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really have a lot to say for Koh Otani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s musical score. It blends into the show so well that you barely notice it unless you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re deliberately listening to it, and when I play it out of context, it just comes off as a little generic\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Not bad by any means, just the same kind of score that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard in a million other anime. My personal disconnect with the material might be why I have such a hard time feeling any emotional impact from his work on this project, and if so, I guess that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on me. It does it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job. I had a very similar reaction to the opening theme, Kimi no Uta by Abingdon Boys School\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Weird name for a band, unless it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually a music class that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s responsible for this song\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Played over what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m assuming were production sketches from the developmental stages of the series. Once again, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fine, but doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really stand out in any way. I actually strongly preferred the ending theme, M/Elody by Shion Tsuji, which had a really Indie feel to it, even though it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visuals were just photographs of Mirai and Yuuki walking.\n\nThe English dub is a little on the mediocre side, too. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bad, I mean, I actually think Luci Christian pulled off an exceptionally strong performance as Mirai, all things considered. The character does very little but complain and act like a sourpuss for the majority of the series, and Luci\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grounded, subtle performance made her sound like a long suffering teen who thinks she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s over the world, even though she clearly cares about her family, and she managed to bring a deep sadness to the character whenever she needed to. Tiffany Grant played the younger Yuuki, and while she proved she could be just as unrecognizable in a child role as Christine Auten has in the past, she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have much to work with out of unrestrained happy-go-lucky loudness and the occasional crying. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never found Shelley Callene Black to be the strongest emoter\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Unless she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s playing a really strong or cold role, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always found sort of a wall of insincerity in her way\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 So I think I would have enjoyed better casting in her role as Mari. Greg Ayres and Brittany Karbowski also pop up here and there, playing extras and one-shot characters, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hit and miss.\n\nSo here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the thing. There are a lot of things we anime fans have in common in the way we judge anime, and there are a lot of values and standards that most of us share, but if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found to stand out in particular, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that we all seem to love a good tear jerker. I always see people giving exuberantly high ratings to any anime that gives them that incurable emotional illness, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Feels.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If an anime makes you cry, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an instant masterpiece, regardless of whatever problems it may have had throughout. I know I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not the only person who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s noticed this, because there are a lot of anime that have taken advantage of it to compensate for other major issues in their stories, effectively using shameless tragedy porn to grab people by the hearts and string them along for an easy 10/10 score that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty much guaranteed to them, and if you complain about the logical or ethical fallacies that people have missed or just straight up ignored, they criticize you for nitpicking, saying you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gotta watch the series with your heart and not your head, or that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking too much, just turn your brain off and have a good time.\n\nThe backlash for some of these titles can be devastating, like for people who saw through the epic romance of Sword Art Online, but for most shows, emotional manipulation can lead to large and highly defensive fanbases. Clannad makes them cry, so who cares about the blatant harem aspects, or the fact that it all centers around a reprehensible deadbeat asshole? Who cares about the fact that the characters whose deaths you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re crying over are written so badly that you feel worse for the person losing them than you do for them in the first place? Who cares if stories like Angel Beats and Steins Gate don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make any sense, and are full of game breaking plot holes? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the feels, damn it, the feeeeeeells! Which is why, when I get around to watching a show that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been touted as heart breaking and emotionally powerful, I normally approach with caution, lest I be tempted and eventually let down by another predictable, cliched title that confuses tragedy with drama. So where does Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 fall in my rankings?\n\nWell, unfortunately, talking about the lauded \u00e2\u0080\u0098big tragic twist\u00e2\u0080\u0099 at the end of this series is gonna take us to some heavy places, so let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s instead start by talking about something more basic, the story and characters. This series is about three people trying to survive a natural disaster, and pretty much nothing else. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no real depth, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no real message, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a straight journey through the devastated town to get back home. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not necessarily a bad thing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I mean, I loved homeward Bound as a kid\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really nothing wrong with a simple or shallow story, and it does have a strong concept, even if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not really trying to say anything with it. Even the worst concept can be carried by great characters, so let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s see who we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working with on THAT front. We only have three major characters, with plenty of other named roles popping in an out of the story before being ultimately forgotten, and since those main roles consist of two children who we presumably wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to see die and an adult risking her life and chances to make it back home just to watch over them, we could easily form a serious bond with our survivors.\n\nOur main character is of course the tween-aged Mirai, with her little brother Yuuki serving as costar, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re total opposites as far as one being extremely positive and the other one being extremely negative, and the story treats them both like crap because of it. Mirai is the negative one, and she is constantly getting shit dumped on her as a result. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sour, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s poutty, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ungrateful, and it feels like she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s constantly getting punished for it. A note to any aspiring writers out there\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like your main character either, then either develop them or make them likeable, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t splatter hot food on them. You probably think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m exaggerating, but the most development or nuance she gets is that she occasionally shows concern for people, which, congratulations, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve just surpassed the bare minimum of not being a sociopath. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve proven you can stop bitching long enough to cry and worry about people, that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give you a free pass to be the less interesting version of Grumpy Cat.\n\nAnd then you have her little brother, the happy go lucky Yuuki, who takes things to the other extreme, being positive and acting upbeat for at least 95 percent of his screen time. In fact\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Wait, how mean do I want to get with this? Screw it, no holding back now. He has all the personality and emotional range of a puppy. The only thing about him that makes him even remotely relatable beyond the bare idea of childhood is his love of robots, but aside from that, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more of a McGuffin than a character. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really talk about my biggest problems with him without giving away some very heavy spoilers, so instead, you know what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to do? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to spend the rest of the review just calling him Mirai\u00e2\u0080\u0099s puppy, just to see if it ever becomes a problem. Mirai has a puppy that she took to Tokyo for some reason, it walks around making unimportant barking noises, feeling way too joyful for the situation, worrying about his other humans that he hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen in a while, and constantly running off and causing trouble. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fucking puppy.\n\nAnd then you have Mari, who\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 honestly, I really wanted to like her. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s saintly, mature, responsible, she takes two children into her care without a thought for her own well being\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, mainly because I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe her. No, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not calling her a liar, I just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe in the existence of a person like her. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m stretching things too far when I call her a Mary-Sue, and if you think I am then PLEASE, tell me what her flaws are. Even if you can believe in her as a person, and that she basically adopted Mirai and Yuuki for their trip home, why stop at them? Why form this three person group, and then just stop there? What makes those two kids so special that she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to invite anyone else to join? They meet other people on their journey. They meet other CHILDREN on their journey, but no, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the three quakesketeers, because the idea of a single mother joining forces with two unaccompanied minors in a fight for survival is more marketable, I guess. And yes, I seriously wish they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d added more people to their group, because obviously their dynamic as it is does not work for me.\n\nIf there was ever an anime that badly needed a larger cast, it was this one. Rather than just three characters and a bunch of small cameos from other people, I kinda thought we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d get a much stronger exploration of the earthquake and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s devastation if the series were more of an anthology piece, switching back and forth between different characters whose paths would occasionally converge. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll admit that I cared a little about Mari getting home to her daughter and mother, but when it came to Mirai and her puppy(See? I told you I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d do it), I honestly found myself wondering what it was that made them so much more important than anyone else, while I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop thinking about the elderly couple who lost their grandkids, or the woman with a stuck stroller, or Mari\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scavenger friend. Mirai gets depressed over her inability to talk to or console her friend Megu, so how about just letting her do it? It might have actually been interesting to see. And of course there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Kenta, the boy Mirai\u00e2\u0080\u0099s age which obviously means he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll briefly serve as a love interest. I could have seen more of his exploits, although like the others, we never see him again after his appearance, meaning he might as well have died offscreen.\n\nAnd as far as the story goes, all I can really say is that stuff happens. The earthquake itself is probably the only thing that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ever foreshadowed(Aside from the tragic twist, which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to in a minute), and the rest of the anime is just the three main characters either moving in one direction or resting, all while being shaken by aftershocks so plot-specific that they honestly wound up being predictable more often than not. Even my first time through, I called about half of them a second or two before they happened. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say that there aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t some scary moments, or that I never felt my pulse race, but even the most terrifying moment, the collapse of a certain monument that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been featured in a ton of anime before, is ruined in retrospect by the realization that Mirai and her puppy clearly graduated from the Prometheus School of Running Away from Things. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a story about survival at it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core, and while the characters are weak, it does at least manage to tell a story about survival, which is just about the least that was required of it.\n\nSo, the story is bland, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t live up to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s potential, and the characters we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supposed to be rooting for are less interesting than the one shot characters we never see again. If there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anything that can save this anime, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the big tragic twist that everyone and their mothers praise the gospel about, right? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that element to the story that makes it emotionally powerful, heartbreaking, and a true masterpiece of anime tragedy, right? Well, okay, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s examine this, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try to do so with as little spoilers as possible. I will admit that yes, the tragedy is set up really well. The catalyst is subtle, most people either won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t notice it or will just forget it over the course of the next few episodes, and there are just enough clues that I can safely say that someone on the writers team was at least trying to respect the viewer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intelligence. As the clues get bigger, that unsettling feeling of dread creeps in, and the big reveal is built up, and when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s finally time to lift the curtain, the other shoe drops\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 or does it? DUN DUN DUN!!!\n\nYeah, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be honest, I was actually feeling very forgiving of this anime right up until they tried to make a plot twist out of it. They made so many bad decisions surrounding it, at least from my perspective, that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m honestly not sure how to start, or how to even broach the subject. I guess I could start with the fact that they made a twist out of it in the first place, adding a layer of smugness to it that kinda takes away from the sting of it. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really get emotional over it, because I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop seeing the faces of the writers, saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cHah hah! You didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see that coming, did you? Look at how smart we are! We totally got you, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we? We made you think it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen, but it totally did! You fell for it, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Honestly, no, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fall for it. Even my first time through, I saw through their act right from the start, because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not an idiot. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen this exact plot twist before, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen it done so much better. Shyamalan did it better with The 6\u00e2\u0080\u0099th Sense, Goosebumps did it better with The Ghost Next Door, Scrubs did it better with Brendan fucking Frasier, and From the New World did it so well that the reveal hit me like a punch to the gut.\n\nIf burying the tragedy under a plot twist doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t telegraph to you just how manufactured this tragedy actually is, well, this part\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be REALLY hard to talk about without spoiling anything, so instead of talking about it directly, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to talk about some heavy spoilers from Clannad Afterstory and the Studio Ghibli film Grave of the Fireflies. In both of these shows, the emotional highlight involves the death of very young children, but while one is considered an enduring masterpiece by audiences and critics alike, the other is considered by at least half the people who view it as shameless tragedy porn. Keeping this in mind, what separates the emotionally manipulative from the genuinely poignant? Well, in Clannad, the characters we lose\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Both Nagisa and Ushio\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t characters we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supposed to identify with. We identify with Tomoya, so when he loses these characters, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supposed to feel their loss through him, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just about the least dignified reason to kill off a character\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 A death where they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even the focal point. To make matters worse, she just died so she could be brought back to life, like Brian Griffin. Thanks for nothing.\n\nTo be fair, Setsuko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death in Grave of the Fireflies is also in service of another character, her older brother, but the point isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t to make you sympathize with him, nor is it to draw cheap tears just because it wants to. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not trying to make us feel bad for him, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll ignore all of his flaws\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 We know her death is his fault, we know HIS death is his fault, and it carried a powerful message that Japanese youths at the time needed to hear. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a fireflies review, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll let you do your own research about the Japanese crime wave of the late eighties and the bubble economy that wound up popping, but suffice to say, Setsuko and Seita didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just die because people remember tear jerkers\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 There was an actual point to it. There was no point to the tragedy in Tokyo Magnitude 8.0. There was nothing in that story that warranted a sad ending. A story has to earn a tragic ending when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s characters are struggling against fate, but they ultimately fail due to their own flaws and the harshness of reality.\n\nThe tragic ending in 8.0 ultimately comes across as false because the characters, and by extension the story, never earn it. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t struggle, they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t grow, they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have arcs, and the constant bad luck getting thrown their way often just feels like pointless cruelty from the writers, who have nobody but themselves to blame for writing a story that features little more thought than moving game pieces from point A to point B. It feels like a drama or action series, right up until it swings into Tragedy territory because it damn well wants to, and the fact that it has to hide under a hallucination gimmick so ridiculous that the hallucination has to tell the person having it that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a hallucination, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve officially entered territory so pathetic that I honestly would have taken a \u00e2\u0080\u0098ghost\u00e2\u0080\u0099 reveal more seriously. So did this big, tragic twist tug at my heart strings? No, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be lying if I said I felt nothing throughout the series. It had it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moments, and while I found that oh-so-celebrated twist to be pointlessly cruel, I did get a little choked up at certain scenes that took place AFTER the reveal was over. Like I said, it at least did the basics of a survival story competently enough.\n\nTokyo Magnitude 8.0 is available from Maiden Japan, a child company of Sentai Filmworks. It can also be viewed on Hulu.\n\nDespite my griping earlier, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hate this show. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tolerable enough, even if I take some serious issues with it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s writing and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pathetic attempt at an undeserved sad ending. Do I think it should have had a happy ending? Well, it might not be as popular if it had gone that route, but it would have at least felt more true to itself. Of course it would have had to consist of much greater character writing to support this change, and for those of you who think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m asking too much of a show whose cast is mostly comprised of children, I could point you towards plenty of titles that featured well written and interesting child characters\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Lilo and Stitch, pretty much every incarnation of Fullmetal Alchemist, the aforementioned Grave of the Fireflies\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Actually, you know what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the perfect example of this? If you want to watch a series about two young siblings, one positive and one negative, facing danger and uncertainty as they try to make their way home, but both of them are fleshed out and have definitive personalities, check out Over the Garden Wall. For now, though, I give Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 a 5.0/10."}, {"id": 3297, "score": 60, "body": "Ken Kubo was just your ordinary Japanese college student. He had a beautiful girlfriend, a passion for a sport he was genuinely talented at, and a satisfying life with little to no problems to worry about. Everything was going just fine for young Ken, when he ran into an old friend from high school who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dedicated his life to a surprising hobby. Tanaka, having put on a generous portion of weight since their last meeting, has fallen into otaku culture, a certified never never land where adults turn their backs on conventional society to pursue every possible facet of an underground counter-pop-culture revolving around obscure, esoteric subjects such as animation, idol singers, special effects movies and even military paraphernalia. He initially raises his eyebrow at such juvenile fare, but soon finds himself slowly being sucked in, and before he knows it, he gets in way over his head and begins to change on a drastic level, losing both the respect and affection of his girlfriend along with any hint of his old social life.\n\nHaving left everything behind, Ken quickly realizes that the only direction he can move is now forward, so that his newfound passion doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to be a dead end. Instead, he dedicates his life not only to experiencing otaku culture, but changing it, and becoming one with it, so that he may one day become one of the greatest otaku the world has ever known. With the help Tanaka and the rest of his nerdy, passionate friends, Ken Kubo begins to climb the ladder of success as a content creator, overseeing the production of model kits in both Japan and China, all of which is a part of his grand plan to unite all of the otaku of the world in harmony under his rule as the Otaking, leading up to his grand ambition, a future theme park called Otakuland! But when his best friend turns his back on him and sells him out to hand the company over to the least expected person imaginable, will Ken be able to land on his feet, and will the otaku of the world ever live to see the day where they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be respected by society?\n\nOne of the first things you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll want to know about Otaku no video is that, unlike most anime, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not entirely animated. A good chunk of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s running time consists of live action interviews conducted in mockumentary style with different kinds of otakus, and these segments are spliced throughout the ova. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll talk more about those later, but more importantly, with only two 40 minute episodes and large portions of film that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to be animated, you might think it would be really simple to set aside a decent budget for the animation portions. And come on, this is Gainax, even a lot of their earlier works are more or less impressive in the visual department. this is unfortunately not the case, as the animation in this OVA is bare bones at best. It can be unbelievably distracting when there are tons of motionless people in the background, which is sadly all too common, and the best looking scenes are the ones where the only things happening are conversations. The opening video was decently animated, but the rest of the product just looks cheap.\n\nWell, I say it looks cheap, but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily mean it looks bad. There really isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much going on in the animated sections in terms of action, so there really isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any content that can feel short-changed over their shortage of change. Yeah, the backgrounds full of frozen people can be distracting, but most of the content is serviceable enough, with no excess funds needed. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really look like Gainax style animation, but at the very least, it does look like Gainax style artwork. The characters have an aesthetic that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very much of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time, but is still pretty easy on the eyes. People are more or less realistically proportioned, at least from the neck down, with your typical anime facial constructs being really the only thing keeping them from looking real. Characters also cosplay in several scenes, with the costumes they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re wearing being of incredibly detailed quality, more than accurate enough to satisfy any purists sitting at the table. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a great looking anime, but it looks fine.\n\nSo, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all otaku, right? I know I am, and obviously you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be reading this if you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have some level of interest in the anime medium. We all love watching animation from a certain bow-shaped archipelago, and as long as we all have that in common, we can more or less live in harmony together. There may be some truth to this, but where people tend to differ is where it comes to their otaku origin stories. We all discovered and embraced anime differently, from people who watched kids anime from a young age to people who just so happened to have their imaginations sparked by that one anime film they saw at a friends\u00e2\u0080\u0099 house. In Otaku no video, the main character was a normal, average person, and he was drawn into otaku culture from his old life because\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not clear about what exactly started it, but it was either his friends\u00e2\u0080\u0099 level of passion, the fact that he could watch and out of print TV show on taped cassettes, or seeing that one girl in a fur bikini cosplay. Whatever it was, he came into the fandom as an adult, and was drawn in from the outside world. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know about you, but this couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be more different from my story.\n\nUnlike Ken Kubo, I was born to be an otaku. If you follow the original Japanese definition of the word, someone who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obsessed with something to the point of over-indulgence, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty much always described me. As a child I was an otaku for Power Rangers and Xmen, then I moved onto Star Wars, and later on in life I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have similar experiences with RWBY, MLP Friendship is Magic, and the WWE. I would focus on these things so tightly that I would scare my friends and family away from the same properties. To this day, my brother still feels an aversion towards anything I get into. Seriously, after I got my PS4, his drive to buy one himself instantly died out, and he never touched mine in the year that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had it. I have a tendency to approach things cautiously and skeptically, but then to dive in head first as soon as my toe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the water. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had numerous otaku-like obsessions throughout my life, but looking back, none of them hit me as hard as Pokemon did. That franchise landed me like a prize bass, and it ultimately worked as my gateway anime as a result, just like it has for a lot of people.\n\nI went HARD into Pokemon. It dominated my life to the point that I could see myself being one of the people interviewed in Otaku no video, were it made today. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel comfortable going into relevant experiences without a mosaic covering my face, but trust me, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t healthy. Thankfully, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proximity to Cardcaptors on Kids WB set me on the beginning of a much better path. Cardcaptors(No, not Cardcaptor Sakura, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not proud of this) soon took over for it in my heart, and managed to get me into fanfic writing, which got me into writing in general. I would eventually move onto other TV anime, such as Dragonball Z and Sailor Moon, before titles like Azumanga Daioh, Excel Saga and Chobits took me deeper into the medium, seeking out titles that weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t immediately available at the time. Getting a full-time job also really helped, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allowed me to pour money into the medium, often to my own detriment, and I eventually wound up giving back to the community through a blog that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been running for four years strong. My obsessive tendencies haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t gone away, as I still feel the need to buy merchandise and become a part of everything I get into, but I doubt I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll ever grow out of that.\n\nNow, why did I go out of my way to tell you all about my journey as an otaku? Well, first of all, because Otaku no Video doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really offer a lot of discussion points of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own. That may sound harsh of me, but second of all, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really relate to any of it, as my story is so obviously different from theirs. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t doubt that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of people out there who can watch this anime, point to the screen at various moments and proclaim \u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how it was for me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but I really can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Maybe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not the target audience, because I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come up the way they did, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not well versed in classic anime(I mean come on, most old shows are at least one hundred episodes long), and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel so attached to the sanctity of otaku lifestyle that I need to see it given a blowjob just to feel more contented with my own life choices. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t catch most of the references, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel compelled to look them up, and while I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been able to acknowledge the existence of passion as a positive life lesson before, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel as important here.\n\nPart of it has to do with the fact that this anime wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really intended to have a great story attached to it. One of the over-all themes I picked up on was one of nostalgia, and sure enough, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been told by a few sources that Otaku no video is a semi-autobiographical tale about the founding of Gainax, through the love, passion, tragedy and triumph that got it where it is today\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 As well as 18 years in the still-distant future, because hey why not be optimistic? I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how much of \u00e2\u0080\u009cGiant X\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u009d history accurately represents Gainax\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own tale, but it does offer a strong argument for no compelling story or plot being needed. After all, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re telling someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s real life story, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no call to embellish the facts for the sake of entertainment. Well, you can say that, but when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re telling your life story in 1991, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re patting yourself on the back for events that take place in 1999 and 2035, maybe throwing in a little spice to keep the viewer entertained isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the worst thing you can possibly do. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just saying.\n\nBecause as it is, I certainly didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hate this anime, but I also found it really difficult to get invested in it. Rather than an actual story, it felt like footnotes, only giving us about one brief scene from each year of the fictitious company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history, and who the hell knows what happened inbetween? For all we know, the guy with the weird sleeping habits had a drinking problem. For all we know, Ken and Tanaka were almost turned against each other by a love triangle with the cute cosplaying lady. For all we know, somebody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parents died, affecting their attitude and convictions. All we ever get is \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis happened, then this happened, then this happened\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d And while all of it is relevant in some way to the over-all plot, I felt so little attachment to the stakes and characters that I found myself dozing off multiple times during the much more fast-paced second episode. Then again, maybe that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good thing, because from what I hear, one of the things I missed was seeing a porn enthusiast who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trying to find a way to circumvent Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decency laws jerk off on camera. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m kind of glad I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get to see that.\n\nAnd speaking of the live action segments, they are pretty interesting. They act as a counterbalance to the anime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shameless trumpeting of otaku pride by showing off the other side of the coin, how these types of obsessions can dominate and potentially ruin a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not entirely negative, of course, and offers a fair and honest look at the real human faces behind otaku culture. It introduces us to people who are obviously deviating from social norms, but to them, what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing is completely normal, even if it results in perpetual virginity. Everybody they show us is fascinating in their own way, from a military geek who\u00e2\u0080\u0099d fit in quite well with America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s paintball culture, a gashapon enthusiast who likes to disassemble merchandise he gets and construct his own parts for them if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not to his liking, somebody who records rare video(I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to imagine he, or a close relative, is now making a killing off of youtube), and even a few criminals who buy and sell animation cells from anime production companies. This alone would make up for a lot of the anime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s failings, if it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for the overwhelming evidence that all of these interviews were staged, and starred Gainax employees under false names.\n\nOtaku no Video is available from Animeigo in both video cassette and DVD, which despite being out of print for respectively twenty-four and fourteen years, is still pretty easy to find online at an affordable price. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no English dub, but honestly, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really find that surprising.\n\nIf you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell by the length of this review, I had a very difficult time writing a piece on this particular OVA. It almost defies review, because by it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very nature, the story it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s telling doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to be fleshed out or well written. It had a very specific goal, to cater to a very specific group of fans, which just happen to be the same kinds of fans that Gainax is made of. Even 26 years later, modern day otaku who grew up on the anime of the seventies and eighties can still find a fulfilling experience in it. I guess that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why, at the end of the day, the word that I think best describes Otaku no Video would be esoteric, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ultimately why it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so hard to place a rating on it. I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t watched a lot of older anime, and with my time now being eaten up by a full time job and a blog that I need to constantly be writing reviews for, I probably never will, once again considering just how long a lot of those shows ran. I feel bad giving it a negative score when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so very explicitly not part of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s target audience, especially seeing how beloved it is to people from it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intended crowd, so I guess in the end there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing I can do but take it on faith and shoot for the middle ground. I give Otaku no video a 6/10.  "}, {"id": 3310, "score": 60, "body": "Iblard Jikan (Iblard Time in English), is an interesting experience. The best way to describe Iblard Jikan is that it's like looking through a window into another world, and getting a brief glimpse of the potential beauty that the world your looking at offers.\n\nThere isn't much to talk about in Iblard Jikan, as there is no real plot or characters to speak of, and there isn't really a need for one. The entire short exists just to show a slice of the world it created. What few characters we see are brief cameos by characters from other Ghibli projects that are added into the paintings, as a way of showing that the world you are watching is alive and there are stories going on even if you don't know any of the details.\n\nThe OVA was released as part of the Ghibli ga Ippai Collection and was directed by Naohisa Inoue. This short takes place in the fantasy world of Iblard, originally depicted in paintings by Inoue, which were inspired by the fantasy sequences of Ghibli's Whisper of the Heart. Studio Ghibli produced this short by digitally animating portions of the paintings and integrating original elements into the scenery.\n\nThere are a total of eight separate segments, each featuring a different painting or landscape, accompanied by an instrumental musical piece, making it feel like it's a journey all around the world that it's showing to you. The OVA has an original soundtrack composed by Kiyonori Matsuo, all of which match the laid back tone of the artwork. The result is a wonderfully relaxing experience to sit through.\n\nIblard Jikan is the type of media that is hard to give a score to, since it relies only on what the viewer is thinking or feeling. It would be easy to throw around works like \"delightful\" and \"thought provoking\", but this experience can't really be summed up by a simple review like this one. And the whole thing is one of those 'love it or hate it' experiences.\n\nIt's also hard to recommend to everyone since it's a 30 minute art piece that's simply meant to relax the watcher and bring them into the brief glimpses of the world it presents, but I'm sure the audience that it was intended for would get exactly what they're looking for out of it, as it makes for something nice to put on when you want to just unwind, fall asleep, simply something to have in the background."}, {"id": 3314, "score": 60, "body": "Jun Sakurada is a teenage boy who has left school and refuses to leave the house. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doted on hand and foot by his older sister, Nori, who he lives with. You know, because this is an anime, and teenage protagonists living with their parents would just be heresy. He occupies his time by ordering a bunch of junk online, using it briefly, and then returning it just in time to exploit Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0098cooling off period\u00e2\u0080\u009d law. One day, he receives an offer that asks him one simple question: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you wind it, or won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He clicks yes out of bored curiosity, and not long after, a suitcase appears on his floor, containing a beautiful blonde ball-joint doll in a red southern belle dress.\n\nHe winds this doll, as per his promise, and is shocked when it actually wakes up and starts talking to him! It\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I mean, she\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Introduces herself as Shinku, the fifth in a series of magical Rozen Maiden dolls, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been selected to be her servant! With this haughty totty ordering him around, and a bunch of other dolls arriving at his house via airmail(I mean that literally, they crash through his window), will this hikikomori\u00e2\u0080\u0099s0 life ever be the same? Or will it forever be changed by his involvement with these dueling dolls and their mysterious \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlice Game?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen I first watched Rozen Maiden, I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very impressed by the animation quality, but I was willing to give it a pass\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 After all, as dated as it looked, it was probably one of the better looking shows of the late nineties, right? But then I saw online that it came out in 2004, and I sat there in a stunned silence until I came across the name Studio Nomad, and I understood a little better. See, Nomad is a studio comprised of former Madhouse and Pierrot staff, and neither of those companies have ever really been anywhere near the forefront of production quality, especially back in the early aughts. I reviewed a Pierrot title a while back(Twelve Kingdoms), and while I gave it an 8/10 in general, the animation was one of the few factors that kept it from getting the higher score that I wanted to give it.\n\nAnd Rozen Maiden just happens to have been the first outing for Studio Nomad, which just makes matters even less promising. The animation isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d call ugly\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Trust me, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re nowhere near a Deen or Xebec level of bad\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take a trained eye to see how low their budget must have been. Character movements are jerky and clunky, and they can look off-model in several shots. The visual direction is pretty good, as the people in charge of this were clearly trying to make their product look better than it was destined to look, but there was only so much they could do with it. The only time the animation really starts to impress is during the fight scenes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yes, these ball-joint dolls fight each other, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as awesome as it sounds\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 So I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give them credit for that. The action, when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening, is kinetic and a lot of fun to watch.\n\nThe artwork, however, is really weird in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presentation. For the parts of the story that take place in the dream world, the visuals are striking, highly imaginative and full of very beautiful, very tonally appropriate imagery, and I loved watching the characters interacting with these lovingly crafted environments. In the real world, however, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nowhere near as interesting. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of detail, to be sure, but it still feels kind of lifeless and flat, and the characters just feel tacked on, like stickers on a television screen. The character designs are pretty neat, though, especially with the dolls, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s colors schemes and outfits say a lot about their personalities and dispositions.\n\nAs for the English dub\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Woof. This is easily one of the more annoying ones I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had the chance to hear. That might just be me, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The main two actors are Mela Lee and Mona Marshall, who were both highly prevalent at the time of this dub\u00e2\u0080\u0099s release, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not a fan of either of them. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll draw much ire for putting down Mela Lee, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice just sounds like the audio equivalent of Splenda in most of her roles, but I might just be angering a substantial fandom when I place Marshall in the same ballpark. So let me explain.\n\nI respect Mona\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body of work\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I mean, how can you not respect somebody who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s played more cartoon characters than Daws Butler and Mel Blanc combined? And she has a very impressive amount of range and talent, but when she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s playing young boys, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about as convincing as Zac Efron in The Lorax. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind it as much in Wolf\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Rain, as he was kind of a quiet character, but as Jun, her voice is just all over the place. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the one kind of role I never really like her in, and to say she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worse than Mela Lee in this dub just sounds excessively cruel\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true. The rest of the cast isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any better, as they seem to range from soft and screechy to soft and waify. At least Sherry Lynn sounds like she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s having fun as Hina Ichigo, but Mela Lee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance in the role of Shinku just sounds like she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reading her lines off of a cue card. Which is a shame, because she nailed the character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s upper crust accent.\n\nThe only real saving grace of the dub is Karen Strassman in the role of Suiginto, the villain of the series. While the original seiyuu did sound creepy and sinister, Strassman actually kind of outperforms her, adding layers of bitter pain and jealousy to the mix. Which is great, because as we find out, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly the kind of jilted antagonist she is. Unfortunately, one solid performance is not enough to base a recommendation on, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to have to call \u00e2\u0080\u0098sub over dub\u00e2\u0080\u0099 on this one. The music, while serviceable, is still pretty generic and repetitive, with standard plinky slice-of-life tunes dominating most of the soundtrack, and an instrumental version of the opening being thrown in for a lot of the action scenes.\n\nWhen talking about the story and writing of Rozen Maiden, there are three different sides to it that need to be examined. The first one is the main plot, revolving around Suiginto and The Alice Game. It can be a little confusing if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not paying attention, but the goal of the game is apparently to be the first doll who meets Father, the man who created them. This plot is the reason all of the action in the series exists, and with Suiginto at it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core, it also gives the series a pretty solid, intimidating antagonist. It creates some very high stakes, not only for the few dolls you actually care about, but for their human masters as well\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And even for Suiginto. The problem is that when you get right down to it, the villain is the only character who actually wants something to happen. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not a fan of main characters who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only goal is to preserve the status quo and live a peaceful life, and the entire cast doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want anything other than to exist. It makes it kind of hard to root for them, because when nothing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\nThe second side of the story is my least favorite of the three, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly the kind of story most of the characters would like to have. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the slice-of-life side. About half of the series\u00e2\u0080\u0099 screen time is centered around Jun, Nori, and the dolls just hanging around the house and interacting with each other. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be lying if I said nothing funny happened here\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 An early gag with Shinku and the toilet had me in stitches\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But for the most part, this show just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very funny. The jokes are either repetitive or just way too drawn-out, and some of the material is just plain painful. And then you have shorelines like the Snow White rehearsal, which was about as pointless as leveling Aeris in FF7, unless you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re actually invested in the romance between Jun and Shinku.\n\nSpeaking of which, the comedy isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the only thing wrong with the slice-of-life side of the story. The other giant problem I had with this show\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Which I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fully understand until my second viewing over the course of this week\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Is that it is, in essence, an elaborate pedophile fantasy. Yeah, I know I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going into lunatic Nancy Grace territory here, but hear me out\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Take away the fact that Shinku and her friends are animated dolls, and Rozen Maiden becomes the kind of series that could most easily be described as a harem where all the options are little girls. They seem to match the loli stereotypes, too\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 You have the precocious one, the tsundere one, the shy waify one, and the hyper Genki one. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like a weird combination of Love Hina and Strawberry Marshmallow.\n\nAnd before you start telling me that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m looking too far into it, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not real loli because the characters in question aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t biological humans, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to point out two things. First of all, the lolis in UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t human, but the show was still really damn creepy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not human\u00e2\u0080\u009d is just a half-assed excuse. And second of all, these characters don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really feel like dolls\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They move independently of their ball joints, to the point that I have to wonder why they have them in the first place, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re biological enough to get hungry, eat, and taste what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re eating. Taking those facts into account, along with the unsettling level of sexual tension between Jun and Shinku, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really hard to hold onto the illusion that these characters really are just walking ball-joint dolls. The \u00e2\u0080\u0098guy takes care of a bunch of little girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 setting is there so the viewer can imagine himself in Jun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoes, and your imagination is exactly where all the debauchery that would never be presented on screen is intended to happen, and with unnecessary suggestive moments like the laundry episode lingering about, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pretty freaking transparent about it.\n\nThe final side of the story is my favorite one, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the development of Jun Sakurada as a character. Rozen Maiden was one of the first stories to try and tackle a Hikikomori character, alongside Chobits and Welcome to the NHK, and it takes a much different approach from those other two. (This part\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bit spoiler-y.) Rather than being a failed college student or a paranoid drug addict, Jun is much more relatable in his circumstances. He was a very impressive student, standing tall as one of the best in his grade, but the attention this got him\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Remember, kids, Japanese schools post your grades on the wall for everyone to see\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Wound up leaving a lot of pressure on his shoulders, with both teachers and students talking him up as a prodigy despite the fact that they only knew him through the pedestal that they were all placing him on. So when he finally started to cave under the pressure and get bad grades, the backlash was unbearable. In addition, he was starting to get teased over his sewing prowess, and it all just crushed him, causing him to have a mental break down and hole himself up in his room.\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some fairly compelling stuff, and the way he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s portrayed whenever he faces the idea of going back there is very strong. It unfortunately culminates in a scene with his sister where she says some things that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s see, how spoilery do I want to get, here\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, she gives him a tearful, emotional pep talk that not only misses the entire point of his character, but it honestly sounds like she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trying to make him feel even more guilty than he already feels. She tells him \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not a horrible person for inconveniencing us, we feel like horrible people for not being able to fix you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Great, so you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to make him feel better by telling him ANOTHER negative impact he had on your lives? Geez, with a sister like you, who needs social anxiety? Oh, and at one point, she totally also has a sex dream about him. Make of that what you will.\n\nI have a theory about this show, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s based solely on season 1\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Which is all I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen so far. My theory is that the dolls aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually real. He ordered them online, in the order and pace that they arrived, and is only imagining the interactions and stories he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s having with them. And his sister\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 His dear sister, who loves him and would do anything for him\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Is playing along, having tea parties and elaborate fantasy play sessions with his little brother and his dolls, all while she wonders(whenever she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s alone with Shinku) whether or not she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing the right thing by enabling him. That would explain why she never has as animated a reaction to the dolls as he does. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of a spitball theory, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no real evidence for it, but try watching the show while thinking about it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It actually kind of makes the series better.\n\nRozen Maiden was originally available from Geneon, which of course means the original balls-expensive DVDs are out of print. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s currently available from Sentai Filmworks, and at this point, there are several different DVD sets you can buy\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s available on Blu-ray outside of Japan, though. Personally, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend the 2011 Sentai box set, which includes this season, plus the second season and a 2 episode OVA. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only five disks and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relatively cheap, but it comes with the disks stacked on top of each other on a single spindle. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible to accidentally crack the disks while pulling them out, so moving them to a safer case is probably a good idea. In addition to the second season and OVAs, there was also a new season in 2013, that was actually dubbed by Sentai, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m expecting a better dub in that set\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Or at least I was, until I saw that Nancy Novotny was playing Nori. Because\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Ew. My least favorite character, played my least favorite actor. THAT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gonna be a fun review. In any case, all four iterations of the franchise are available for streaming on Crunchyroll.\n\nWhile I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d really recommend this series\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t watched the other seasons yet, so my opinion might change\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really a bad anime, either. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of a mixed bag. It has more than it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fair share of problems, especially in terms of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s production values and obvious loli-harem leanings, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a lot of things to love about it. While the art itself is hit or miss, the art design is really strong, and the visuals and imagery can be downright beautiful. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very cute show, very well paced, and while it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not for me, the effectiveness of the humor will vary from viewer to viewer. Fans of Ball-Joint dolls are going to love it to death, and understandably so, as I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think there are any other shows that feature that interest as prominently. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really enjoy it, but I can see why a lot of people would, which is why I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to give Rozen Maiden a 6/10."}, {"id": 3327, "score": 55, "body": "Crest of the Stars is a tale of futuristic fighting between two factions: the \"alien\" race of the Abh and mankind. The Abh aren't necessarily alien as they are enhanced humans - they have altered genes that give them prominent features such as longer youth and blue hair. They were originally intended to be \"living machines\" to mankind but soon found independence on a space voyage for new planets to inhabit. They follow a imperial system, with influential families having elaborate names and taking top positions in the economy or military. Humans are split into 4 differ factions that ultimately make the United Mankind. A majority of the ones shown in the anime carry a grudge against the Abh. This is due to the fact that the Abh have gone from rebels seeking independence to galaxy conquerors. The Abh have military and economic dominion over the United Mankind. Now, in an ironic move, mankind seeks freedom and independence from those that wanted their independence. Despite this seeming like a good start for a story, the anime does not focus on the huge war taking place. The effects and some small fighting moments are shown, but they are not the main story. Instead, it takes a more personal look at two characters caught up in this war: Jinto and Lafiel.\n\nJinto is a young boy who is the son of the Hyde star system's president. His father, Rock Lin, made a shady deal as their world was taken over by the Abh: rather than fight the invaders, he opted to become the territorial lord. This by effect made Jinto Abh nobility. Seven years after this event, he is on his way to a military college in the Abh's capital where he meets Lafiel. Lafiel also carries social influence - born in the Abriel family, she is a princess and the granddaughter of the Abh's empress. She currently works as a flying trainee trying to work her way up in the military. The anime follows the two trying to reach their destination only to be sidetracked by the war taking place - their tale turns from one of an escort mission to that of survival.\n\nTheir personalities, as you would expect, are quite different from another. Jinto is more relaxed and calm, while Lafiel is serious and straightforward. The two protagonists form an interesting dynamic with each other. Due to her military experience, Lafiel is sharp when it comes to controlling ships or coming up with a strategic plan. Jinto is more aware of social cues and is able to help them keep a low profile in enemy territory or ease a tense situation. With personality traits like these, they have good chemistry with each other (that also hints at a bit of romance). The moments where they are alone and discuss what to do next are some of the better moments in the series. The talk may be a bit more formal, but their conversations always have a friendly delivery with each other that feels natural for them. Had this show been a character study in a more low-key setting, it would make for a great series.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not the case. Crest of the Stars still seeks to be a space opera full of grand bombast and wonder despite focusing mainly on two characters. Mixed between the relationship of Jinto and Lafiel are battle scenes and side characters that ultimately fall flat. This is due to not enough time being put on these elements. A show can't achieve a full complex environment in only 13 episodes and still spend a majority of its time on its two leads - some elements will have to be cut. This results in many of the dire circumstances feeling like \"misadventures\", such as when they are \"held captive\" by the Baron Klowal. Rather than fear for our heroes, I was ultimately watching as to when they will escape because of the lack of tension. The battles that Laimsairh and Spoor, two of the Abh ship leaders in the war, are involved in have no weight because we hardly know the opponent they're fighting. Additionally, because they interact so sparingly with the main two, it feels like episode fluff rather than seeing a smart or flashy military battle. Crest of the Stars wants to be a space opera but in reality is a romanticized adventure.\n\nCharacter wise, Lafiel is fine due to her straight shooter attitude, but Jinto can be a bit questionable at times. I at first (and still mostly do) found him to be a breath of fresh air in terms of a lead. He's not the manliest guy, but he doesn't overreact or make a big deal of the scene around him, making him more human than cartoon. This goes a bit too far in situations where there IS something to worry about - in other words, he underreacts. In scenes where death should be lurking around his corner, he is strangely calm and makes lighthearted remarks. I can give him the benefit of the doubt and say he's near fearless, but his relaxed attitude makes it so any scene wanting to be intense feels deflated. The other characters are eclipsed by these two, so characters that could be interesting like the ones in Marca's group or Laimsairh are sadly sidelined. \n\nIn more general terms, the Abhs and mankind are also characters that can be faulted, but this is more of the way the show presents them instead of who they actually are. Some stories have very simple sides to choose (heroes vs. villains) while other stories like to show each side has mixed morals and ultimately either side is right in their means. Crest of the Stars wants to do both, trying to throw cries of independence and goodwill at both sides while making the humans have a more negative appearance (lying, violent propaganda) while the Abhs have a more positive appearance (graceful appearance, gentle yet firm speech). If this were a political piece, surely the audience would lambast this as strawmanning. Even the narrator's opening shifts sides, starting with an overview of the world before telling twisted tales of the Good Samaritan to bolster the Abhs. Though there's an argument for this show being imperial propaganda, I don't think it's as much imperial propaganda as much as it is bad directing/storytelling. It's much easier to write simple sides than to give each side its own reason for being good. Even shows like LoGH fall victim to this, albeit they do it in much less of a \"kneejerk\" way. Again, a lesser scope or more episodes can avoid this. Sadly, this is the end result.\n\nThese last two issues are not as dire as the first (to me, it's worse to be not invested in a show than anything else), but are still some faults of the show. Of course, all of these faults could ultimately be due to the adaptation. The novels the anime was based on won a Seiun Award, an honor given to the best Japanese science fiction works of the year. The novels may carry more detail than what the anime can show, so perhaps it needed 2 cours to fully show off its potential. \n\nVisually, the animation is fine. It can come off as a bit on the budget side at times, but it looks decent in motion (especially in the faster paced-scenes). Adding to this is the good use of multi-tone shading, an older tradition that looks as great now as it did then. The character models can look a bit strange at times, with an odd curve in their skull (this is most apparent in Seelnay's appearance) but it stays consistent and there's really no off-models with the look. The soundtrack is very good, with big string sections and pleasant tracks giving the right mood to each scene. The ED, \"Ushinawareta Aozora\", is a catchy, nostalgic sounding sing-along and works great alongside the pictures of the two protagonists growing up. The voice acting is fine for what the show gives us - it's a formal setting, so formal voices are to be expected. A bit more passion from Jinto would and a slightly less annoying voice for Seelnay would be preferred, but they all do a good job playing their roles.\n\nOverall, I give Crest of the Stars a 5.5 out of 10. The truth is that Crest of the Stars cannot do anything Legend of the Galactic Heroes does better in the space opera genre. A show like LoGH covers a wider and more detailed look at politics, tactics and human behavior than Crest of the Stars does, even within its first 13 episodes. A made-up language and fancy names can only distract a viewer so long. Crest of the Stars might be liked if you want something more romantic, but otherwise I would avoid unless you are an avid fan of the genre tags.\n\nDo you like or dislike this anime?

But there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one fear that people often overlook, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one that can completely consume your life\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The fear of absolute solitude. Not having a past, not having a future, just being alone, with nobody to look out for you but yourself. For some people, this wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be so bad\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 After all, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been said, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no feeling freer than having nothing left to lose. But to Nono, a spunky girl surviving by the skin of her teeth on the planet Mars, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing cool or ideal about it. Having spent an unknown and potentially unfathomable amount of years living on her own, traveling the expansive red desert without a home to go back to, without any memories to tell her who she is, or any future to look forward to, the only comfort she has in the middle of the night is her head full of dreams, and her ambition to one day become a famous pilot and save humanity from the insidious alien threat!\n\nHowever, like most people in modern day times, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only able to live out her dreams through fantasy while working a dead-end job for wages that she can just barely survive off of. Working in a diner that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s populated mainly by truckers and washed-up space pilots, her dreams of outer space adventures are the only thing saving her from the looming threat of assault from her patrons. Thankfully, when that threat becomes fully realized, so does her dream! An ace mecha pilot from the elite interstellar military known as Fraternity, who is ironically female, crash lands right in the middle of the diner, saving her(whether intentionally or not) and unknowingly offering her the once-in-a-lifetime chance to hitch a ride into space and live out her dreams! Well, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what she wants to do, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a catch; The pilots of Fraternity are called Topless, not because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re shameless exhibitionists, but because they have some sort of ESP power, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no lid on their minds to hold in their powers. Yeah, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stretching it, but hey YOU try to explain why they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re called that. Nono, who is revealed to be a robot, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have this ability, but as it turns out, she might just have potential far exceeding those who can.\n\nIn 2004, Studio Gainax released two anime to commemorate their 20 year anniversary; One of them was This Ugly Yet Beautiful World, a full-length TV series that massively disappointed, and Aim for the Top Diebuster, the sequel to their debut OVA Aim for the Top Gunbuster, and it only takes a cursory glance at both shows to figure out which one got the most attention from the production team. This Ugly was going to be an easy, dumb title full of nudity, so they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to waste too much money to make it successful\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Diebuster, however, was going to be a sequel to a 20 year old anime that had a massive army of loyal and highly protective fans behind it, was much more of a risk, and in light of this, the amount of money they poured into this title is immediately apparent upon the first few minutes of the first episode. I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen every single Studio Gainax anime\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Give it a few more years, I definitely will be able to brag about this at some point\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but from what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen, Diebuster is by far the best looking anime I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen from them. Yes, that includes Evangelion, at least by a little.\n\nTo be fair, at least in terms of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s characters, Diebuster is on the more cartoony side of the scale. Honestly, they look more like Fooly Cooly characters than Gunbuster characters, which I guess is just the look the company was pushing back then. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a huge step away from Gunbuster, but I think there are a few reasons it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth forgiving. First of all, the most colorful and cartoony character IS the sunny, happy-go-lucky robot girl, which allows the distinction to make a small bit of sense. Everyone else, even those with alternate skin and hair color options, look far more down to earth, and the few who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t are given so little screen time it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really matter. Second, the outdated character designs of 1984 wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mesh at all with the beautifully drawn and exquisitely detailed backgrounds they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be placed in. Before the first appearance of the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s title in the first episode, I was already on Facebook gushing about how gorgeous it looked. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a single shot in Diebuster that I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to watch on loop so I could fantasize about living in it, save for maybe the scarier war scenes.\n\nThere are so many layers on screen at any given time that you almost don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know where to look\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The characters aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always in the foreground, because sometimes that space will be reserved for lens flares, or a small cross section of whatever they happen standing in front of. After that, depending on the environment, the remaining layers can be used to show an entire world of activity in the background of outer space, or the crushing loneliness of an open plain. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not impossible for an anime to look as alive and immersive as Diebuster does, but it is rare, and I want to think this is the only time Gainax has ever pulled it off. The use of lighting also helps, seeing how once we leave Mars in episode 1, the bulk of what we see from there on is shrouded in shadow, which perfectly complements the bright and bouncy Nono, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s childish antics and outgoing personality are quite literally designed to shine in the darkness, both in terms of the artwork and in terms of the bleak tone of the story. The immersive background also helps distract you during those rare moments when the animation maybe isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as fluid as it is elsewhere, which is already a sparse problem.\n\nThe CG is also used to perfection here, and it pops up frequently, in all sorts of background and foreground layers. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not just going to be impressed by the fleets of ships that the Fraternity owns, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be impressed by vast expanses of space they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re existing in. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve praised several anime in the past for having beautiful looking paintings represent space, but in Diebuster, space is ever moving and ever evolving like an organism all it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own. In shots that combine layers of CG with layers of traditional animation, it looks freaking unbelievable. The same can be said for weather effects and the way they visually affect the characters on-screen, as well as lazers, light beams and any other special effects the script may call for. You could almost call this a spiritual predecessor to Gurren Lagann, if it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t also surpass that series. Characters, whether in action or idling between missions, are animated perfectly, with a wide and very graceful range of motion, capped off by fully expressive and photogenic faces. Gainax has never been the best company when it came to managing budget issues, so for Diebuster, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to assume they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t HAVE any budget issues, and whether or not that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the case, it worked out amazingly for them.\n\nWhile Kohei Tanaka is not a name you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d generally hear associated with Gainax\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Honestly, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s much more well known to the One Piece crowd, although I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a much bigger fan of his work on Bastard\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 He did compose the score for two of Gainax\u00e2\u0080\u0099s projects, those being both Gunbuster and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sequel, Diebuster. This is probably why there are so many Gunbuster songs that wound up being reused in Diebuster, and in some surprisingly smart and subtle ways. I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a huge fan of the first season\u00e2\u0080\u0099s OST, but the tunes that are shared by both shows are used much better this time around. Tanaka is generally known for his grand, sweeping ballads, but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also known for using rock and roll and electric tracks in order to rack up the intensity of a fight scene. Honestly, though, the music in this show isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly memorable\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 You won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be humming along to any of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tracks on the way to work\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But they work splendidly in the moment, and you will enjoy them when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching the show.\n\nThe opening, Groovin\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Magic, is far more memorable, and I challenge you not to get it stuck in your head. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s received some criticism on two different fronts, with one saying that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a piece of Jpop fluff, and the other saying it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a mish-mash of clips from the show. To the second I say, have you never watched a Gainax show before? They do that all the time. Most of Gainax\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anime properties have openings that use original animation to bookend long slots of random out-of-context clips. Diebuster does this too, and while the original animation basically consists of silhouetted characters walking, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a lot of fun to watch. The song has a sort of light, funky sixties pop feel to it, which was a great choice considering what kind of person the main character is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Nono is an idealistic dreamer, a sunny flower child who brings ideals of pacifism and humane priorities to a war zone full of cynics and jaded veterans, challenging the way they think. this is very much her theme song, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say the ending theme doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t also resonate with her. It does, but it runs a little deeper, to the darker feelings she keeps hidden from everyone, as well as her firm resolve to put on a smile for their sake. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great soundtrack overall, and a huge improvement over that of the first season.\n\nActually, as it turns out, improvements upon the first show can be found all over the place in this one. Now, I originally thought Gunbuster was okay, a good show overall, if not problematic in a lot of areas. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s characters were weakened by it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s insistence on setting aside time it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to spare for the sake of explaining things we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to know, showing us things we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to see, and exploring several dead end plot points that wound up adding nothing to the important areas of the story. As a result, thing got overly complicated, and we sacrificed any depth the main characters or the badly explained one-note villains could have had in exchange for footnotes like \u00e2\u0080\u009cdolphins with helmets were connected to the development of extrasensory perception.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It probably wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair of me to blast it for being outdone by a later series, particularly in the area of developing it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main character, but I stand by my belief that newer anime can be both superior products and useful comparative tools to older anime, and since Gainax already improved upon several elements of their inaugural series through Evangelion, they had a golden opportunity to seal the deal with their 20th anniversary piece.\n\nThere really aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very many ways to connect Diebuster to Gunbuster as a canon sequel, although they apparently exist in the same universe with a massive time gap in-between, so it works a lot better to consider this series as a reimagining of an older concept. And yes, Diebuster features a vast improvement in terms of narrative and execution. On the surface, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story is very simple. It follows an innocent and untainted main character getting the opportunity to live out her dreams, struggling, and ultimately becoming more than the sum of her parts through unexpected and unorthodox means, while changing the people around her in the process. There are little to no deviations from her journey, and the fact that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s her journey above all else is never in question. Everything that happens in the series is either related directly to her, or directly related to the Fraternity group and surrounding characters in ways that will affect her down the line By using this much tighter sense of focus, Gainax is able to explain the plot and setting to us through her, as we learn what she learned, while at the same time getting us invested in her story. With Nono performing this role, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little to no need for exposition, although Gainax still crowbars it in with their subtitles.\n\nUnfortunately, Diebuster isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so much an improvement as it is the exact opposite of Gunbuster in terms of strengths and weaknesses. Whereas Gunbuster spent a lot of time telling you very little, Diebuster sounds way too little time telling us way too much. There wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very much happening in Gunbuster that was very important, which made it feel a little boring, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way too much important shit going on in Diebuster, making it feel way too overwhelming and confusing at times. To be fair, this doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually start happening until episode 4, as I think everything was paced really nicely up until that point. Past episode 4, however, the story and plot become extremely difficult to follow, with important revelations being dropped like hot potatoes, new characters being introduced just to be killed off after mere seconds worth of collective screentime, which is apparently supposed to feel tragic, but I had to watch episode 4 three times just to catch what that tragedy even was, let alone why all the remaining Topless were lying in hospital beds with protective headgear on. It made sense when I was finally able to wrap my head around it, and the scenario I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been missing was even written better than I thought, but that still doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t excuse such shoddy pacing.\n\nBut that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all fine, because the characters get appropriate time devoted to their arcs and individual developmental journeys. Well, I say that, but just because time\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being devoted to them doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re being shown is going to hold up. As much as I loved her, and she is an incredibly fun and likeable character, Nono is kind of a Mary-Sue. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some subtle depth to her, when you compare her lonely past on Mars to her refusal to compromise her principals in Fraternity, but most of the time it barely resonates with her character in any meaningful way, and after spending half the series as an upbeat Lego brick, her transformation into Jesus happens on a dime. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too perfect, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always right, and when you get right down to it, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 well, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Robin Williams. I shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be too upset about that, as her perfect nature was an integral part of episode 3, which was so perfect it made me cry, but that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t her episode\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It was the episode of another pilot named Tycho Science(real name, not joking), who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s backstory and resolution are without question the most memorable thing about this story. And she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even manage to make an impact beyond that episode.\n\nWhich leaves the final main character, L\u00e2\u0080\u0099Arc Mellik Mai, who is probably the best one in terms of development. She starts out the series as a battle-hardened, no-nonsense warrior, the top of her class and the undisputed lord of the kill count. Meeting Nono gradually warms her heart and forces her to open up over time, resulting in her becoming more expressive as well as a few other spoilers. But I honestly can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but feel that she got a bit too much screen time. for a relationship between two characters to feel strong, it has to become strained at some point so it can mend and become stronger than before, which does happen in Diebuster between her and Nono\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 In what has to be the worst way possible. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to spoil this, so skip to the next paragraph if you really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to know how this all falls apart. Basically, she catches a pilot she has a thing for attempting to rape Nono, and her first words are \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy not me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Which\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I just\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 no. She turns her back on both of them, because how DARE he try to rape another, and how dare she BE that other, and oh dear God I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to vomit.\n\nI know I spent a lot of space talking about Diebuster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flaws, but it really is a fun show. Much like the first season, a lot of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best qualities can be found in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s space battles, and in this season, none of them ever feel wasted or pointless. We know what the goal of every fight is, we know what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at stake, and when the enemy suddenly becomes unimaginably strong, we know how and why it happened. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a sense of progression on both sides, with the humans discovering new technology, and the bugs becoming immeasurably powerful just when we think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re about to overcome them, even though what they are and why they want to kill us still hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been established. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot less fanservice than in the first season, as instead of bathing scenes forced in for no reason, everything that happens in this series\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 nudity included\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Serves a strict narrative purpose, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Nono being cleaned after being rescued from Mars or characters contemplating their issues while alone in the bath, and even then, everything\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shot tastefully\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Not to censor, but at the same time, not to exploit. Even the early shot of Nono ripping off the chest of her shirt was meant to be an homage to the first season, which Diebuster does clearly have a lot of respect for, even if it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look like it at times.\n\nAim for the Top: Diebuster! is available from Eastern Star Studios, which\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Like a star\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Is a bright spot in an expansive empty space of no fucking releases. This DVD set came out stateside nine years after the series came out proper, and after only three years since, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so far out of print that you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually get it on Amazon. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cheap enough on Ebay, as I got my copy for about twenty-five dollars, but yeah, I have no idea why it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been so sparsely released. An anime film, Gunbuster vs. Diebuster, is much easier to find, as it was released more recently. A single volume manga that ran in the magazine Dragon Age Pure is not available stateside.\n\nSo, how does Studio Gainax\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 20th anniversary OVA series hold up? Well, considering their other offering was a collaboration with Madhouse that brought little other than pretentious ramblings and barrels of bare boobies to the table, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say this one turned out rather nicely. It has surprisingly little to do with the original Gunbuster aside from some terminology and the visual of a robot running on a treadmill\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d nitpick, but considering that she also eats, sleeps and has a heart, sure, why not\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It actually feels a lot more like a few other Gainax properties. I already made the comparison to FLCL, in regard to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s colorful and cartoony character designs and over-all artistic aesthetic, but it also incorporates a lot of Evangelion, especially in the way that the pilots interact with each other. Oddly enough, though, it kind of also feels a lot like Gurren Lagann, which wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come out until three years later. I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go too specific, but it even ends with the imagery of a drill! So yeah, it works way better as a representation of what Gainax was between the late nineties and the mid-oughts than it does as a direct sequel. Much like Gunbuster, it has a lot of problems, but over-all, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pretty fun experience. I give Diebuster a 6/10. "}, {"id": 3330, "score": 60, "body": "Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 A title I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to shorten from this point on\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Is a show about two angels who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been expelled from heaven, and must destroy ghosts in order to be accepted back through the pearly gates. They follow the lead of a mysterious black priest named Garterbelt, who shelters them, manages them, and aids them in finding their targets. However, now that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re living new lives as mortals, what will be more important to them\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Their quest to return to their old home, or the vices and sinful pleasures of their new home?Our central character is Panty Anarchy, the older of the two sisters. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obsessed with sex, and has become addicted to the feeling of human intercourse. Her weapon, appropriately, is a pair of panties that can turn into an angelic gun. Her little sister is Stocking Anarchy, a gothic lolita girl who has become obsessed with sugary sweets, which she consumes almost as voraciously as Panty consumes men. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re both greedy, selfish, arrogant, and basically the exact opposite of how you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d expect an angel to act.\n\nThey have a dog named Chuck, who is constantly abused, thereby justifying his existence. They also obtain a sidekick named Brief, an introverted virgin boy who acts as the group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moral center, to absolutely no avail. Their manager, Garterbelt, is a priest, and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Do I really need to explain him any further than that?\n\nTheir archenemies, Scanty and Kneesock, are a pair of demonic sisters, who oddly act like the exact opposite of our heroes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Stuck up, reserved, dignified, but just as selfish and arrogant.\n\nSo, hearing this plot description, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re probably thinking that a bunch of bored, overworked middle-aged men must have come up with this scenario via committee while drunk off their asses. And if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking that, well\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yes. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly what this is, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly what happened.\n\nThe Gainax team took a well deserved vacation after they wrapped their work on Gurren Lagann, during which they all came up with this gem while drinking together. The plot, the characters, and almost every other detail was cooked up by people too wasted to cook, and yes, that includes the art style and tone.\n\nLike all alcohol fuelled get-togethers, the conversation inevitably diverted towards dirty jokes and adult humor, which they of course decided would be the focus of the show. They committed themselves to it, and if nothing else, you have to admire their tenacity. Panty and Stocking is vulgar all the way through, containing more fucks and shits than any televised show could be expected to have. They used these words in English to get them past the Japanese censors, but even without the foul language, there are entire episodes devoted to sex, bodily fluids, and often both.\n\nAs for those of you who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gotten this far into the review while thinking the material may be tastefully done, think again\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Taste, as it turns out, is the one word that seems to have been banned from the script. Unless of course Panty\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complaining that her food would taste better with some jizz on it.\n\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an episode where they fight a shit ghost\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 One where they fight a puke ghost\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a nose picking ghost who they have to fight with their nosebleeds\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And yet the only episode that ever offended me was the one where they have to fight a platoon of sperm ghosts who died storming the beaches of vaginal Normandy. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t blame me for being offended, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I have a Grandpa who fought in that war.\n\nThe problem with this approach isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the fact that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s offensive\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t funny. The humor relies entirely on shocking you, but it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take long for that shock to wear off, and the content on screen to become\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, dull, if you can believe it. And the actual writing is bare bones and lazy at best. Seriously, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the basic formula: Panty and Stocking act lazy, Garterbelt tells them about a mission, the girls cram their one-note-joke personalities down your throats until they start to run on fumes, end with a victory that rarely ever feels like an adequate pay-off. That shock value is really the only thing it has to try and keep you engaged with.\n\nWell, almost. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also the art style, which is based primarily on the work of Genndy Tartakovsky. Like Powerpuff Girls and Samurai Jack, this style includes thick outlines, bright colors, consistent angles, and character designs that could almost trick you into thinking it was flash animated. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the only western property that Panty and Stocking touches on\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The references to western culture are constant and merciless, with America as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favorite plaything. There are entire episodes playing around with Romero movies, Michael Bay\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Transformers reboot, and even a late nod towards X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Episode titles will be puns on American movies, even when the episode itself has nothing to do with said movie.\n\nFor an anime that tries it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s damnedest to inspire cries of \u00e2\u0080\u0098What the Fuck,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the only WTF question it really deserves to be asked is \u00e2\u0080\u0098Why the Fuck?\u00e2\u0080\u009d It isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so much \u00e2\u0080\u0098What the Fuck are they doing, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0098Why the Fuck are They Doing It?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 As well as, \u00e2\u0080\u0098What the Fuck Were They Trying to Accomplish?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And the answer, I believe, comes back to Excel Saga.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to believe one of those Gainax executives was an Excel Saga fan. Because this show reeks of Excel Saga.\n\nSeriously, take a look at the similarities. You have two eccentric heroines, a blonde-haired extrovert and a blue-haired introvert with larger breasts and health issues (Excel and Hyatt) who work for a mysterious individual who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s constantly assigning them bizarre missions (Il Palazzo), and they have an abnormal dog who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always in constant danger (Menchi, although he looks like Gir), and they eventually take on a third member who has trouble fitting in with them as they consistently get abused\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And come from a surprisingly affluent background\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 (El Gala, for those of you who read the manga). And they have to battle an opposing syndicate lead by a corrupt politician(OH FUCKING COME ON!). The difference is that instead of being well-meaning girls who are out to conquer the city, we have self-serving girls who are out to save the city.\n\nHowever, this blatantly obvious\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Um, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just call it an influence\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always a bad thing. I may criticize it for probably stealing it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basic plot structure from Excel Saga, but if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one thing I can give it credit for, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for successfully stealing it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bold, experimental tone as well. Excel Saga was a blank slate anime that used every episode to do something entirely different, depending on the whims of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s creators. It would drive it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unique characters through absurd situations on some days, and lampoon the crap out of other series/genres on the other days. Panty and Stocking is the only anime I can think of that was able to steal this tone, and make it their own.\n\nAs I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve mentioned before, I have no ear for Anime music. But I loved this anime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s music. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of electronic music in this title, and while I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know enough about electronic music to describe it very well\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 like at all\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I can say that I found it very enjoyable. Even the autotuned tracks\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And there are many\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Are ridiculously catchy. But the highlight, for me, was the ending theme, an entirely english song called Fallen Angel. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll let the song speak for itself, but I honestly can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see any other song working as well when placed in the background of an ending video that features chibi bobbleheads in a number of perilous situations. The result is just\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Adorkable. A word I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even like.\n\nAnd then, we have the English dub. Good lord, do we have the English dub.\n\nThe English dub takes the vulgarity of the series, as well as the pop culture references, and cranks them up to eleven. And after hearing how much Jamie Marchi enjoys reading her extra-perverse lines, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take a rocket scientist to figure out that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the one who wrote the damn thing. Mostly.\n\nAs much as I love Jamie Marchi as an actor\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 For the record, I think the majority of her performances are fun and full of life\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never liked her as a script writer. I think she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of those rare writers whose quality declines if she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s given too much freedom with it. I already talked about her in my Yamada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s First Time review, calling her one of the try-hardiest writers in the anime genre. With the amount of dirty jokes and movie quotes she managed to jam into this dub, I can imagine her primary writing tool being not a pen, but a crowbar. Although the Engrish swearing in the sub was pretty damn funny, I only laughed about a dozen times while watching the dub\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Which consists of thirteen episodes.\n\nThe casting is perfect, the actors do their best, but in the end, no amount of sincerity can make this dialogue sound like anything other than suppressed writers laughing at their own jokes. You simply can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t save writing that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this bad.\n\nAll vulgarity and no wit makes Panty and Stocking a dull boy.\n\nOh, while we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on the subject of the dub, this one kills me as a voice-chaser, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a prime example of Cherami Leigh mimicking Luci Christian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice.\n\nWhile I fail to appreciate this anime as a comedy, I actually really respect it from an artistic perspective, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not just talking about the addictive art and animation style. By following Excel Saga\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experimental example, Panty and Stocking makes room for some surprisingly bold artistic decisions. The art style becomes hyper-realistic during the puke episode, a brief change that will leave many first time viewers wondering if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve wandered into a different show. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an entire episode done in one continuous shot, save for some time skips. And my favorite episode of all is Chuck to the Future, an episode where the dog Chuck goes through what can only be called a David Lynch movie, told through barely any dialogue, as he battles his arch-nemesis Fastener. And since they had time left over after this segment, the writers just said \u00e2\u0080\u009cFuck it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and did a music video that parodies a huge chunk of the western popular music scene.\n\nBut that loose style also carries a huge drawback. The thing I hate the most about this show is that it knows how plotless and irrelevant it is, and by coating itself in a thick shell of non-existent fucks, it safeguards itself from criticism. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ask why the writing is so bad, because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Panty and Stocking. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ask why there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so much about it that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make any sense, because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Panty and Stocking. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bring up any arguments about consistency, logic, continuity, or character development because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fucking Panty and Stocking!\n\nOne of the creators has cited Drawn Together(and other adult cartoons) as a primary inspiration for the vulgarity and overall tone this show, but considering how little fucks it gives about it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own presentation and structure, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be a little quicker to finger Tom Green as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spiritual predecessor. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try to give us anything more than whatever the fuck it wants to give us, and in doing so, it can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t possibly fail. And in a weird way, as much I hate this, I can actually kind of respect it.\n\nOh, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also an eight minute OVA called Sanitarybox, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entirely pointless, and if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to think about discarded foreskins every time you eat a Funion, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even bother with it.\n\nOverall, Panty and Stocking will be different things to different people. Some of us will find it hilarious, some of us will find it an intriguing art piece, and some of us will just roll our eyes and be alienated the entire time. As far as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m concerned, these are all valid reactions to one of the most original anime shows to come out in the last decade. It looks great, despite it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best efforts, and it sounds great, also despite it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best efforts, and even if you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t call it enjoyable, if nothing else, you can at least call it unforgettable.\n\nI give Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt a 6/10.\n"}, {"id": 3335, "score": 60, "body": "This story takes place in the distant future, when mutants and demons slither through a world of darkness. Mankind has not yet disappeared from this world, but surviving in it has become a struggle, with some ancient war, lost to time save for it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s place in myths and legends, having rendered the world as we know it into a vast, unforgiving wasteland. The few communities that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve managed to form have been cobbled together from different points in human cultural history, with stone buildings, clothing from both Victorian and Wild West sensibilities, and technology that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t technically available until far later. Conditions are livable, at the very least, but the worst of all is the fact that despite the measures we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve concocted to battle the various demons and mutants that stalk our crops, livestock and children, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve fallen under the mercy of the Nobility, a class of ancient vampires who live out their eternal lives in their castles, allowing us to live our pathetically fragile and ephemeral lives more out of amusement than anything else.\n\nOne such vampire, the cruel Count Magnus Lee, has become bored with his immortality, and after what is rumored to be somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 years of life, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taken to finding \u00e2\u0080\u0098distractions\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to help him pass the meaningless years. By distractions, of course, I mean human women, untainted, unturned, cast into unbreakable trances so that he can marry them, break them and ravish their mortal bodies on a nightly basis. His newest obsession, orphaned farm owner Doris Lang, won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go down without a fight. Even after he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s marked his territory with a quick nibble at her nubile neck, this tough ginger has recruited a mysterious drifter, the silent Vampire Hunter known only as D, to protect her from harm and bring about an end to the nobility, whom he insists on referring to as transient guests. Thus the fight is on between an accomplished supernatural slayer and one of the most powerful opponents he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ever faced as D, half vampire in his own right, once again finds himself in a battle to protect one half of his geneology from the other.\n\nIf Vampire Hunter D\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visual aspects look dated in any way, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because this particular anime film\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 OVA? Film? I see different sites claiming both. Anyway, it was released in 1985, which was a far different time than the current anime landscape. I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go into too much detail about the way anime styles have evolved over the years, as that would be another full length discussion entirely, but suffice to say I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fair to judge an anime based on the restrictions of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s age, especially since the spectrum of quality was just as diverse then as it is now. By the standards of 1985, this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m gonna call it a movie\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite the most beautiful material available at the time, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still firmly on the high end of the spectrum, with a clearly generous budget and a sense of restraint about how and when to use said budget\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 For the most part. Yeah, they could have saved a significant amount if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d skipped the oh so important shot of parting blades of grass that the film opens up on.\n\nWell, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a minor nitpick\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some filler from a visual standpoint, but it still looks gorgeous anyway. Production Reed, formerly known as Ashi Productions, is an animation studio that did the majority of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work in the eighties and nineties before taking a handful of long hiatuses in the new millennium. Aside from Vampire Hunter D, very little of what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve worked on has managed to stay out of obscurity, with a few examples being Blue Seed and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, Vampire Hunter.  Seriously, who remembers Minky Momo? And if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m being honest, what little I have seen of their production history points to D as being a rare standout. The movements aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always fluid, but they rarely ever feel cheap or stilted either, and out of the many action scenes that this movie has been packed with, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember a single one of them looking bad. There are some corners cut, but none that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll really notice, save for one particular moment where certain characters are getting captured, and some of the most obvious speedlines are employed. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s jarring but brief, thankfully.\n\nDespite being dated, the animation did actually hold up nicely in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original DVD release, but it was also very recently released on bluray, and the difference in quality is more noticeable in some scenes than others, including a walk through an ancient battlefield that I always found way too dark, and now we can see the details in the bones and debris a lot more clearly. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m also pleased to note that the cleaned up presentation hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t altered the dirtier elements of the design, namely the desperate old west setting full of makeshift clothes, arid desert and a town full of people who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve spent their entire lives performing physical labor to get by. It has, however, provided the opportunity for the designs more gothic elements to shine through in all their beauty. Part of what makes this series so iconic is the blend of gothic, sci-fi and western elements, all of which play an equal role in the design of D as a badass hero, Doris as a tough beauty, and Lee as a villain who doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even have to move or speak to feel intimidating. The random mutants and monsters are also really cool and diverse, with the possible exception of a bland dinosaur looking creature in the beginning.\n\nThe soundtrack, composed by Noriyoshi Matsuura and Tetsuya Komuro, is a bit underwhelming, but there are a few memorable tracks here and there. D\u00e2\u0080\u0099s theme in particular, which plays at the end just before the credits roll, starts off with an intense action anthem before quickly settling into a more lonely, melodious tone, as if to tell the tale of a warrior whose exploits you may witness one day, but who endures years of uninterrupted travel that you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see once he rides off into the sunset, painting a more complete picture of the kind of life he leads and the kind of character he is than the movie ever properly establishes. Actually, D has three themes, and one of the other ones, that plays when he enters the film for the first time, is also pretty cool, with it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lighthearted tune undercut by a beat that warns of danger and tragedy i the future. I called the soundtrack underwhelming, but I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really mean to say it was bad\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 With the exception of D\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Themes, none of the tracks are really memorable, as they blend so flawlessly into the movie that they sound strange when dettached from it. They do their job well, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a bad thing by any means.\n\nAs for the dub\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 well, there are two dubs, one from Streamline pictures, and the other from just last year, done by Sentai Filmworks. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not gonna lie, when I was first getting into anime, and this was maybe the second anime movie I ever bought(right behind Cardcaptors movie 1), I almost never watched it in English, vastly preferring the Japanese track, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard a lot of people say the same. Descriptions of the original dub range from \u00e2\u0080\u0098It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tolerable\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to \u00e2\u0080\u0098Burn my freaking ears off,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and while the acting was decent for the time\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, for the most part, Doris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brother was an earsore\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The writing, in parts, was just terrible. For a quick example\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Trust me, this is not as bad as it gets\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a scene about halfway through the movie where a certain character who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just been turned into a vampire is looking at an old friend in a new light. In the Japanese, he says that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always thought of her as like a granddaughter to him, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now wondering why he never raped her. Honest, but creepy and abrasive, so a rewrite was in order. In the first dub, he replaces the second part with \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can tell now that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a beautiful young woman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nicer, but it feels neutered, almost too safe.\n\nIn the Sentai dub, however, the line is changed to \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut now that I see how beautiful she is, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a wonder I never violated that beauty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which is a line that retains the honesty of the original while still finding a much more tasteful way to word it. There are a lot of scenes that were able to find a touch more subtlety in the new Sentai dub, such as an early scene where Doris offers to sleep with D in payment for his work, in a later scene where the count\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter is weighing her fate against a recent revelation about her lineage, and one very specific scene where they originally dropped the worst possible Star Wars reference. Seriously, Doris says she loves D, who drops the fucking \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know\u00e2\u0080\u009d bomb on her. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not making that up. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a moment early in the film where Count Lee meets Doris for the first time, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supposed to be silent, but the Streamline dub chose to fill in the silence with an introduction stolen right out of classic Dracula, which doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sound that bad at first, but even on first listen, it just feels unnecessary. Sentai, on the other hand, left the atmosphere and ambience speak for itself.\n\nWhen it comes to the two primary characters, Doris Lang and the titular vampire himself, I feel like the performances were equally good in both dubs, despite different approaches that were taken. Both Michael McConnohie and John Gremillion bring a sense of strength and stoicism to the character of D, with the trade off being that while Gremillion plays him as more raspy and weary, playing more to his history of combat, while McConnohie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s steely, controlled delivery plays more to the character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s air of mystery. Also, McConnohie does double duty in playing D\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talking left hand, while another actor plays him entirely in the Sentai dub. Barbara Goodson and Luci Christian both play Doris as strong-willed and determined, with the main difference being that Goodson makes her sound older, making her constant fanservice and attraction to D far more palatable, while Christian plays her as much younger, sounding more like a teenager, which makes the threat of danger against her feel more palpable. Shannon Emmerick plays a much more likeable Dan than Lara Cody did, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also pretty cool.\n\nOne of the more obvious changes between the two dubs is the change in the nobility\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accents, with Count Lee and his daughter Larmica going from Romanian to British. There was really nothing wrong with Jeff Winkless\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance, Dracula inspired as it was, but with the incomparable David Wald taking his place, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easily outshined, as you can feel the millennia of boredom and almost casual malice much more richly in Wald\u00e2\u0080\u0099s throaty delivery. Unfortunately his daughter didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fare the change so well, as Edie Mirman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prideful, seductive performance almost feels mocked by Brittany Karbowski\u00e2\u0080\u0099s much brattier interpretation of the character. This could have worked, mind you, if Brittany didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t overcook her accent, sounding like a middle schooler who just saw her first Harry Potter movie. To be fair, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stated in the past that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well aware of the fact that pulling off accents is one of her weak points, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m tempted to blame the director on this one. Actually, to be honest, while the new dub is well acted and well written, it does feel poorly directed in a lot of areas. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend the Sentai dub between the two, but neither can touch the Japanese track.\n\nI think I was about 16 the first time I ever saw this movie, and it happened at a friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house as part of their birthday party celebration. I had never heard of it before then, outside of the fact that it was one of the many ridiculously overpriced M-rated anime that I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t old enough to buy at Mediaplay. I was still fairly innocent at the time, with my deepest knowledge of Anime revolving between what was airing on American TV and what I could find in manga form at the public library, and Vampire Hunter D blew me away as the first adult-oriented anime I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d ever seen. My fragile little mind was blown away not just by the ominous music and tone, or the dark, gothic design, but also by the graphic bloody violence and full-on nudity that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never seen from any other title prior. I bought the DVD soon afterwards, and I just about wore that poor disk out with my constant rewatches. Seriously, I still have that copy, and I can barely get it to play.\n\nTo this day, Vampire Hunter D is not just my favorite anime movie, but also one of my favorite movies of all time, but if you think that means I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to give it a gushing masterpiece review, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sadly mistaken. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned over my years of reviewing that you have to separate your personal and professional tastes in order to be fair, and to be fair, Vampire Hunter D is not very good. It holds up very well from a visual standpoint, but when it comes to the story and the writing, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really stand up to close scrutiny, which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sad to say is the case with most cult classics. For a brief overview of the plot, a young woman is facing the possibility of being abducted by a cruel lord of inhuman ancestry and questionable royal standing, so she hires a silent protagonist to retrieve her every time she gets taken. He must travel to the lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s castle, battling grotesque monsters, several mercenaries and the lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own children in order to get her back, only to have her get captured again immediately afterwards.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen people compare this movie to Castlevania\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never played it, so I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really speculate\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But personally, it feels a lot more like a Super Mario Brothers story to me. I mean, yeah, there are obvious differences\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Thank god D isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t followed by a green clad brother named L\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But just like the classic line of Mario games, it does get a little tiresome seeing a story\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lead female just getting traded back and forth between the hero and the villains like a volleyball. To be fair, the original books, including the first in the series, which this movie was based on, do have a lot more exposition and explanations given about all of the characters and the environment they cohabitate, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just the thing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 This movie isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a book, and that book isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t particularly easy to find outside of the internet, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more or less unlikely that anyone coming into this movie will have read the proper text beforehand, and by virtue of a movie being visual media, they shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so much more to this story than the movie gives us, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sorely lacking without it.\n\nRight from the beginning, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re given two sentences of dialogue to describe the world we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re about to be dropped into, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entirely possible to just take the movie at it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s word and not think about it, but considering the state the world is in in this story, with demons and dinosaurs existing alongside classic monsters like werewolves and vampires, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obviously a rich history behind it all, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s damn near criminal to leave all of it up to our imaginations. The history of the vampires\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Excuse me, the Nobility\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Is particularly important, because not only is their role in the history of Earth and human society never touched upon even once, but when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mentioned that Count Lee could be up to 10,000 years old, it leads to headache inducing questions about how long they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve existed, how long we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve known about them, why D keeps calling them transient guests, why half-vampire Dampiels are somehow stronger and better equipped to survive in the sunlight, and are exempt from that same transient label. The very few answers we get just wind up increasing the mountainous pile of questions that the book may or may not have addressed\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember, I read it thirteen years ago.\n\nWell, I do remember a few details that would have been nice for the movie to include, like the fact that four of the nameless monsters in the movie\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 A giant rock creature, an old hag, a flying S&M conehead and a hunchback full of spiders\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 All had names and identities at one point, and were all members of the mercenary Rey Ginsei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gang. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re reduced to glorified cameos in the movie, just a bunch of featured baddies to be mowed down. I also distinctly remember the three larmia sisters from under Lee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s castle having a backstory that got cut from the movie entirely. The interactions between Rey and Greco were also supposed to go on longer, with the two of them entering into a partnership as allies against D. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of pulp that got cut out of the story, including a hint to the relationship between Vampires and humans revolving around their weakness, and the list goes on, but even if you can forgive all of that, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a ton of stupid shit that happens in the story. I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go into all the little examples, but if you want to see them, I did an Inconvenient Questions post about this movie.\n\nSo if I have all of these problems with the movie, do I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bad movie? Well, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not very good, but no, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s necessarily bad, either. As rushed and poorly executed as the story may have been, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a story you can easily get sucked into, and the characters are compelling enough to get invested in without really knowing them as well as you should. The action and all the battles are still fun to watch, and the designs are still cool enough to hold your attention. Well, mine, at least. With the exception of D, who comes off as yet another example of every badass lone wolf wet dream that socially challenged emo kids have ever attached themselves to over the years if you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t learned more about his backstory and personality from the extended book universe, none of the other characters feel one note, they all have their own personalities and motivations. I found Larmica to be particularly compelling, but hey, even the annoying Greco had some depth to him. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just too bad this 80 minute film couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have added in about an extra half hour of material to flesh out it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s setting and characters better.\n\nVampire Hunter D was originally available on VHS and DVD from Urban Vision, but has been long out of print, at least until Sentai Filmworks rescued and rereleased it in 2015. I actually would recommend tracking down a copy of the original release, because unlike the more recent bluray release, it had a ton of special features in it, including trailers, interviews with the Japanese cast and a preview for the video game, which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve played\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for the PS1, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty terrible. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually based on the second movie, Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust, which is superior to the first in pretty much every way, and is based on the third novel in the series. The novels by Hideyuki Kikuchi, as well as a pretty decent manga series, are also available stateside. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a handful of art books, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re so inclined.\n\nWhile I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t entirely dismiss this movie as so many other critics before me have done, I can certainly acknowledge that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more junk food than most viewers realize. It does it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job as a gateway anime, drawing in less experiences otaku and younger viewers with it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dark tone and mature content, even if such content isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always presented in the most mature fashion. It survives in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market mainly as a right of passage for these fledgling otaku, especially once they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve broken away from the current releases and started to venture into more old school offerings, but that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t to say that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aged well, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obvious cool factor does little to make up for it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bare bones world building, rushed story and absurdly strenuous pace. If anything, it stands as a symbol of how badass vampires can be in Japanese pop culture(along with Hellsing, which had a lot of similar problems), and in a market where the noble undead have recently been used as harem and romantic comedy fodder, this distinction is still an important one, lending this film both credibility and relevance beyond it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s years. I give Vampire Hunter D a 6/10."}, {"id": 3336, "score": 50, "body": "Cross Academy was founded by the wealthy Kaien Cross to facilitate the idealized cohabitation of what would otherwise be considered predator and prey. Nestled away quiet and secluded in the woods, the students at this prestigious academy are segregated\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Er, I mean, separated\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Into two different classes. During the daylight hours, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find the classrooms occupied by humans, going about their peaceful school lives in a way that both their innocence and ignorance are protected. Swing by campus at night, however, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find those same classrooms filled with students of a more pale and toothy sort. This class is made up of vampires, most of which won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hesitate to taste your blood if you get too close to them.\n\nKeeping these two halves of the student body separate are Yuki Cross and Zero Kiryu, the former of whom was adopted by Kaien following a traumatic vampire attack when she was a child, and the latter having been taken in years later after a similar event. Together, they form the disciplinary committee, formed to keep their fellow students from crossing a line that should never be crossed. Unfortunately for them, Zero seems to have brought something back with him from his encounter as a child, as he slowly begins to turn into a vampire himself. As he loses control of his humanity, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up to Yuki, his only friend in the world, to ease his pain and keep him tied to humanity. Can she save her childhood friend from a fate worse than death, or will her mind be too clouded by her feelings for the mysterious Vampire dorm leader, Kaname Kuran?\n\nVampire Knight was animated by Studio Deen, a company that I praised heavily in my Irresponsible Captain Tylor review\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But that was nineties Studio Deen, which I almost feel is a completely different company from 2007 Studio Deen. The animation budget, as is the case with most modern Deen releases, was bare bones, and on-screen movement is noticeably cheap with very few exceptions. Characters freeze in the background like lifeless mannequins if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not the focus of the scene, and move only slightly in very robotic spurts when they are. Characters profiles bounce up and down to indicate walking, or in the few far shots, they walk or run like they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually exist in their own environment, with emotion only seeming to exist in their insanely detailed eyes.\n\nI can kind of tell by the angles, art design and often pretentious editing that Deen had a specific vision and visual tone in mind when they were making this show, but they just didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the experience or talent necessary to work with such a small budget. The backgrounds are decent, albeit somewhat generic and lifeless. The character designs are highly attractive by shoujo standards, with it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two male leads looking just debonair and hunky enough to tease the female viewers, and Yuki herself looking just enough like the wide-eyed, plain-yet-pretty protagonist that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d want to insert themselves into. There aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very many characters other than them, but the ones we do have look distinguishable enough to be passable.\n\nThe soundtrack is full dark gothic-sounding fare, blending somber piano, heart wrenching violin-work and a powerful greek choir to express the emotion of any given scene far better than the stiff looking characters can. Pipe organs are used in the main theme to create a sense of church-like foreboding, a fitting warning of the darker, more sinful paths the characters will inevitably travel. Composer Takefumi Haketa knows just when to use restraint and when to take over, grabbing your attention at all the right moments, and he also seems to know the characters themselves just well enough to give them appropriate themes to match their roles in the story. Yukis theme in particular actually had me choking up a bit the first time I heard it isolated. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very well-made soundtrack in general, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a really fun listen whether in or out of context.\n\nThe opening theme is called Futatsu no Kodou to Akai Tsumi by On/Off, and as far as the song goes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s awesome. It takes the same tone and style as the soundtrack and turns it fast and catchy without bastardizing it. The video, on the other hand\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Remember when I said the show occasionally uses pretentious editing? They go full tilt with it here. This single video crams in as much imagery as it can, somehow making time to go through that old clich\u00c3\u00a9 of having the camera pan past all the supporting characters in a single shot. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a busy op where there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way too much going on visually, which is why I kind of appreciate the much slower pace of the ending theme\u00e2\u0080\u0099s video a little more. Still Doll by Kanon Wakeshima is probably the best piece in the entire soundtrack, at least in terms of composition and singing talent alone.\n\nThe English dub, on the other hand, is ghastly. To start off on a positive note, there are two really good performances in this, with one of them of course coming from the celebrated VA Vic Mignona in the role of Zero, a character constantly going through some sort of physical or emotional turmoil, which Vic pulls off flawlessly. The other is by Laura Bailey, playing the role of the deliciously evil villain Maria, who sadly doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enter the story until episode 9. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s able to play both halves of her character in equally convincing fashions, and she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just do this by changing her voice\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 No, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re two completely different characters in one, which she handles like the pro she is.\n\nAll right, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rip this band-aid right off. In the role of Yuki Cross, we have Mela Lee, one of my least favorite voice actors ever. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more or less okay with her characters awkward or comedic scenes, but anywhere else, she alternates between sounding wooden and sounding like a deflating balloon. She also gets on a lot of viewers nerves by mispronouncing Kaname\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name with a distinct \u00e2\u0080\u0098meh\u00e2\u0080\u0099 at the end. But oh, speaking of Kaname, at least Yuki doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sound like a synthesized computer voice. You can partially blame this on the character, but good voice actors can make a character sound good even without inflections. Somebody like Crispin Freeman could have killed this role.\n\nThere are other assorted characters played by actors who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do a very bad job, but aside from Bryce Papenbrook as Hanabusa, Travis Willingham as Kaname\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best friend Toga and a delightful cameo appearance by Jamieson Price, they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get much in the way of screen time or lines. For the most part, their role in the story is to gush about how awesome Kaname is and dump exposition for the audience, and they do a serviceable job of it.\n\nThe dub was written to be extremely faithful to the source material, with the only changes made being in the interest of matching the on-screen lip flaps. Believe it or not, this was kind of a bad idea. The dialogue is very literal, with little to no subtlety in any of it. As much as I hate using Family Guy as an example of anything, do you remember the Handiquacks episode, where Meg, Chris and Peter are trying to write their pilot? The dialogue in Vampire Knight sounds closer to what Chris and Peter settled on than the far more engaging line that Meg suggested. Everything is blatant and explanatory, making the characters sound stilted and downright boring.\n\nThis is unusual for me, but I actually wish somebody had tweaked the dialogue to sound more flavorful\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not talking about crow-barring in slang terms or pop culture references, but it would have been nice to hear some double-talk and sly innuendos tying the thirst for blood to more basic impulses. Or at the very least, have the characters be a little more vague about their plans and motives so that the audience actually has something to think about. The only character who actually speaks with any subtlety or ambiguity is Maria, and Laura Bailey does have a lot of fun with this, but it only lasts for a single episode before her identity is revealed and she rejoins the rest of the cast in mediocrity\n\nThere are plenty of times in this season alone where two characters will have a conversation that goes along the lines of \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, remember that thing we both know about that the audience doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I do, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll explain it to you, for no other reason than just to prove it! Seriously! No other reason!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just when they manage to avoid the most cliched exposition set-up in anime history, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs you know\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rewrites are not a bad thing when done right, and Vampire Knight seriously needed one. If you need any more proof of this, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a scene in episode 9 where Zero gets scolded for not referring to a pure-blood with the proper honorific\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Despite the fact that the dub has no honorifics in it. Go ahead and listen to it if you really want to hear Vic and Laura chew the scenery, but otherwise, stick to the subs on this one.\n\nIf you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t notice from my plot summary, Vampire Knight follows what sounds\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 At least to me\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 like a flawed concept. Maybe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just thinking about this all wrong, but if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to encourage the peaceful cohabitation of humans and vampires\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Maybe you want to let the humans know about it at some point? Maybe you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d want them to go to school together, under close supervision, rather than holding the humans just out of reach like a tasty snack that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll want even more because they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have it? Because every time these two classes meet, the chance for danger is so high that they needed to implement a disciplinary committee. And hell, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like the sunlight kills the vamps. They just get sunburned\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Which somehow makes less sense than the whole sparkly thing.\n\nWhile I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t heard anybody make that complaint before, I have heard pretty much every other complaint this series receives. A lot of them are from Twilight haters claiming it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the anime answer to that sorry franchise, while a lot more of them criticize it on technical issues, or they just call it flat out boring. Yeah, this show doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a very good reputation. Even Watchmojo, a Youtube channel that considers Naruto and Pokemon to be two of the top ten best anime ever made, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even bother to include Vampire Knight on their top ten anime vampires list, despite Zero and Maria being pretty good candidates for it. So for everything that it does wrong, does it do anything right?\n\nQuite a few things, actually. Vampire Knight is a paranormal romance story through-and-through, belonging to the same genre as Twilight and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s various knockoffs. The point of these titles is to be a sexy, romantic escapist fantasy for women, although target age may differ. Vampire Knight is about as good as a paranormal romance can get, as it succeeds at a few basic elements that Twilight failed at. First of all, in regards to the main love triangle, you never have to wonder why those two paranormal dudes are after that bland, bitchy Bella chick. Zero and Yukis relationship leaves absolutely no question about why they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re so close or why there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so much unresolved tension between them, and while Kaname\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intentions aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t made clear until season 2, you can still tell at an early stage that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some substance to it beyond him just being a creeper. Also, I hate to say it, Vampire Knight is actually really sexy.\n\nAnd no, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not saying there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a ton of fanservice, exposed skin and big boobs. At best, Zero takes his shirt off a few times. The sexuality in this show is something far more subtle than that.\n\nSee, the school is divided between two classes. The night class, the vampires, are mature, introspective, experienced, and generally carry an air of superiority. The night class, made up of humans, come off as much younger in comparison, despite being physically the same age. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re naive, and they worship the night class, but interaction is forbidden\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The vampires can only drink blood from other vampires, while the humans are left to wonder what goes on in the other class, having no idea what the truth of it all is, and yes, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heavy temptation on both sides. The metaphor behind all of this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yes, Vampire Knight has a metaphor, close your jaws\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Is about sexuality. Vampires represent the sexually active, while humans represent the virginal. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why the opening song\u00e2\u0080\u0099s title translates to \u00e2\u0080\u009cTwo beating hearts and the crimson sin\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d The blood in your heart is the sin.\n\nNow, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to sexualize vampires, you have a very fine line you need to be careful not to cross. Vampire bites aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always consensual, and a series that handles itself poorly could become rapey as a result. Long time readers will remember me criticizing Diabolik Lovers for exactly that problem. Non-consensual biting does occur in Vampire Knight, but unless it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being used for tension, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s considered a bad thing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Zero is so ashamed after he bites Yuki for the first time that he begs her to kill him before he gets worse, and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t touch her again until she freely offers herself to him. Moments of tension between these two occur in a dimly lit bathroom, in the school pool, and in an empty part of the school where SHE LETS HIM BITE HER FROM BEHIND, turning the act of vampirism into an erotic sort of forbidden fruit.\n\nThis is why Vampire Knight resonates so strongly with it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s target audience. This is why people like myself, who are still as far away from that target audience as possible, can still find it so damned addictive. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s engaging not because of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s low-stakes plot or it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s terrible writing, but because of its sexuality. And even if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pick up on any of that, the main plot-line is still pretty interesting. Having one of your main characters struggling to resist becoming a vampire with every fiber of his being while a girl who cares about him tries her best to ease his pain while setting respectable boundaries is a concept you simply can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t screw up, and it makes borderline Mary-Sue Yuki into a much stronger character as a result.\n\nThis plot-line will make up for all the other boring or confusing stuff, leading you all the way to a cliff-hanger that will leave you salivating for a second season\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Which unfortunately exists. Yeah, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to talk too much about Vampire Knight Guilty, as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m only reviewing season one, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth noting that in my opinion, that season is just one long, consistent journey downhill. It brings fatalism into the arcs of our three main characters, rendering all of the choices they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d made throughout the series pointless and ending in a conclusion that would have pissed me off even if it was conclusive\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Which it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. But at least the first season makes you WANT a sequel, which is something.\n\nVampire Knight is available from Viz media. You can watch the entire series for free on their site, or if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather own the physical copy, you can find the DVD sets at a reasonable price both in stores and online. The second season, Guilty, can also be found the same way, or you can just buy all 26 episodes together. The original manga by Matsuri Hino is also available stateside from the same company, or just in old issues of Shoujo Beat. The live action musical is totally a thing that exists, and if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need subtitles, you can view the whole thing on Youtube.\n\nVampire Knight is everything a trashy paranormal romance should be. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s romantic, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sexual, it plays very sincerely with the concepts of forbidden love and loss of innocence, and it even manages to squeeze in some homoeroticism at the last minute without ever breaking from context or character. Having said that, good trash is still trash, and being a more serviceable version of Twilight still leaves a lot to be desired. I enjoyed it for what it was, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m likely to keep my DVD set despite the unfortunate festering growth that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attached to it. I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hold the second season\u00e2\u0080\u0099s failings against it, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 On it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own, I give Vampire Knight a surprisingly decent 5/10.  "}, {"id": 3338, "score": 60, "body": "The skies are pitched black, darkness has fallen across the land, and the only form of light comes from countless flames; always burning fiercely with no sign of dying down. Amid the blaze lies a figure shrouded in shadows, traversing the fires unfazed, unmoved. In their hand lies a small round figure, otherwise unrecognizable from the sheer dimness of the scene. They move closer to the flames. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a man. He is still covered in shadows, but a red light can be seen from his left eye. Before anymore can be perceived, the scene cuts to a city, with the camera panning across the metropolis. The city: Los Angeles, and despite the infinite amount of lights and vehicles in the area, it looks the opposite; dark and barren, almost lifeless.\n\nBlade Runner: Black Out 2022 is an animated short directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, as part of a three-short series detailing key events that take place between the original Blade Runner film, and the 2017 sequel, Blade Runner 2049. Black Out occurs three years after the first film, where the powerful Tyrell Corporation have manufactured and released \u00e2\u0080\u0098Series 8\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Replicants (androids), all purpose-built with a natural lifespan. However, the desire for autonomy rises amongst Replicants, leading to the Human Supremacy movement. Their aim: Find and kill these Replicants. Despite being artificial humans, the Replicants are the ones in danger and on the run, especially given that their identities are all registered for the public to find. The short specifically follows two Replicants, Iggy and Trixie, as they attempt to wipe out the registry. What entails is as action-packed and thoughtful as what you would expect from the Blade Runner franchise in a 15-minute short.\n\nThe original Blade Runner is considered one of the most influential science-fiction films ever made, delving into the implications of technology on the environment and society through the guise of an action plot on the surface. In Black Out, these implications are prominent here through the sheer imagery alone; the city of Los Angeles coming off more like a corporation than a city of people; it has control over atmosphere, giving this general sense of omnipresence and paranoia whenever the city is shown. This, along with a near complete absence of natural life makes the setting look more like a wasteland despite the obvious advances in technology present. The humans in Los Angeles are also shown to have no sense of care or empathy for Replicants at all, further emphasizing how the Replicants appear more relatable and \u00e2\u0080\u009chuman\u00e2\u0080\u009d than our own species. One of the humans working alongside Iggy and Trixie reflects on this, stating how humans are stupid and selfish creatures compared to Replicants. \n\nIdentity is another prime theme feature in Black Out in regard to Replicants in general. In one of Iggy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flashback, Replicants were shown to have been used as pawn soldiers to fight each other on opposing sides, identified through labels on the eye. Iggy intends to destroy this sense of purpose from his own identity by destroying the registry; the one thing that separates him from humans in the public eye. Trixie also wishes to be seen as a human, but in this short, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fighting her own little dilemma. She, like Pris from the original, were created purely for entertainment, highlighted here in the first scene Trixie appears in. This is further emphasized as her appearance then is strikingly similar to the doll she carries with her. It is not until later where she ditches the doll to fight alongside Iggy where she asserts herself as more than a lifeless toy. This defining moment could have used more time for better focus and overall progression, but it is a worthwhile attempt with a 15-minute duration. Her short exploration was to me, similar to Motoko Kusanagi from Ghost in the Shell, a franchise inspired by the complex themes, visuals and unconventional plot of the original film. \n\nPerhaps the best part of Black Out is the production side; it looks incredible. Despite being animation, the short carries on the same unique visual style and neo-noir tone from the live-action, whilst also bearing similarities to other cyberpunk anime like Ergo Proxy. The blend of different animation styles works wonderfully here and never feels out of place. The fight scenes here were technically sound matched with incredibly fluid animation. Watanabe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s direction during the action scenes is also stellar, but then again this is the same guy who directed anime the likes of Cowboy Bebop and Terror in Resonance. The short also manages to pay homage to these two shows with some scenes as well. The soundtrack is also noteworthy, being a nice blend of Blade Runner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eerie melodies and jazz-inspired themes from Bebop. Never stands out but compliments many scenes very well. The ending song, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlmost Human\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a great tune to end the short off with, further adding to the overall aesthetic along with nearly every other technical aspect. It is rare to find a show that able to depict a specific atmosphere and mood that both brings viewers out of their comfort zone, yet keeps them intrigued with what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching, and Black Out is a great example of this.\n\nBlade Runner: Black Out 2022 exceeds expectations for what it is able to do in 15 minutes. There are some issues with the story and pacing, and I would have liked to see more in the way of characters despite adequate background knowledge was given on them, but at the end of the day those complaints should not stop you from watching this. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still amazed at how it manages to be so thoughtful and use symbolism reminiscent of the original film. And even if the thematic part of it does not interest you, the action scenes and overall presentation is worth seeing as well. As a fan of the franchise I am satisfied with this entry and look forward to how it relates to Blade Runner 2049."}, {"id": 3339, "score": 65, "body": "From the author of KnB, it not surprising to see that this manga shares many similarities to that series. From the crazy powers to the awkward yet skillful main character, Robot x Laserbeam doesn't really give itself the chance to deviate itself enough from that series' fundamentals to really come into its own (I'll explain later). In KnB at least, the main character was awkward to really build that he had no presence as a basketball player which is why he was so strong. For RxL, the main character being so aloof was no more than a cliche of the awkward genius as well as to serve as a convenient way to explain the rules of golf to the readers. I liked the best friend character, though he was just kind of your typical straight-man to the absurdness of the protagonist and the other side characters. This series sharing similarities to KnB isn't really that much of a problem because I think that it took a lot of good things from it, but since the series had to be cut so short the possibilities of how different of a series it could have been were cut short. \n\nI'll start with the first 30 chapters of the manga, which I thought were a pretty good hook - not only to sell me that golf is cool to look at in the manga, but also that it was unique enough for me to read in the first place. Its uniqueness kind of reminded me of Baby Steps a little, but I digress. The bluntness of the main character made it convenient to put him in troubling situations and entice the reader, which I think the series did a lot of in the first 30 chapters. Like when he confronted the bully golfers and subsequently schooled them, to when he played against Youzan, it really made me warm up to the character. From there it was kind of a snowball effect, the author had set himself up with a series of challenges that the protagonist had to face whilst also making it feel like a climb from the bottom despite the main character being a golf prodigy. The whole arc with Robo having to gain the respect of the club was pretty good, as well as the practice tournament right after showing the skills of all the regulars. And despite having the chance to really develop upon those school club kind of fundamentals, the manga just skips 3 years into the future. Considering that this manga was run in Shounen Jump I guess the author wanted to take a risk, but I really think that it was a mistake. I barely go to know the cast of characters that the manga kept teasing. Sure we got a look into their personalities a little bit, but just barely enough to make them enticing. And once the time skip happened that all kind of got thrown away. It was nice to see that the best friend had become the caddy of Robo's professional golfing career, but I feel like that would have been such a rewarding experience to live through if I had gone on the journey with them through the high school club life. That is, if the series would have lasted through that. \n\nI feel like this series would have benefited through some training arcs and club bonding to see Robo's journey from being a subpar golfer despite having an incredible swing to becoming the professional player we see flash-forwarded to at the end of the series. Maybe the author was pressured by some middling ranks in the competitive Shounen ladder and felt like he had to make that move to survive. And it's a shame because there was some cool ideas, like the different types of golfers - and despite how lame that sounds this series kind of made those '7 Wonders of Golf' sound really cool. \n\nI guess to continue, the series kind of went a bit haywire in the ending 30 chapters. It kind of just assumed that the readers cared enough about the main character for any of his professional career to matter despite Robo not REALLY having enough to carry him through - like, not even a backstory or really built up motivations. Sure, Youzan was a really mirrored rival of Robo's but that didn't really give Robo enough on his own to get through everything. At least the manga got to end on kind of a cohesive note. "}, {"id": 3340, "score": 60, "body": "Once upon a time, there were two young women who couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be more different. Despite the fact that they were both teenagers going to the same high school in Saitama prefecture, Japan, almost nothing about them was similar. Konata Izumi, a petit bluenette with the attitude of a slacker, and Kagami Hiiragi, a responsible honor student with little tolerance for nonsense. One of them comes from a single parent home, the other from a large and closely knit family. One of them devotes her entire life to distractions with little time set aside for academics, the other devotes her entire life to academics with little time set aside for distractions. One of them is rooted in the present, the other one keeping a healthy eye on the future. Ordinarily, two people as drastically different as these two would go their whole lives without crossing paths, but against all odds, Konata became close friends with Kagami\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little sister, having daringly saved her life from a foreigner who was trying to ask her for directions to a thrashable car. And thus, these two individuals who should have never met, met.\n\nYeah, yeah, I know that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a reference for a different show, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m never going to review that show, so I figured I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d use it here. Anyway, the fact that Tsukasa and Konata are in a different class than Kagami leads to the latter being drawn into the former\u00e2\u0080\u0099s world, avoiding what could have otherwise been a major power struggle. She already knew her younger sister Tsukasa, the soft spoken, clumsy and air-headed girl who often depends on her slightly older twin to get by, and while these three make up a troublesome trio all their own, a fourth girl joins their group\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The smart, well-mannered and mature(in more ways than one) Miyuki Takara, who Konata and Tsukasa like to bring their cultural questions to. Together, these four unique high schoolers form a friendship that will last them a lifetime, as they share their joys, their frustrations, their lives and their dreams with one another\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Or just constantly mess with each other and ask inane questions about candy. Honestly, it could go either way. But maybe, just maybe, they can band together to answer one important question; How DO you eat a chocolate coronet?\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked about Kyoto Animation quite a few times before, but if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re worried about me saying the same things I said before, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be. I know they have a consistent style, and while it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s evolved over the years, most titles they release do look more or less like they could exist in the same universe. There are a few exceptions to this rule, and while one of them is the far more popular Nichijou, the first departure they made from featuring relatively normal human anatomy was Lucky Star, which is quite possibly one of the most extreme examples of anime where absurdly large \u00e2\u0080\u009cMoe blob\u00e2\u0080\u009d heads are stacked on top of smaller bodies. Well, you know, if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t count chibi shows. In any case, the fact that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so different from their usual output is probably due to the fact that they chose to produce it as a supplement to their previous smash hit, Haruhi Suzumiya. The two titles are mainly related through fanhood, as Haruhi Suzumiya is a popular series in the Lucky Star universe, and one of the main characters(Konata) is obsessed with it. Sgt. Frog is also big in it, but hey, they took what they could get.\n\nIn any case, when I talk about low budget anime using it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s money wisely to look just as good as a more expensive show, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have a hard time finding a better example than Lucky Star. It may be one of the black sheep of the Kyo-Ani family due to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s somewhat cartoony style, but that translates incredibly well to budget-cutting techniques. Background characters are usually frozen and covered in blue paint-bucket filling as they loiter in the background, a move that would feel cheap and lame in any show with characters who are too weak to distract you from them, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth noting that for at least three-fourths of the time, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll barely notice them. The dialogue heavy nature of the series also gives the animators a perfect excuse to hold on a key frame while the characters talk to each other. There are a lot of high school anime that do this, and I can see where it might wear on the patience of most viewers, most examples of this are anime that are inconsistent, suffer from occasional quality drops, and feature movement scenes that look out of place among the rest of the material.\n\nWhat separates Lucky Star from this lot? Well, the money that the animators saved with their budget saving techniques is put to exquisite use. Every single movement in this series, at least from featured characters, employs just enough movement to capture and portray the mood, intent and gravity of the shot that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in, no more, no less. Because of this, every single movement, from huge reaction shots to the smallest wave, features the exact same level of fluidity, unless of course the style has to change for the sake of a parody sequence, such as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cLegendary Girl A\u00e2\u0080\u009d material. Rather than waste their time and resources on weird angles and filters to keep you amused during long bouts of talking, Kyo-Ani decided to cut the bullshit and make the dialogue quirky and entertaining enough so that the slow, heavily conservative animation wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother you\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 To mixed results, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid to say, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to that later. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d also like to say that whenever they do execute a parody from another series, the animation style they switch to is normally fairly accurate. The moefication of the characters may be a sticking point for some, but I think it was handled rather well.\n\nAs it happens, this is one of the rare anime that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in their entirety in both languages, and for the most part, I can say that Bang Zoom managed to represent the original Japanese acting faithfully. Wendee Lee is a bit of a departure from Aya Hirano\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Konata, mainly because\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 As I mentioned in my Haruhi review\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 She doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have quite the range of Aya-chan. Thankfully, she does much better with this character than she did with Haruhi, employing a sort of relaxed rasp to imitate Konata\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gruff, good-humored delivery. This unfortunately doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always work, such as when she sounds excited or needs to raise her voice, at which points she sounds so much like Haruhi that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s honestly distracting. Still, the rasp is different from Aya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance, but it suits the character just as well. Karen Strassman, on the other hand, is spot on with her version of Aya Endo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character, Miyuki Takara. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not identical, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very close ringer for the polite, aristocratic-sounding character.\n\nMichelle Ruff is something of a chameleon(in a good way), and can play a wide range of characters, so it might be a shock to your system if you hear her in Bleach or Haruhi, and then see her listed in the credits under Tsukasa, the younger Hiiragi twin, a space cadet with an overly soft, shy sounding voice. She doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sound as child-like as Kaori Fukuhara did, which is probably for the better, because her dialogue mainly alternates between innocent musings and woe-is-me whining, and it would have sounded annoying in English had Ruff not aged it up a bit. Out of all the main cast, however, Kari Wahlgren probably had the hardest job with Kagami, a tsundere-type of character whose vocal patterns and inflections don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really exist stateside. Not only that, but Kagami is probably the most nuanced and complicated character in the cast, and while Emiri Kato was amazing in her native language, Kari knocks it out of the park by playing it down to earth, but with a more snarky, confident edge.\n\nRebecca Forstadt gets a heart-warming cameo that I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t dare spoil, Bridget Hoffman is hilarious as Miyuki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dependent mother, and Kate Higgins plays a quirky teacher that Luci Christian would be proud of. Hynden Walch is unrecognizeable as Konata\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cousin, and among her friends, Michelle ruff puts her talents to work playing double duty, the prolific Philese Sampler plays a small role, and Patericia Ja Lee\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably the only sour note in the group, keeping her performance as close to the Japanese as possible, when she really\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Really\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have. But my favorite has to be Stephanie Sheh in the role of Akira Kogami, one of the two hosts of the episode ending segment Lucky Channel, and while I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve preached the gospel about her character range before, she puts it on full display here, playing a character who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sugar and spice personified. She flip-flops between a sweet, happy-go-lucky idol and a crude, bitter behind the scenes personality who, despite being 14, has seen it all and won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take any shit from anybody. I personally recommend the dub, but you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go wrong with either choice.\n\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a certain brand of comedy anime\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Which I believe was popularized by Azumanga Daioh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 That takes the slice of life concept and moves it into the confines of a Japanese high school, so the viewer can observe the daily lives of a group of friends as they interact and develop both as individuals and as a group. Not only does this brand bank on the childhood nostalgia of older viewers, but it also leans heavily on the strong personalities of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s characters to deliver jokes, humorous situations, and the occasional heartfelt moment. This brand gets criticized for being plotless, but is that really fair? Is a plot really necessary for a comedy, or can it stand on it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own just by being funny? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true that most American TV, both animated and live action, is devoid of overarching plots, as they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re most often carried by strong writing and strong characters, but they still have individual episode plots. For more than a quarter of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s run, Lucky Star doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even have that. So, are the characters and comedy strong enough to overcome this disadvantage, like they were in Azumanga Daioh?\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll admit, the show doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get off to a great start. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never been made clear why Yutaka Yamamoto was fired as series director after the first four episodes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Especially since he was the person who created the viral dance sequences that made the ending theme of Haruhi and the opening theme of Lucky Star so explosive\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But rumors and speculation have been made that it was his approach to the series was far too close to the manga, adapting the small, four panel comics one after another, leaving little room for interesting stories and forward momentum. Personally, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t entirely mind these episodes, as long as Kagami and/or Konata were on screen. The four main characters have a very strong dynamic made up of several smaller connections and interactions, such as Konata perving over Miyuki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moe potential, Kagami and Tsukasa being polar opposites, Tsukasa and Miyuki\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 You know what? No. Those two alone just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t amount to anything noteworthy. They need the other two characters to function.\n\nRight in the early stages of the series, Lucky Star goes out of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way to show what happens when Tsukasa and Miyuki are left to their own devices, having a conversation so banal and fraught with unutilized set-ups that Kagami, sick in bed for a surprisingly unrelated reason, is begging one of them to just reach the punchline already. They need Konata to exploit their quirks, or Kagami to call them out, or it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ultimately like leaving jokes on the table. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say Konata and Kagami don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need the other two\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re fairly versatile characters, and different interactions can bring that out in them\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And Tsukasa can be fairly funny on her own, what with her constant airheaded mistakes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But the series is at it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s absolute best when Konata and Kagami are working off of each other. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a reason I based my plot synopsis off of their differences, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not JUST the fact that I had to think of a gimmick just to give this show a plot synopsis in the first place. Out of the four supposed main characters, those two carry the series.\n\nIn most of their interactions, those two are the dominant forces\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Konata making references and shocking people with her weird reactions, Kagami making sarcastic remarks and brutally biting observations\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rare for anyone else to dominate them in an interaction, but they meet their matches in each other. The bickering that takes place between them is easily one of the highlights of the series, as you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always tell who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to come out on top of each encounter, most of which just end in stalemates. While Miyuki is probably the weakest of the four, they still come together to form the foundation of the series. Actually, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re more of a trunk, as the comedic strength of Lucky Star feels like something of a tree. Together, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re strong, sturdy, and have a great dynamic based on the chemistry that they have with one another. The reason I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m comparing them to a tree is that, when you talk about the rest of the cast, it does start to create a weakening effect, just like how a tree becomes more difficult to climb the higher up it spreads.\n\nWhen the cast starts branching out, we get a group of supporting characters for the main cast to work off of outside of each other. Miyuki gets some support from her mother, an entitled slob who appears to take advantage of her brainy and responsible daughter in some cases, which is really when she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at her best. Kagami and Tsukasa have their family for support, including their mother AND father(Both of whom are alive\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 weird, right?) as well as their four older sisters, their conflict with whom helps to develop their characters as well as highlight the special bond that they, the twins, have with one another. Konata, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think her bevy of fans realize this, has THREE characters supporting mainly her, including her pervy father to explain her upbringing, her cousin in law enforcement to highlight the illegal sorts of activities that her upbringing has led her to, and the homeroom teacher, who attempts to drag her kicking and screaming back to reality when she tries to escape to a game. She gets her shots in on all three of them, but it still goes to show just how dependent she is on the rest of the cast.\n\nThe branches of the support characters are strong enough to do just that, but they become significantly weaker when you move to the next group, the underclassmen, a group of younger characters who start to appear in the second half of the series, when even the comedy between the main four is starting to get tired and predictable. Unfortunately, these characters aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t strong enough to hold a story for very long, with only one of them\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Konata\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cousin, Yutaka\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Being even slightly above one-dimensional. This group of friends is more stereotype than people, which is sad, because the characters on the lower branches do, to their credit, feel like fleshed out and complex characters, at least to a point. Yutaka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friends, however, are direct archetypes, and Yu herself doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even DO anything with her quirk, being the sickly girl. Her friends include the pervy mangaka, the ignorant foreigner, the boyish breast-envy girl\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it, and the story seems to give them far more credit than screentime, as they play a major role in the ending. Also appearing at the ending climax are friends from Kagami\u00e2\u0080\u0099s class, poised not as branches but as sub-branches that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t strong enough to hold a freaking apple.\n\nSo in terms of characters, the comedy does get weaker as the show goes on, but that won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter if they grow and move through important events and situations, right? Well, yes, there are a few. There are a few moments that take the cast out of their comfort zone to explore them in new ways. In a later episode, with the main four taking a field trip together, contains a bunch of great moments in it, like Tsukasa being attacked by deer, Kagami getting a love letter, and Konata cheering her up afterwards. The episode soon after, where Konata\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family gets a secret visit, is surprisingly poignant. Some of the best episodes include the beach episode, the Comiket episode, the Christmas episode, Konata\u00e2\u0080\u0099s birthday\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Episodes where something noteworthy actually happens, instead of just a chain of jokes and gags, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s setting a pretty low bar. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no point in getting invested in any of the characters, because unlike Azumanga Daioh, they have no arcs, and their futures beyond high school are left completely unresolved. Yeah, there are some enjoyable moments, and good jokes here and there, But I was never bored watching it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Even if I am in the minority.\n\nI am part of a very specific demographic that this show caters to\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I was an otaku in the mid-2000s. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why I can enjoy it, while most new visitors can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. find it anything but boring. People who enjoy it the most are the ones who watched it when it came out, or in the few years immediately following, but if you came into it after 2010, it probably comes off as one of the most dated anime you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find the characters interesting, the casual tone relaxing, or element of friendship welcoming, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching anime that was created to be a reflection of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time, in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time, and a lot of what it chose to represent isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t relevant today, unfortunately meaning that it hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t aged well. It relied on gimmicks and otaku pandering rather than story-telling and real emotion, and that fact along with it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moe design kept it from having any chance of being as timeless as that other slice of life show I keep bringing up. It gets a lot better after episode 4, but it just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand the test of time.\n\nLucky Star was originally available from Bandai Entertainment, and the DVD sets from then are still available online in both individual, limited edition and complete collection formats, although the DVDs that were produced by Funimation after they rescued the series are far more affordable. The OVA is available on DVD, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also included in the Funimation release, and I think you already know how much I love it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the same series, but with much more fluid and well written stories. The original manga is available stateside from Viz Media. Beyond that, there are a ton of light novels, mangas and games that are NOT available stateside.\n\nCalling Lucky Star an acquired taste is probably being a bit too generous\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the most esoteric series I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen, as it seems deliberately designed to appeal to a small demographic, which I happen to be a part of, and even I think the series is overrated. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appeal is small, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still precious to the people in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s demographic, and I still enjoy it as well, even at it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worst moments. I love the main cast, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot about them that I find relatable. Does that mean I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend it to a high number of people? No, but if you know someone who was an anime fan during the previous decade, or if you know someone who plays a lot of online games, or if you just know someone who has a mischievous sense of humor, this might be a good title to suggest to them. To anyone else, tread with caution, because the phrase \u00e2\u0080\u0098culturally impenetrable\u00e2\u0080\u0099 doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even begin to describe it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth checking out, but if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not into it by the fifth episode, try out Azumanga Daioh or Nichijou instead. Otherwise, this adorkable title has just enough going for it to make up for it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weaknesses. I give Lucky Star a 6/10. "}, {"id": 3347, "score": 50, "body": "\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a Danish princess who was only a few blushing years away from coming of age. She had everything a young princess could possibly want\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 A loving family, the respect of the community, and the most beautiful singing voice in the entire kingdom\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 A voice that could put even the ancient sirens to shame. But as is normally the case in stories such as these, the princess was not satisfied with the luxurious life that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been afforded to her\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 She wanted more, and only the very boundaries she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been forbidden from crossing could grant it to her. Disobeying her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orders, she snuck past them. After a chance encounter with a dying prince, she made up her mind that the one thing she needed in life above all things was to live happily ever after by his side. But there was one problem\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The prince was a human boy, like you or I. And the princess was a mermaid.\n\nNow, before you start telling me that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard this story before, let me assure you that this is NOT the same classic tale that you grew up with\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The one that showed you what it knew you wanted to see. Nay, this is a much darker version of the story\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 A version that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s based on the original Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale. This is not a story of star crossed lovers overcoming the odds to find that elusive ever after that tempts our oldest heroes. Even the princess herself is two years younger than the scarlet-haired maiden you remember. This is a story of infatuation, of sacrifice, and of consequences. Should the princess fail to marry her prince before he winds up in the arms of another, she will not be shrunken down into a weed, but killed, and turned into the very sea foam that reflects the sunlight off of the waves. Will Marina obtain the same happy ending as Ariel, or will she find an outcome that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more tragic and bittersweet?\n\nHans Christian Anderson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s The Little Mermaid\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be referring to by it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Japanese title \u00e2\u0080\u009cNingyo Hime\u00e2\u0080\u009d from now on, for the sake of my fingers\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Was produced by legendary animation department of the legendary Japanese production studio, Toei. While I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a bit ashamed to admit this, Ningyo Hime is by far the oldest anime of theirs that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen, since they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put out the original Dragonball until 11 years later. Because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not entirely familiar with the animation of the time, and because dating must be taken into account, the over-all look of this particular anime is going to be very difficult to describe, but I can probably start by saying that in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time, compared to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contemporaries, Ningyo Hime was probably seen as being exceptionally good looking.\n\nI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really say whether the animation quality at the time was a result of low budgets or just limited technology. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to say it was a matter of budget, because of two factors: First, Ningyo Hime doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look as good as Cyborg 009, which came out seven years prior(Looks a hell of a lot better than Speed Racer, though). Second, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of restraint in the visual direction, as though the people producing it knew they couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let their ambitions supersede their resources. I understand that the anime spectrum was a very different place back then, in a time when you had maybe twenty to thirty new titles coming out each year, as opposed to the several hundreds we get each year now, and people had to take their animation with a grain of salt, but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change the fact that Ningyo Hime has aged very poorly.\n\nAs I said before, this film showed a lot of restraint in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visual direction. This is probably it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main saving grace in terms of aesthetic. On screen movement is kept to a minimum, with most motion relegated to repetitive cycles, and close-ups during any of the rarer scenes that require more fast, precise movement. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say these techniques aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t noticeable, but they do help a great deal. What helps even more is that a lot of the backgrounds that the characters move across are shockingly beautiful. When Marina and her dolphin friend Fritz are swimming across the screen, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re gliding across a watercolor canvas. When they breach the surface, the sense of depth and distance is stunning. The sparkling reflections of the sun and moon off of the waves convey a very lonely, yet serene feeling.\n\nThe color palette is a bit on the dull side, but if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching the newer releases, everything still looks crisp and clear. The use of lighting is also very impressive, although you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really get the full effect outside of scenes taking place out on the ocean, above the surface. Of course, water is one of the most notoriously difficult things to animate, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to reluctantly admit that the waves here look more like blue-green claymation than anything else. The character designs are firmly a product of their time, a sort of early shoujo aesthetic, where the only body parts that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look anatomically accurate are the character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anime eyes, which are still only half as big as what most otaku are used to.\n\nThe music is also dated, but I actually quite enjoy listening to it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s made up of slow, pleasant tunes, played through with harps, pianos, and various wind instruments, and the original singer of the few song tracks has a perfect amount of wonder and whimsy in her voice. One thing I kind of have to knock it on is the way this music translated through to the dub. The opening credits song had all of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lyrics removed, leaving only the baseline and a few accompanying instruments of what used to be a really pretty song. They actually managed to rewrite the song from Marina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s graduation into English, but the dub singer just kind of mumbles her way through it, rendering it an incomprehensible mess.\n\nAnd speaking of the dub\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I am at a loss for words, which is exactly what I wish they had been. The title role of Marina was played by Canadian voice actress Kirsten Bishopric, who was about 20 or 21 when that movie was dubbed and released stateside, and she could not act her way out of an uncut-plastic soda ring. I know dubbing back in 1987 wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t on the same playing field that it is today, but since it was released on VHS in response to the popularity of the Disney version, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d think they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d hire a main actress who doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sound like a monotone Scarlet O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Hara. And her little Dolphin friend is played by, no joke, the same actresses little brother, Thor, who sounds like the only directions he was being given were \u00e2\u0080\u009cSpeak really loudly into the microphone\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cSound sad for this scene.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThey both did go on to have long acting careers, fortunately, but Kirsten tragically passed in 2014 at the age of 55. The rest of the cast is more or less okay, considering the lack of screen time they got, but the dude playing the Prince Fjord, Ian Finlay, somehow has less personality than the guy who played Prince Eric, if you can believe it.\n\nSo, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t normally review anime movies. The last one I looked at was Oblivion Island, but I did that mostly in blow-by-blow format, and in retrospect, that review kinda sucked. I was able to talk about that movie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ending without actually spoiling it, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to do that with Ningyo Hime. Of course, the movie is 40 years old, and the original story it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s based on is over 100 years old, so spoiling it would be a bit like telling someone how Romeo and Juliet ends\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They probably already know, and if you heard about Ningyo Hime from someone before reading this review, then they probably already told you way too much\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They probably told you that it features the original tragic ending that Andersen himself conceived so many years ago. That still doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean the story\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as well known as everything else in the public domain, so before I go any further, this is my warning: I am going to address the elephant in the room.\n\nMarina dies at the end. I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell you how it happens, or what circumstances led up to it, but she does not wind up with the prince, and she does not live happily ever after. Yes, Japan was killing mermaids long before Hayden Panettiere was around to try and save them. The little mermaid dies, which stands in stark contrast to the ending of the Disney version. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen plenty of reviewers talk about this, but both movies star an entitled teenage girl who doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how good she has it, and wants more out of life. There are arguments against the Disney version stating that Ariel learns nothing, but still gets exactly what she wants in the end, while the conclusion of the anime is a lot more honest and offers a better life lesson.\n\nNingyo Hime teaches impressionable young children that when you obsess over somebody based on infatuation, which you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve basically mistaken for love at first sight, and are willing to give up on everything you have just to be with them, you are most likely heading down the road to disappointment. This is a very good point, and it underlines a very important life lesson that kids need to hear. I actually have two problems with it, though. The first is that if you look at the central conflict of both movies through a modern lens, you can draw the metaphor a little further. Ariel and Marina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conflict is very similar to the issue of gender identity.\n\nNotice, both of these characters were obsessed with the human world before meeting their princes, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not hard to surmise that they both feel, deep down, that they were born in a way that they weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t meant to be\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Mermaids who were meant to be human, just like men who were meant to be women. When you shine that light on it, the plight of both girls begins to feel less selfish and more sympathetic. Sure, their lives may be perfect from an outsider\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perspective, but are they supposed to just bottle up who they truly are and just live a lie for the rest of their lives? Doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the movie where the heroine gets to be who she was born to be and love who she wants to love feel so much more powerful, now?\n\nAnd my other problem is, of course, going to lead to some bigger issues. Yes, Marina experienced a tragic end that takes the literal interpretation of Ariel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conflict to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more logical conclusion, but a tragedy doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel deserved unless it was inevitable. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel right unless there was one damning flaw the hero possessed that ultimately led to them deserving to lose it all. And I hate to say it, but Marina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happy future was brought down by a talking cat.\n\nI suppose in some way we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supposed to believe that the cat is the sea witch in disguise, but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make any sense. First of all, the witch has nothing to gain by sabotaging her client. She already has her voice, and she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to hate Marina at all. There is no indication that she stands to gain anything, tangible or otherwise, from the devastation of the royal family. Secondly, She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not portrayed as being evil in this version. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shrewd, and she controls storms, but she seems like more of a force of nature than a villain. No, the true villain of this story is a talking cat who hates Marina, wants to see her suffer, and is able to talk to Fjord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parents without either of them saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cHoly shit, that cat just spoke to us!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just an example of how badly written this movie is. People complain that the Disney version brought a happy ending into the mix, but they also brought quaint little things like pacing, intricate plot points and actual characterizations. Much like the cat, most of Ningyo Hime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meager cast of characters barely get any screen-time, being introduced to perform a role and than disappearing for the rest of the film. The perfect examples of this would be Fritz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s whale uncle(Not blood related, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m guessing? He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more of an uncle in a \u00e2\u0080\u0098family friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sort of way?), and the guy with the weird nose that probably died after Fjord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ship went under. Even Marina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Dad and her romantic rival are given bit parts, and the Disney version had much more expansive roles for them! Marina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sisters fare a little better, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eight of them, and the perform a role that would have been satisfactory had ONE side character performed it.\n\nIn a well written story, people and events that occur to further the plot aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just thrown away after they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve served their purpose. Everything comes back in some way, even if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just in reference, or a punch-line that reveals what happened earlier as being a set-up. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just resolve an issue by creating a character who can solve it and then dropping them afterwards. Take, for example, School Rumble\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 There are several sight gags that you think are just going to be forgotten afterwards, like Harima accidentally confessing his love to the wrong girl or turning into a monk with an entourage of zoo animals, that wound up becoming running gags and important plot points later on. Ningyo Hime is terrible about this, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just as bad about weaving the characters it does have into an intricate plot. There are so many things that happened in Ningyo Hime\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The wolf attack scene, in particular\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 That, if you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see them, you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t notice anything was missing. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to say it was a bad movie, but the execution was terrible, and it desperately needed to be updated for new audiences. The Disney version did exactly that, which is why I really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind the very real possibility that it ripped off the anime. Honestly, stealing from an existing source isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t such a bad thing if you do something new with it and fix a lot of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s problems.\n\nHans Christian Andersen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s The Little Mermaid is available in several different formats. It was originally released in VHS form, and to address another elephant in the room, yes, the mermaids were all topless in it. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not necessarily a bad thing, but for a stateside release, it did make the G rating a little misleading. A DVD release was eventually put out by UAV Corporation, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so heavily and sloppily edited that it can hardly be considered the same movie. Seriously, they just took every appearance of bare breasts or blood and chopped them out of the film, regardless of whatever snippet of music or dialogue they were losing.  Finally, last year, Discotek Media released the full film, uncut and beautifully restored, with a much more appropriate note of \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot rated\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the back. A twenty-six episode TV anime was released in the early nineties, but I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen it, so I have nothing to say. The Disney version is also available\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, pretty much everywhere.\n\nIn it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time, Ningyo Hime was deservedly a big deal, and I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take that away from it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a significant entry in the history of the medium, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably the most accurate portrayal of Andersen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original story that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ever going to see. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth checking out at least once, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not worth holding up on a pedestal. Whether you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking at its story from a literal or metaphorical perspective will determine whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s message is important one about discretion and self-control or a severely outdated one about ignoring your true self for the greater good. If all you want is to see the original dark ending to a story that inspired the Disney classic, or even if you just want to see a 14 year old anime girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bare breasts, then this movie is for you. As for the rest of us, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a significant film that should be experienced, but not celebrated. I give Hans Christian Andersen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s The Little Mermaid a 5/10.\n"}, {"id": 3356, "score": 50, "body": "Jean Raltique is a 14 year old inventor living in 1890\u00e2\u0080\u0099s France. He and his uncle are participating in the Birdman Rally, an event that wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually be established until 1970\u00e2\u0080\u0099s England, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be gracious and ignore that fact. He falls in love at first sight with an exotic looking circus performer named Nadia, who wants to return to the place of her birth, which\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Due to her dark skin\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 she believes to be Africa. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re attacked by a trio of jewel thieves, and are chased all the way back to Jean\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house, where he smoothly offers to fly her all the way to her home. Another encounter with their aggravators leaves them stranded out at sea in a floating plane wreck, until they(and their pursuers) are picked up by a futuristic submarine named The Nautilus. Grand adventure and intriguing mystery await the five of them as they begin their journey to find Nadia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s birthplace and unlock the secrets of the strange blue jewel that she possesses, in a story that was inspired by two of Jules Vernes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 most famous works, and the imagination of Hayao Miyazaki himself!Well, I say that, but this series wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually made by Miyazaki\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It was his idea, but after some initial financial controversy, the project was picked up by Studio Gainax, a rising animation studio who recently changed their name from Daikon in order to pursue more high profile titles. After already having a successful movie and OVA series under their belt, Gainax decided to take Nadia as their first televised series, and it was highly successful\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 to a fault, even, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to that later.\n\nRight from the first few minutes of episode 1, Nadia shows you exactly what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s animation style is going to be. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re shown a few frozen panning shots of people enjoying themselves at a science fair, immediately followed up by the impressive CG effect of an electricity machine. This is indicative of a well allocated budget, where the bulk of the production money will be spent giving motion to scenes that need it the most, while leaving other shots\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Not all of which will be as unimportant as these opening ones\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 High and dry. Thankfully, the budget is managed well enough that those opening shots are the exception rather than the rule, and for the most part, this show does look very good. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the rare example of Gainax looking inconsistent in a GOOD way.\n\nWhile it may look cheap and dated, in terms of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visual style, keep in mind that Nadia came out back in 1991, when an anime couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look expensive without actually being expensive, due to the limits of the technology of the time\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 High frame rate, Miyazaki quality productions were a rare treat, and the lesser spectacles were given a lot more leeway than they are today. Having said that, as cheap as Nadia can occasionally look, there are a ton of moments in the series that look like they could have come straight out of Ghibli itself\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The visual of Nadia daringly leaping down from the Eiffel Tower to protect her sacred jewel is only a small taste of this, and it will in no way be the last.\n\nWhile most of the character designs may seem generic at first, they grow on you more and more as the characters in question develop throughout the story, and their backstories begin to become unraveled. There are only two designs that really stand out right from the start\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 One of them is Gargoyle and his sinister cult of Neo Atlanteans, the true villains of the series whose actions are unfortunately wrapped in spoilers too heavy to discuss. The second one is Nadia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, as she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wearing what has to be one of the most iconic outfits in Studio Gainax\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history. It works very will with the backstory of her being an acrobat and a utility performer at a circus, but if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re being honest with ourselves, the reason this design has endured for over twenty years in peoples\u00e2\u0080\u0099 memories is because of how revealing it is. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to say this is necessarily a bad thing, as I know that women should wear whatever they want to without feeling ashamed, but it does feel kind of strange when you consider that Nadia was wearing a normal looking European dress when we were first introduced to her, implying that that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how she likes to dress when she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s off the clock\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But for the rest of the series, she seems to prefer skin baring clothing so much that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tear entire pieces off of any other outfit that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s handed to her. Again, this wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother me if it felt like her decision, and not just that of a horny animator. And if you think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just seeing things, go ahead and count her fan-service scenes.\n\nBut that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the only thing about her that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s made her such a fixture of Gainax\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also, in general, a very likeable and dynamic character. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cautious around new people\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Who wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be, after working in the circus for so long\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s willing to give them the benefit of the doubt after she becomes more comfortable with them. Her convictions and principals are also a very strong part of her character. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pacifist who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s adamantly against the idea of people killing each other for any reason, and while this belief isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t portrayed as strongly as it was in Trigun and Fullmetal Alchemist, she also takes it a step further by being a strict vegetarian\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yes, she believes that animals and people should both be spared from the wrath of greedy humans, and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not afraid to act on those beliefs, even when it may cost her the good graces of her peers. She can be difficult because of this, but she never seems to cross into the territory of becoming unreasonable, at least not until\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to that later.\n\nOh, and her baby albino lion has giant balls. Because\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yeah, courage, and stuff. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s awesome.\n\nJean isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really as complex as his nimble crush, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some bland self-insert character, either\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The darker tone of the series takes its toll on his happy-go-lucky outlook, maturing him just like the rest of the cast. He also has a very distinct personality, even if other personalities sometimes overshadow his in the story. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very open about his feelings for Nadia, that visibly develop from infatuation to actual interpersonal romantic interest throughout the course of the series. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very passionate about technology, and not just about his own inventions, but about the technology of the anachronistic Nautilus submarine, as well. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fascinated by Nadia and the Nautilus, and will take any given opportunity to learn as much as possible about both, as they respectively become the inspiration and the basis for his future inventions, since only a flying machine can take Nadia to the faraway land she yearns for. But just because he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an inventor doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean he can just whip up deus ex machina devices whenever he needs them\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Unlike that Mary-Sue technology-bender from Big Hero Six, Jean\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inventions are consistent with his familiarity of technology and the materials available at the time, at least until\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Once again, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to that later.\n\nSurprisingly, those two aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always the most likeable characters in the cast. I mentioned before that the three villains who attacked Nadia for her jewel go through a heavy amount of development and reveals, and I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t kidding about that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They have a backstory that will redeem their actions almost immediately after you hear it. The motivation that led them to the Nautilus changes soon after they take up residence in it, which is a refreshing development compared to the Team Rocket baddies that they almost certainly inspired. They become more and more relatable as time goes on, and there are points when their roles in the story become even more interesting than that of our two main heroes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 In fact, after one of them pulls off the daring rescue of a young orphan girl named Marie from a Giant Enemy Crab, I could see him instantly becoming a fan favorite.\n\nAnd the English dub, well\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the worst I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever heard, by far, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also not really up to par with the time period in which it was released. It was initially dubbed by Streamline Pictures, and if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re familiar with their work on films like Vampire Hunter D and Wicked city, then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d probably guess that Nadia is one of their better dubs\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be wrong, and sounding worse than those two titles is saying a lot. The dub was picked up by ADV films after Streamline put out the first eight episodes, and ADV completely redubbed them, producing much better results\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Mediocre results, yes, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still much better than the awful Streamline dub. While the ADV version isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bad by any means, the only actor that really merits any praise is Meg Bauman in the role of Nadia, who puts forth a much more sincere performance than voice acting heavyweight Wendee Lee. Actually, that seems to be a common theme of this dub\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 A cast full of unknowns who would mostly go on to have very brief careers in the industry did a much better job than a dub full of respected talents and recognized mainstays.\n\nIt is worth mentioning, though, that Nathan Parsons has gone on to have a moderately successful live action career. Most recently, he played the role of James in True Blood, which I guess is an interesting bit of trivia.\n\nAside from Nadia this is a dub that has to grow on you in order to be enjoyed\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 There are several characters sporting foreign accents that are fake-sounding, inconsistent and half-committal, with the worst offender being Parsons in the lead role of Jean. His attempt at a french accent replaces all of the \u00e2\u0080\u0098th\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sounds with \u00e2\u0080\u0098s\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and \u00e2\u0080\u0098z\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sounds, but aside from that, he barely inflects when he should. Sanson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s upper-crust accent sounds irritatingly like James from Pokemon(Which makes sense because Grandis sounds like Jessie and Hanson sounds like Meowth, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think any of this was accidental), and in the role of Elektra, Jennifer Stuart focuses so hard on perfecting her British accent that she barely emotes in the process. As I said before, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a bad dub, and all the performances do grow on you after a while, but unless you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a hard core dub fan like I am, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really no reason to switch the Japanese version off.\n\nSo, when I started watching this series, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know whether or not I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be able to review it, and I had Mahoromatic on standby just in case. The problem was, of course, that there wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really anything to talk about. It just felt like a really, really well made action adventure/title. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t terribly deep, but it was well written, wonderfully paced, and it was able to handle a large, diverse cast while showing respect to all of their differences in background. There were clashes between the beliefs and ideals of our main characters, especially where Nadia was involved, and there was an admirable level of ambiguity in regards to who was right and who was wrong. All in all, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really have anything interesting to say about it, and I was fully ready to review something else\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Until IT happened. It, which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been putting off until this point in the review. It, which if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen the series, you know exactly what It is.\n\nSee, as the series was airing, it was earning very high ratings\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And deservedly so, all things considered. Because of this, the network got greedy and hired an entirely new director to extend Nadia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 26 episode run into a 39 episode run, adding in 13 episodes of filler material just to pad their precious success\u00e2\u0080\u0099s run time. If you ask any Nadia fans to talk about the series, this story arc will inevitably be one of the first things they bring up, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s believed to be the single worst thing about the series. And having seen it for myself, I can say that this assessment is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Completely accurate.\n\nAfter some spoiler events occur, Nadia, Jean, Marie and Nadia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lion cub King wind up stranded on a mysterious island, with no clue where they are, and no hope of summoning any of the ships that they keep seeing out in the distance. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll say right off the bat that this idea, in and of itself, wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a bad one. There are a ton of ways this development could have been a great opportunity to further the depth of the series\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that at all. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boring, it drags the pace of the series down to a dead crawl, and it does everything in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s power to kill, dismember and display the remains of everything that was good about the show up until that point. The animation quality also tanks, looking uglier and cheaper than it ever did before. No joke\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 This show has worse filler material than Naruto and Bleach combined.\n\nTo be fair, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not actually bothered by the fact that this filler arc screws up the original material. Representing somebody elses work can be an extremely tough thing to do, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think anybody should ever be vilified for failing to do so. What bothers me is the outright contempt that the new director, Shinji Higuchi, had for the original material. You see warning signs right from his first episode, which I believe was 23, when the four children of the series are riding a jettisoned mini-sub to reach the mysterious island. The sub starts to flood, and Jean drinks all the leaking water, blowing up balloon-like as though he were a freaking Looney Toon, despite the entire series up until that point featuring no such cartoon physics whatsoever. He then spews the water back up, which in retrospect is pretty good metaphor for the way Higuchi barfed up the rest of Blue Water.\n\nHiguchi had no respect for the themes and characters that had been unfortunately entrusted to him. It also becomes clear all too quickly through his treatment of Nadia that he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t possess a very high level of respect or understanding for women or vegetarians, either. Immediately after setting foot on land, Nadia turns her back on the very idea that her companions may have to eat meat to survive for an extended period of time, as the canned food they brought over with the mini-sub won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t last them very long. Instead of working this out with him rationally, she dashes off into the jungle like a monkey and goes feral, which ultimately culminates with her stealing his food cans and crushing them under rocks, despite the fact that the island is clearly shown to be covered with fruit bearing trees. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not a vegetarian myself\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Far from it.. But when I hear Nadia saying things like \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go a week without food and water to prove that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a better survivor than you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d it even offends ME.\n\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say Jean is a whole lot better, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 With Nadia reaching levels of likeability that make Asuka Langly Soryu look like Belldandy, Jean is left to fill out the role of \u00e2\u0080\u0098smug white male,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a role that would be more subtly played by Seth McFarlane. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Jean\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job in this story arc to be right about everything, sigh and shake his head whenever that angry woman-thing yells at him for no reason, and whip up inventions from the giant piles of ABSOLUTELY NOTHING that the island has to offer him in terms of material.\n\nAnd the relationship building that happens between the two is the absolute worst of it. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t consider this much of a spoiler, because it has nothing to do with the plot or ending, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to describe the moments that begin their relationship in detail\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 This is going to be a rough patch, so brace yourself.\n\nNadia finds an old, moldy can of spinach. She eats it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Because it looks so much more appealing than any of the plants on the island\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And it gives her a fever. Not a stomach-ache, but a fever. She winds up sick in bed with Jean going out to fetch herbal medicine for her\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 for the second time in the series, I might add. But he winds up finding a patch of drug mushrooms, which knock him out, so Marie has to drag him back to the tent. Later, Nadia wakes up, completely fine, despite receiving no medical care of any kind, and is told by Marie that Jean tried to help her. She kisses his unconscious lips, and all of a sudden, her attitude completely changes towards him\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 All because he tried to nurse her back to health. Like a fucking pet.\n\nOh, and later, after they finally share a consensual kiss under the stars, she blows up at him for not remembering the kiss she gave him WHILE HE WAS UNCONSCIOUS.\n\nIn other words, this director has boiled women down to petulant pet dogs\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They bark at you for everything, can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand or care about your feelings, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll love you forever if you help them while they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sick or otherwise vulnerable. Puke. Well, at least the relationship development doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wind up mattering, because after they escape the island on a popped balloon that never runs out of air and wind up in Africa, she falls head over heels in love with some sexy African guy, which gives her a new reason to hate Jean. Like a dog finding a new crotch to smell. Oh, and then there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an episode of music videos.\n\nI wish I could just look past this story arc and consider it non-canon, like so many other people do, but I just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. The show does eventually get better, with the animation and writing returning to their former glory around episode 35, but that 12 episode stretch is just unbelievably awful. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard people say you should skip most of those episodes, taking the entire viewing experience down to episodes 1-22, 30-31, and 35-39, and while that would successfully cut out all the awful, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really improve the experience, it just makes it more confusing. If you follow this list while watching the series for the first time, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll wonder about the things happening in those episodes, like \u00e2\u0080\u0098when did this character come back,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098how did these characters come to this point,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and \u00e2\u0080\u0098was that material really as bad as I was told?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sorry, but those episodes aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t self contained, and the only way to know how much of an improvement the abridging of the series would be, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have to have watched it all the way through at least once\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And by that time, the damage is already done, to both the viewer and the series. That island arc, sadly, does NOT suck as an island.\n\nNadia: Secret of Blue Water has been available on VHS in the past, but is currently available on DVD and Blu-ray from Sentai Filmworks. Both sets are available online for quite a bit of money,you can occasionally find sales. The collection 1 and 2 DVD sets that were put out a few years ago are available for fairly cheap on Ebay, and you could say the same about the individually released DVDs that ADV put out in the early 2000s. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a series of video games that have never been released stateside, and a movie that I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually watched yet\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Although I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard some not-too-flattering things about it. At least I know that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a sequel, and not just one of those BS cash grab retellings.\n\nI really wanted to give Nadia a high score. I really, truly did. If it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for that filler arc, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be calling it one of my favorites of all time with no problem at all. Without them, Nadia is an exciting adventure title that never slows down, offering romance, wonder, and new surprises at every turn. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some sexism at play, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largely innocent, and hits both genders about equally, never turning into straight up misogyny until the dreaded filler arc. If my initial introduction to this series had been to the episode list that many fans\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And even the original director himself\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 considers superior, I may have been nicer to it, but that sadly wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the case. I can watch it without those episodes, but I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t review it without those episodes, which is why I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to give Nadia: Secret of Blue Water a 5/10.\n"}, {"id": 3357, "score": 50, "body": "\n\nYucie is a seventeen year old girl\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Although you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know it at first glance, because a strange curse stopped her growth at age ten, freezing her permanently in the body of a tiny tot, and forcing her to go through the embarrassment of being treated like a child by every single person she encounters. Fans of a certain detective show may think they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen a plot like this before, but where the two characters differ is in the fact that Yucie actually has some semblance of hope towards one day reaching physical adulthood. Hidden away in the highest point of her school is a mysterious artifact called the Eternal Tiara, which is the prize for one lucky student with the qualifications to be crowned Platinum Princess!\n\nWhile she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gotten used to taking her vertical impairment in stride, Yucie becomes a candidate for Platinum Princess, and decides when she wins the crown, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll use the one perfect wish that the Tiara grants to bring herself back to what should be her actual height and proportions! But the task won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be an easy one, as she must contend with and ultimately overcome four other candidates, similarly stunted girls hailing from the spiritual, demonic, heavenly and fairy worlds. One by one, these strange girls become friends with Yucie, helping each other to overcome the trials and tribulations of community service and hunting for crystal flowers, but as team work and loyalty see them through to the end, can their bond survive the very competition that drew them together?\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said this before many times, to the point that I probably sound like a broken record\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Gainax\u00e2\u0080\u0099s animation quality is inconsistent. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said it for more or less every show of theirs that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve reviewed, and the same goes for Yucie\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But to a different effect. Coming hot off the heels of reviewing Gurren Lagann, a series that could change animation quality on a dime, Petit Princess Yucie is instead restrained throughout the majority of the production, with fast imagery and high octane action being the exception and not the rule. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say this anime looks bad\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Far from it. the low budget animation is handled extremely well, never feeling too cheap or lazy, with occasional cg effects incorporated in naturally.\n\nWhen the budget needs to pick up, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t disappoint. The first time we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re given a taste of what truly looks like Gainax animation is in a chase scene in the Demon world, and while it may come out of nowhere, the bizarre scenario of a demon princess trying to cure her entire kingdom and friend/rival of the ruse that turned them into cats will have soundly prepared you for such shocks. Action packed chase scenes aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the only deviations from the norm, however, as this series can suddenly thrust you into unexpectedly inspired moments of breath-taking artistry pretty much whenever it feels like it. The overall effect can be very disarming, especially when in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worst moments, it resorts to bouncing characters up and down to simulate walking.\n\nThe design choices are a bit on the bland side, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like there aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any hints of inspiration and effort in it. The human world looks pretty standard for what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d normally expect from a magical pre-technology environment, with your villages, castles, and horse-drawn carriages, with it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only really unique element being the dragon in the lake that serves as the village elder. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a comfortable and homey sort of setting, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fairly forgettable when compared to the much more visually pleasing alternate worlds that the other four candidates hail from. The character designs for the five girls do a great job of reflecting this, as do their familiars to an even greater degree. The music in this series is incredibly diverse, which is once again no surprise, coming from a Gainax show. The orchestration is very Disney-esque, relying primarily on light hearted piano and string-based tunes, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not afraid to twist these conventions and in some cases even venture outside of them, whenever the mood of a scene demands it(Beth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Scene is a perfect example of this). It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very pretty sounding show.\n\nWell, it would be, if it weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for the dub. There are only a few actors who I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d consider straight up bad\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yucie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first friend Cocoloo comes to mind, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recall a single performance sounding anywhere close to good. Rachel Rivera plays the title character Yucie, and she sounds like\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the best way to put this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 She sounds like Dora the Explorer without the accent. Similar voice, same pitch, she constantly sounds like she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about to turn to the audience and say \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo YOU know how I can grow taller? That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right!\u00e2\u0080\u009d which isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t to say that she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have good emotional range, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still really distracting. The rest of the cast\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Main and supporting\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Is made up about 90 percent with actors whose resumes are shorter than Yucie herself. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a joke, either\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for the life of me find a single other role from Rivera, and while there are a small handful of other mid-2000s anime roles sprinkled throughout the cast, the only noteworthy names are Jason Leibricht and Larissa Wolcott, who both play familiars to the main girls.\n\nSurprisingly enough, most of the rest of the cast is credited to have appeared in the DC Universe Online video game, which might be a sign that they were outsiders to the anime medium. Lee Eddy, who plays the fairy princess Beth, had a few titles to her name, and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably the best performer in the group\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Having the most complex character probably helped\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weird that her biggest roles were in Yucie and Red Vs. Blue. Monika Bustamonte and Leigh Fisher can barely act, and Kelley Huston\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 God bless her, she really tried, but enthusiasm doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t equal talent. I did find the actor playing Cocoloo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s familiar to be amusing, but that was more a matter of gimmick than actual acting. The show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primarily for kids, so they probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the same complaints, but if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching as an adult, subs are preferable..\n\nOne of the most problematic things a critic can do is try to review children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s media. I mean, you would think it would be obvious that some children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movies are better than others, as anybody observing the vast difference in objective quality between Frozen and, say, Bebe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Kids will tell you, but what does an adult\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opinion matter when either movie has the power to make a kid shut up and watch TV for over an hour? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve encountered this problem several times when dissecting popular kids movies, and especially when ranting about the Planes movies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just kids movies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll hear from hard working parents who just want to get a few hours of peace. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho do you think you are?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ask my own parents, who are fully well aware of the kind of terrible shit I watched when I was a tot. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re right, for the record.\n\nPetite Princess Yucie is a kids\u00e2\u0080\u0099 series. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very obviously intended for children, and that makes it very difficult to criticize. I know some of us like to think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll only show our kids good media, in order to help them develop good taste, but in reality, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more trouble than it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth, and people develop their tastes as they grow. Even the best of us will let our kids watch something dumb as long it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inoffensive enough. But does this mean that, from the perspective of a writer, is it okay to be lazy and pump out effortless movies? Is The Magic Voyage really just as good as Frozen? Well, considering the fact that even little kids couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make it through Norm of the North in theaters, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obvious that kids do have some level of standards. So how do I judge the quality of Petite Princess Yucie?\n\nWell, ideally, what do people look for in Children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s media? Ignoring the lowest common denominator of \u00e2\u0080\u009cMake my kid sit still for a while,\u00e2\u0080\u009d what are children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stories supposed to do at their best? I guess the first thing most people consider is whether or not said story teaches a lesson to the audience. Most childrens stories were founded as fables and parables for exactly that purpose, so does Yucie have any lessons to teach your tot? Well, sometimes, yes. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not often, I grant you, because most of the episodes revolve around conflict and magical solutions, but there are a few good lessons sprinkled throughout as well. The relationship between the Angel Princess Elmina and her father offers a touching window into the way a parent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attitude and expectations can affect their children on a psychological level, and the fact that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no shame in failing and trying again. Aside from that, there are strong themes of friendship and tenacity, which I guess gives this series some value.\n\nWell, what do we have next? Entertainment value. Could a child sit through this show from beginning to end? I gotta be honest, it was hard for me. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m an adult, and I predicted literally every single twist and turn of the plot at least a few episodes in advance, sometimes more. Little kids won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have that problem, or at least little girls wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. I guess I could see little girls getting invested in this series, at least in a Sophia the First kind of way. If you can get invested in Disney Princesses, than I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see any reason why this narrative would bore you. The plot might be a little too complicated for younger noggins, but the overall flow of the story is more than simple enough to follow, and even if it did get boring at times, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d go so far as to say that the last third of the series is more than epic enough to reward even parents for their patience.\n\nBut speaking of parents, is this series safe for kids? Well, for the most part, yes, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sterile enough for parents to not have to worry about what their kids are being exposed to\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The only exceptions would be, unfortunately, the difference in standards between Japanese and American cultures. Now, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not saying there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s any fanservice in this show\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The count is just about exactly zero, with nary a single wardrobe malfunction, nude tease, or panty shot present in the entire run time. This is a feat unto itself, especially for a Gainax show, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be remiss to not warn you that there are some interactions between characters that parents may find problematic. Yucie, despite being physically ten years old, has a 17 year old love interest, and not only do they both clearly have feelings for each other, but he even steals a kiss at one point, making for an uncomfortable situation all around. Also, some parents may see red over the mutual romantic attraction that takes hold between the Fairy princess and the Spirit princess.  No, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not saying same-sex affection is bad, but considering what got cut out of Cardcaptor Sakura\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\nBut the most crucial element of a children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s show, that even parents will have to admit the importance of is this; Will kids want to watch it in the first place? Well, why would they? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Japanese series that hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even survived the test of time in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own country, wallowing in obscurity for most comers other than Gainax completionists like myself. The only kids who are likely to have even heard of this title are the ones with otaku parents who introduced it to them in the first place, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very narrow margin. You can buy this title for your daughter in hopes of hooking her on an anime, and you may even be successful at it, but considering how obscure it is, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have to question whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really worth the effort with much more popular and well known children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fare floating around out there. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to argue with where this final element leads us\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yucie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appeal to kids is shaky at best, with even the most likely target audience being extremely unlikely to have heard of it in the first place, and thus unlikely to ever demand it.\n\nSo what about it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appeal to adults? Well, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll admit that if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the type of person who just likes cute, pleasant stories, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll probably enjoy this one. For those of us looking for anything more, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a chore to sit through just to get to the episodes that are kind of good. Yes, there are a few individual episodes that can be somewhat emotionally compelling, and there are several of artistically impressive moments sprinkled throughout, and as I mentioned earlier, the ending is actually quite good, but there is so much pointless, inane fluff that you have to sit through in between that I considered dropping the series at multiple points and found myself constantly having to rewatch episodes that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d slept through. I really want to give Yucie credit for all the little things it does right, but you just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forgive execution and pacing this tedious.\n\nPetite Pruncess Yucie is available from ADV Films. It was initially released as five individual disks in the early 2000s, before being released as a thinpack box set in 2006, and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been out of print for ten years,with no signs of a re-release yet. The license is currently owned by AEsir holdings and Section23 films, but it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem like they have any plans for it in the near future. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not available on Netflix or Crunchyroll, the single volume manga is not available stateside, and the soundtrack CD, which I actually would recommend picking up, also seems to be universally unavailable. Unless you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re planning to watch illegally, good luck with this one.\n\nPetite Princess Yucie isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anywhere near Gainax\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worst work. It at least manages to be more watchable than about a quarter of the other work they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done. The animation, being as low budget as it was, is very impressive, as is the very lively soundtrack and musical composition. The characters are likeable, which to be clear is not synonymous with interesting, and while it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surprising to see Gainax tackle such family friendly fare, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remarkable just how safe for Japanese children they were able to keep it. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bad series, but I just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forgive it for how boring it is. Maybe it would have been better if it had been condensed down into a 14 episode run, but as it is, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think of anybody I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d reasonably recommend it to for any reason other than to make a point. I give Petite Princess Yucie a 5/10.\n"}, {"id": 3359, "score": 50, "body": "War is Hell. These words, famously spoken by Union soldier William Tecumseh Sherman during the American Civil War, have lived on ever since, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been used on many occasions to describe the bloodshed and rampant loss of life that can happen when nations engage each other in combat. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably one of the most apt metaphors ever constructed by man, but what if it were to obtain a literal definition as well? What if there was a war that actually involved the forces of hell, with actual demons fighting both against and alongside the human race? This is exactly what happened in the Vaalbinill war, a conflict where mankind used a powerful magic to turn human sacrifices into powerful demonically-possessed swords called... Well, Demon swords. To do this, a human on the verge of death must read the death song that every person has hidden inside them, which creates a contract for them to sign... One that binds their souls to a magically enhanced sword... Only a few of which can take human form afterwards.\n\nAlas, this war ended forty-four years ago, when the warring nations realized the damage these demon swords were causing, and reached a peace treaty to prevent the collateral damage from reaching a point of no return. Now, in the present day, the stories of demons and sacrifice have faded into legend, and people are just trying to get by, with very few reminders of the conflict left to haunt them. One of these, a demented homeless veteran of the war, is creating a scene in the middle of the marketplace when Cecily Campbell, a third generation knight who has vowed to protect the city and uphold justice in her late father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name, is almost killed by this man before a quiet boy with a strange curved sword saves her from him. Realizing his occupation as a blacksmith, Cecily becomes determined to convince him to make her a sword that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just like his... A katana, the sort of weapon from a faraway land, which she believes will aid her in her quest of heroism. He refuses, but she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to find a way to change his mind, as the past has rapidly began to catch up to their land, and Cecily\u00e2\u0080\u0099s courage will soon be needed more than ever before.\n\nSacred Blacksmith was produced by Media Factory, who, incidentally, are also directly related to MF Bunko J, the company who published it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s light novels. Both companies are located under the umbrella of the Kadokawa Group, and from what I could tell from Media Factory\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Wikipedia page, they mostly do small jobs for other production companies, especially to Studio Gonzo and TMS. Out of the titles I actually knew, I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find any anime credited to them that had their name listed as their primary producer, with the soul exception to this being 2009\u00e2\u0080\u0099s The Sacred Blacksmith, and if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s indicative of the larger truth, then thank God, because this show looks a bit on the mediocre side. Maybe that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of mean of me, because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve definitely seen a lot worse looking anime than this over the years, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of obvious that they had a small budget to work with, and it looks like they probably didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to handle such a hindrance in such a way that it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be too noticeable.\n\nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what bothers me more... How cheap this show looks, or how commonly cheap it looks, as it carries a lot of the same visual problems that an anime from the late 2000\u00e2\u0080\u0099s is likely to have. It tries to juggle it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s budge responsibly, with minimal movement being featured whenever possible in order to save more money for action scenes, but those stationary scenes look lazy as hell, as characters freeze almost right into the background when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not talking or reacting to anything, and they often do so while just slightly off-model enough to create an uncanny valley sensation, and the action scenes aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t great either. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re plagued by close-ups and zoom effects to make it look like you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not just cutting from one stationary image to the other, and while this doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always look too bad, especially if the villain of said scene is represented by some pretty decent CG animation, the amount of cut corners is telling. Backgrounds can be nice and highly detailed, especially when taking place in the market, but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t save the characters inhabiting them from looking stiff and lifeless.\n\nIn terms of the visuals, the only thing about this show that really gives it any sense of identity is the design of the main character, Cecily Campbell, who almost seems like she was drawn to catch the eye, what with her striking shade of red hair and highly questionable knight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s armor that looks like it was specifically molded in such a way as to accentuate her breasts(we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to that). With the exception of the Demon Sword characters, who look like support characters taken from various Final Fantasy games, everyone else looks pretty generic, from the titular blacksmith, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only real memorable feature is the fact that his left eye is always shaded differently from his right eye(there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a reason for it) to the villain, who... And I realize this is a spoiler, but come on, who wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see this coming... Is of course a sinister looking guy with long white hair. This is an anime, damn it, and you should expect things like that by now. The non-human villains look pretty good, especially the CG ones, but we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get very many of them.\n\nI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really notice the music while watching the series, but I never had any complaints about it either, which I guess is a good thing. The opening is your standard rock anthem, with Mayumi Goto belting out lyrics about virtue, triumph over evil and the struggle to do so, and while it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty generic, it sounds nice. Some of the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best and worst animation is showcased during the video, clumsily moving between stiff characters in the middle of breathtakingly beautiful backgrounds to characters awkwardly trying to move against said backgrounds. A lot of the same could be said for the ending song, miracle happy day, which is also nice but generic. I like how each song is meant to represent a different character, with the opening representing Cecily and the ending representing little Lisa, but the latter has the added benefit of also being the character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actual voice actor. As for the rest of the score, it was composed by Terashima Tamaya, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty cool overall, especially the epic Kishi no Hokori. The sound is appropriately medieval, with a lot of drums and wind instruments at play.\n\nWhile the music and animation may not be quite good enough to make an impression on you, the English dub is another story entirely. Funimation did a fantastic job on this one, to the point that even at some of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worst moments, the quality of the acting can still get you through. While these titles are by no means her first starring roles, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t until Strike Witches that she started to become a big name in the industry, and her role in The Sacred Blacksmith came right on the heels of that, and if anything, it proved that she could carry a series while moving away from more diminutive characters. It combines her likeability, strength and sincerity in such a way that it feels almost like a precursor to some of her future roles, like Lucy in Fairy Tail, Asuna in Sword Art Online and Ilia in RWBY. From what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve read, the character of Cecily was a really unpopular one in the original sub, with fans reacting negatively to her due to her big, grandiose talk and seeming inability to back it up, but Cherami\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance does a lot to alleviate that issue and saves the character, even at her worst in the early episodes.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m normally not a huge fan of Blake Shephard, but he does a pretty damn good job as the titular Blacksmith, Luke Ainsworth. The character is supposed to be really cynical and blase, which Blake captures really well with his lack of intonation and devil-may-care attitude, adding in just enough hopeful or long-suffering vibes whenever necessary. Monica Rial plays his assistant, a cheerful little girl character who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s generally happy-go-lucky and annoyingly obsessed with his love life, and while this may sound like the kind of role Monica normally gets typecast into... And it is... Her casting was NOT a frivolous decision, nor was it just-another-paycheck for her. She does a lot with this character, and deserves praise for it. Anastacia Munoz plays the demon sword Ilia, and she does a great job, but oh what the hell, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just glad to see her. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a huge fan, and she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get enough work. The rest of Funimation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s usual squad of regulars show up at some point or another, with some highlights including Alexis Tipton as a spurned princess, Brina Palencia as a tragic victim of fate, and Colleen Clinkenbeard and J Michael Tatum as probably the only choices that could have made the boring villains more interesting.\n\nAnd speaking of making things more interesting, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly the kind of task that Funimation had in front of them when they acquired this anime, which is probably why, when they announced the upcoming release, they were not the slightest bit coy about the fact that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be nudity in the release that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there in the original TV run. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if that nudity was censored on TV or if Funi just edited it in, but whatever the case, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really telling that they went to such great lengths to advertise the presence of some unobscured boobs, although as many forum-dwellers noted back then, it was probably due to the lack of interest that people had for the title. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true that nudity can be used well, and be an essential or at least acceptable part of a story, but in this case, it was very obviously being used as a crutch in order to help sales of the title, much like they wound up doing years later when they accidentally released the censored version of Sankarea; Undying love a few years later.\n\nNow, at first glance, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re coming in blind and just looking up the plot synopsis and descriptions of the series, it looks like you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be in for something awesome. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a show about knights and demons in a feudal setting, starring a cute and well-endowed female protagonist, and it deals with the introduction of katanas into a western society. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of potential there, and you could be excused for going in with some pretty high expectations, even to the point that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d probably be willing to look past the sub-par animation quality. The katana worship kind of suggests that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be some element of eastern influence creeping into the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s western setting, or that Luke would have some kind of foreign background that could be explored, or hell, even the plot about the war that took place decades prior to the events of the series could have amounted to some kind of interesting intrigue. What I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m saying here is that there was a lot of room for cool ideas, and while they may have possibly been exploited to some extent in the source material, they weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t here.\n\nRight off the bat, this series shows signs of disappointment from pretty much all corners, from the bullshit about swords cutting through other swords to the fact that anything cool about the art of blacksmithing would be largely glossed over in favor of magical weapon creation. The plot and setting are extremely derivative and offer nothing new or unique to stand out against the thousands of feudal-type anime out there, and the villain is about as boring as you can get. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even remember what his plan was, and I seriously didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care about any scenes dealing with the effects of said plan. It takes a special kind of failure to make small demons popping out of peoples\u00e2\u0080\u0099 mouths boring, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where we are here, and the main characters aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much better. Cecily and Luke are trapped in a will-they-won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t-they dynamic that never goes anywhere, not that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d WANT it to, you just want it to go literally anywhere else so you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to listen to their inane bickering and cliched nonsense.\n\nPart of this is of course Cecily herself, who appears to be some kind of joke character, preaching idealistic virtues like justice and compassion, self-sacrifice and heroism, all while proving herself to be ridiculously incompetent, having to be saved at every turn and not being taken seriously by just about anyone. She kind of reminds me of the protagonist of Now and Then, Here and There, but taken completely out of context to her own detriment. Her relationship with Luke is full of pure cringe, as she plays the rough, brutish tsundere to his asexual jerk, flashing boob and berating him for accidentally seeing it, blushing and fervently denying any feelings for him when called out, and most insulting of all, trying to weasel out of paying for the katana she wants him to make. Cap all of this off with a little girl obsessed with playing matchmaker and pointing out how generously well-endowed Cecily is, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got what looks on the surface to be a jumbled mess of bland, cliched elements that nobody was asking for all merged into one show.\n\nSo, is there anything in this show that makes it worth watching? I think so, but this is the part where things are going to get a bit uncertain. If there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anything interesting about this series, then it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not in the text, but in the subtext, or at least out of what I could read into it. Now keep in mind that this is an entirely speculative interpretation of the material, so take it with a grain of salt, because there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite a bit to unload here. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t start to pick apart any kind of deeper meaning to this series until the character ilia was introduced(at which point the series does manage to get quite a bit better, assuming you were able to make it that far in the first place) but when I did, I started noticing some very specific subtext, from which I managed to work backwards and figure out the over-all theme of the story, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m actually quite confidant about this part of it(my interpretation gets a little shakier later on), where the main unifying idea of the Sacred blacksmith seems to be the importance of self-identity, especially when compared to the indentities placed upon you by others.\n\nThis idea is explored in some surprisingly diverse ways, with the most obvious being the storyline between Luke and Lisa, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kinda of heavy with the spoilers, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d instead like to start off with Charlotte, a young girl who begins to make trouble for our heroes halfway through the series. She declares that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a princess, the bastard daughter of the king, and demands her rightful place for the sake of her late mother. She instead gets refused by her father, and at the end of her arc(mild spoiler alert) she instead abandons her royal lineage and defects to another nation. This may sound like defeat, but think about what she was trying to do... She was trying to fulfill the dreams of her mother and gain the approval of her father, but was either of those goals what she wanted? What would avenging her deceased mother or proving herself to her father have done for her? I mean, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obviously the idea of attaining wealth and status as royalty, but she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show any interest in that. Instead, she dropped the Royal title from her name and started over on her own terms, choosing to define herself as an individual.\n\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also the demon swords, three of which can turn into humans... Well, four, but we only spend any time with three of them... And they all seem to fall into the same category, as characters who are burdened with the identities thrust upon them by their creators. Even the chant that they use to change form explicitly states that their purpose is to slay God, which could be read in exactly that way. While two of them are also heavily rooted in spoilers, I think we can talk about the first one, ilia, the demon sword who possesses the power of wind. Ilia has been around since the great war, where she was born on the battlefield, and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been responsible for countless deaths, the lives of which were taken by her wielders as well as by people wanting to become her wielder, killing said wielder and taking their place. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sick of being used as a tool of murder, which is why her life changes so drastically when she forges a partnership with the idealistic Cecily, who... Oh dear, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to start talking about her now.\n\nOkay, so, this is the part where it really becomes a stretch, so bear with me. The idea of self-identity gets a lot more complicated with Cecily, as it also starts to creep into the territory of sexual identity and gender identity, yeah, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that kind of show. Cecily is a character who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trying really hard to find out where she belongs inbetween the masculine and feminine aspects of her personality. Unlike Charlotte, who wants to become a princess for the sake of her mother, Cecily becomes a knight for the sake of her father, even though such an occupation is explicitly shown to be male-dominated, and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never taken seriously as a member of their ranks, facing both condescension and open resentment for trying to do what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s considered a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d even go as far as to assume that her breast plate was molded specifically for the purpose of accentuating the shape of her bosom, as the military considers her more of a mascot or a PR stunt than an actual knight, and in all fairness, she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do much to prove them wrong.\n\nNow, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not the kind of person who sees a sword in a story and says \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a dick,\u00e2\u0080\u009d unless I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m making a joke about Bleach or something, but that old symbolism cliche does kind of fit in this case, when you consider just how unsuccessful Cecily is while trying to wield them in her attempts at doing what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s considered men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work. Either they break in her hands, or she flat-out refuses to kill, which is both suggestive of compassion which is a traditionally feminine trait, and on a more low-brow note, a sign of impotence. Yes, I am also including the fact that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unable to get the main male character to \u00e2\u0080\u0098erect\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a sword for her in my analysis, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re welcome for that. Keep in mind, though, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just as bad with feminine pursuits, as she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s uncomfortable with the idea of drawing attention to her looks, and she fails hard at performing house work, and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really awkward in any sort of feminine clothes, so it could be said that both masculine and feminine ideals are waiting just out of her grasp.\n\nHaving said all of that, she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t start to grow as a character, to gain more confidence both socially and in battle, until she acquires a female partner who acts as a sword for her, and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s finally able to perform successfully. Granted, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no actual confession of love or confirmed affection between her and Ilia, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still really easy to read their relationship as a romantic one, with some seriously Utena-esque subtext to back it up. There are several lines of dialogue that seem to almost deliberately imply something deeper than friendship, although that could have just been Funimation rewriting things. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how things between Luke and Cecily went in the source material, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s typically not my style to look into things like that, and Cecily really does seem to grow and develop as a person after her and Ilia form their partnership. Granted, this doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really go anywhere special, as Ilia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s insistence on Cecily continuing to pursue Luke does kind of echo the very Japanese idea of lesbianism being a teenage phase, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just the interpreter, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t write the damn show.\n\nSo, to summarize, The Sacred Blacksmith seems to insist that you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t become a complete person until you come to terms with your own identity, and in order to do that, you shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t live by other peoples\u00e2\u0080\u0099 standards, you shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t live for the approval or fulfillment of your parents, you shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try to be more of a man, you shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try to be more of a woman, you shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try to live up to the role society has placed on you, and you shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t live according to the rules of your creator... You are you, and you shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lose sight of who you are and what you want. And what if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just pulling all of this out of my ass? What if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just reading too far into the material and seeing what I want to see? Well, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incredibly likely, but it would be a damn shame, because that added depth is really the only thing this show has going for it. On it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own merits, The Sacred Blacksmith is just about the blandest thing you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll ever see, with it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only real saving grace being that it gets less boring about a third of the way through, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll stick to my interpretation, thank you very much.\n\nSacred Blacksmith is available from Funimation, now as a part of the SAVE collection. The original light novels are not available stateside, but the manga adaptation by Isao Miura are available from Seven Seas entertainment. It also makes a very brief cameo in the anime Haganai.\n\nIn a general sense, I want to like everything I watch, or at the very least, I want it to be worth liking, and since there really isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anything outright awful about this particular title, the fact that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m able to read something deeper into it helps me to appreciate it perhaps a bit more than it actually deserves. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not one of the worst anime I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen, not by far, but the fact that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not interestingly bad just adds to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lack of noteworthy qualities as part of the reason why I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d ever recommend it to very many people. I guess you might like it if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a hardcore fan of either the feudal setting or of Cherami Leigh as an actor, or hell, maybe if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going through some crisis of identity and need to watch something that might help you affirm your own self-image, and maybe you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see the same subtext and symbolism that I did. Other than that, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not an outright bad anime, but it really doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t offer anything that you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find elsewhere in both bigger and better portions. I give The Sacred Blacksmith a 5/10.

It is, however, equally a potential casualty of its proficiency that separates it from the norm."}, {"id": 3366, "score": 65, "body": "I really like using a dark concept which exists in some anime or movies because you can look further at a realistic circumstance in reality both in an exaggerated way or less noticeable. One of my personal mostly touches on how the realistic of the concept is Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood because the movie used ambition and religion as both contradictory concepts that would never united. The movie also proves that not only the concept but the movie doesn't need to exaggerate such way when you wanna turn off all important characters in the movie or anime without any obvious reason or not even it doesn't need it at all. One great example is Naoki Urasawa's Monster, an anime or manga which tells the deepest side of humanity. Same as Akame ga Kill! At first, I really praised this anime but when I've read the manga, I changed my thought through the anime and I know this anime has a really huge fanbase. One of the influential of why this anime can't be said as a dark anime is because there are so many characters in this anime that turned off without any clear reason, no development, and no plot. Don't get me wrong, I really like this anime from any aspect even with the variation of characters. However, this isn't a dark anime and it will never be included in the category.\n\nFirst of all, maybe I'll analyze deeply especially on the characters. So, this review will contain a lot of spoilers. The story follows Tatsumi, a young boy who travels to a capital to join the military and get money for the sake of his downturn village. Tatsumi considers that the capital is a better place than his village until he realizes that the capital isn't the one. At that time, he met with Night Raid, an assassin group that fights against the government and desired to eliminate a downturn in the capital. Actually, Akame ga Kill! was so promising at the first and I admit that because it's told in a quite realistic way apart from this is just the same as a shounen anime in general. The main protagonist has a plot armor in the first episode where he accidentally survives the invasion of Night Raid. This character is not like other shounen protagonists in general because he is not too exaggerated and tries to reach it from oblivion into the badass character. Yet, this anime mostly dominated by heroines character and just a few male characters exist. Therefore, Tatsumi seemed to be covered by these characters and he doesn't too accomplish when participating in the story. Sure, it's so dark that I can't see watch this anime. Although it's not a problem when I want to see a sexist yet badass psychopathic waifu that kills a lot of people, it's not too filled in conveying the story even in a different context. The story seems to be lost in the way which is like a shounen anime in general, the tone is always changing, the emotional turn into comedy, it goes on, and on. It's so awkward from a dark anime that looks promising at the first episode suddenly turns into a comedy which is just dark in front of the cover. I don't really feel the emotions when there is one memorable character or at least, one of your favorite characters are dying just like that without any plot devices or developments that encourage other characters. One thing, some of the heroines in this anime are also waifuable but at least I don't recommend if you want to do it but it's just according to you, my friends if you don't want your mental fall.\n\nThe animation and the visual is pretty good. One thing that I like the most about this anime is that it only comes from blood and the colorful characters design. The choreography is decent but the final fight at the end of the episode is well-executed. Like White Fox's anime that I've watched in general, Akame ga Kill! doesn't show every detail too much but at least I could see from this aspect rather than others. The gore is also pretty good.\n\nJust like the animation, the sound in this anime is so great. I didn't really listen to the soundtrack, but the first opening theme songs are freaking awesome along with the ending theme songs. \"Skyreach\" by Sora Amamiya who also cast Akame is so goddamn rock as she is also one of my personal favorite seiyuu. \"LIAR MASK\" by Rika Mayama is even better than the first opening but I also like both. It's so swinging in the head with a loud and badass sound. The ending songs also fit with the lower contrast but both are memorable. \"Konna Sekai, Shiritakunakatta\" by Miku Sawai isn't too memorable but pretty average, to be honest. \"Tsuki Akari\" which was also performed by Sora Amamiya is such a nice song with a perfect tone and nice lyrics. Both the opening and ending songs are suitable when they both increase the tension at the first and ends with a soft tone than the first one where the songs are not too complex but just simple. Satomi Akesaka as Esdeath and Kana Hanazawa as Seryuu Ubiquitous are the ones which mostly dominated from all because of they just out of the character and performs two personalities.\n\nNow, this is more getting serious. I will discuss more the characters along with their particular roles. First of all, Tatsumi as the main character in this anime is a stereotypical but not a problem. He has a strong, good impression, and started everything from scratch especially when he learned a lot from Bulat. Now, the only problem in this aspect is that most characters are turned off without a plot that encourages other characters or a memorable impression between them. Although the title said that Akame, she is not the main character. We learn about her depressing backstory enough with her sister if you have read the manga, Akame ga Kill! Zero, a prequel from the parent story. Akame is like a cold assassin, doesn't show any emotion, and doesn't dominate too much. When one of her friend, Sheele, dies in the Seryuu hand, I think Sheele would be a powerful plot of Akame's character. But, there is nothing changed at all and just like she didn't show her emotions except in a few scenes. One more important thing is also when her sister, Kurome, died in her own hands, she just showed a few instant emotions and nothing changed in the next episode. Bulat's death which is also one that encouraging Tatsumi is not too emotional as the characters in general because as I said earlier, it turns out into a comedy. However, Tatsumi can become well-developed thanks to Bulat and if there is no Bulat, Tatsumi is nobody. Mine's death which was also that encouraging Tatsumi wasn't that sad because I didn't feel anything about her character. Lubbock is also not too emotional even though I know very well why he joined Night Raid. His death in the manga version is even more sadistic than in the anime but it doesn't change my own opinion. As the story progresses, there are two characters that join the Night Raid: Chelsea and Susanoo. Susanno is an emotionless character because he isn't a human. He is a human who had no feelings but he learned a lot from Tatsumi. On the other hand, Chelsea is one of the personal characters in this anime despite her small roles. Both in the anime and manga, her death is the most memorable because it feels so depressing and sad. She has everything in the character starting from her feelings, emotions, beliefs, and her situation to cause her the most real character of all in the Night Raid.\n\nBesides Night Raid, there is Jaegers. Jaegers isn't the main antagonist in this anime even though it looks like that. There are several reasons why I said this and we are going to talk later. This squad was led by Esdeath, one of the sadistic, cruel, and feared general by the rebels. Esdeath is not like that because she still has a feeling that still makes her control her emotions. We learn about her past and she learns about a natural law. Her feeling for Tatsumi doesn't change her personality in her role and she still believes him even though Tatsumi is a member of Night Raid. Besides Esdeath, one of the characters that I remember the most is Bols. Although not as sad as Chelsea, he died in an honorable way but it was such an emotional way. Although there are not many flashbacks explained, he has a peaceful family because you cannot judge someone behind the mask he is wearing. Dr. Stylish, a crazy scientist is okay, Run is also very different in the manga, Wave has a similarity with Tatsumi, and Kurome who really love eating just like Akame. Regardless I like Kana Hanazawa, Seryuu is not one of the characters I like but I don't hate. It's not that one of the characters in this show has a twist in its own impression. Her crazy personality can be said as a lunatic fringe among other characters. In a nutshell, Seryuu is a representation of not just looking at the cover because I just think at first impression was already so deceptive.\n\nLike I said, Jaegers are not the main antagonist. Night Raid and Jaegers are like Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader where Sheev Palpatine is a mediator, the person behind everything. Night Raid can be described as Luke, Jaegers can be described as Vader, and the government and things related to it can be described as Palpatine. Bottom line, the characters feel bland without any emotion in less. It's so exaggerated at first and the remains of the characters don't show any clear reason why they just turned off. The death of each character doesn't feel like a character. It's just like, \"Oh, he is dead? Okay.\" Just a few who look alive and show emotion even though the author and director also gave them backstories but didn't work so well. But, this is what I like too because they turn it off without leaving any existence. Take for the example of Lisanna Strauss from Fairy Tail. Her character leaves a trace for Natsu but as the story progress, it's playing at your mind and feeling because it's as if they make a joke about death even though there is a clear reason for itself. The second example is Nagisa Furukawa from Clannad: After Story. We learn the process of how she met Tomoya, she married him and had a child but she died when her child was born. But, guess what? The director and author are like laughing at you from behind where they are playing with your emotions even though I know there is a reason why it can happen which it just doesn't make any sense. Kaori Miyazono from Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is one anime that leaves a memorable impression of its character. Her death made us feel so realistic and emotional because the moments she had done before the story and this is what I love, her character is real, has an emotion, a feeling, and there is a development at the end of the story especially for the main character. It's different from Akame ga Kill! which feels meaningless because they turn off these characters without any strong reason. Of course, they also made an ONA, Akame ga Kill! Theater where all the characters who die both in Night Raid, Jaegers, and the Capital live in a world where it becomes a story of how they are gathered in the next life. Seems neat, am I right?\n\nWriting at much from the characters really feels like something are missing but Akame ga Kill! could be one that can change my perception at the beginning. Regardless of the characters which are turned off, there is a variation of characters, a great animation and visual, a badass song, and one of the overrated at the season until now. Well, this is the one that I remember the most when I watched it at school and I just feels like, \"This is the most depressing dark anime I've ever seen.\" Yeah, sometimes, you also have your own guilty anime such as my personal High School DxD, Yosuga no Sora, Kiss x Sis, and other ecchi harem anime. The show does have funny humor despite the humor which is in the wrong place. The pace is fast for 24-episodes anime. It's not that bad, but I prefer the manga.\n\nAkame ga Kill! it becomes a great knowledge for those of you who wanna make a story or also the viewers if turned off many characters who have an important role will never make it as dark. On the other hand, it's not the worst show ever. The gore is really too much if you really love an anime that has blood everywhere. Seems like Quentin Tarantino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shit. The animation and choreography are great especially the final fight at the end of the episode just make me goosebump whatsoever. Therefore, this anime can't be watched by everyone but this is one of my memorable shows for several reasons. The characters also look waifuable even though I could say if you wanna look for it in this anime. I freaking love this show, at the first even though for now, I still like it. The manga has a much better story because the story in the anime seems to be forced without any source. But, it's up to you my friend because Akame ga Kill! is as much as possible as the most favored by the community."}, {"id": 3370, "score": 60, "body": "In almost any form of art, the use of contrast can be a very powerful tool to enhance the appeal of your work. By taking two different items and setting them against each other, it can multiply the overall value and effect of the product versus those two items being standalone. It can make paintings have a captivating appearance, give food a memorable flavor, and, in the case of movies and television, give a unique experience that makes it stick to the minds of the audiences watching. There is, however, a catch to this: the right amount of each item must be balanced against each other lest one overpower the other or it turn away potential customers/viewers/etc. So how does the use of contrast affect the anime School-Live? The answer is important - after all, it's what the entire show hinges on.\n\nSchool-Live is an anime that wishes to contrast two different atmospheres, cute and creepy, in its 12 episode runtime. It combines a cute high-school slice of life show with that of a zombie apocalypse. The reveal that there's horror in something charming is sometimes hidden from the viewer to make the turn of events more shocking, but in the case of School-Live, it's its worst kept secret. The show's synopsis, poster, and tags all give away what's happening. Even before the big reveal, it's pretty clear that something's wrong inside the show's world.  That said, the show's use of zombies isn't really where the main focus lies. Instead, it uses this as a tool to test the survival, and psychological skills, of our main protagonists.\n\nEach character is given a slight role to the group. Kurumi is the twin-tailed fighter of the group and uses her trusty shovel to fight off the occasional zombie rush. Yuuri serves as an organization leader of the group and is shown keeping down a list of supplies as well as \"approve\" of certain events. Miki is the newcomer and though she is the youngest of the group of girls, she is the smartest and most practical of the group. Finally, there's Yuki, the chipper voice of morale and mascot of the show. A black hat with cat ears is worn over her head filled with ideas of what to do during the group's downtime. Together they make the \"School-Life\" club, a club dedicated to doing what they can to \"help\" other groups and make school the best place to be. The price for this dedication is to stay on school grounds at all times, but considering what's going on outside, it can hardly be considered a downside.\n\nOf course, the club the 4 girls form isn't really an official club - rather, it's the way that they help keep their sanity in check. The supernatural fear outside combined with the claustrophobic environment inside can get to a person, so pretending to have ever-popular school events such as a sports day and field trips can break the monotony of survival. This is where the show wishes to use its contrast. It shows a typical school life setting against the fear of a horrific death. Every event is limited not by a school budget or time, but rather what the girls have on hand. Throw in the chance of something horrific happening during each day in their fortress and you've got a show that certainly finds a place for itself.\n\nThose looking for a chance to see some intense girl-on-zombie fighting will be sorely disappointed. Sure, Kurumi swings a shovel a few times but it never focuses on the action. Instead, it offers two alternatives: goofing off and twisted tales. The former is to deliver the \"cute\" half of the show's contrast (as well as attract the audience who enjoy idle, silly fun). The latter is the core strength of the show, as we get to see how these girls truly feel about the events that have occurred and the fears of what the future may bring. Yuki is the obvious choice for this category, as she simply pretends nothing went wrong and thinks every day is another fun and fantastic day at school. I do find her to be a bit immature, though. She's a senior in high school, and yet I feel like I'm watching a kids show when she performs her antics. Miki is for my money the best of the cast. Her story is a personal one, much like the others, but the emotions feel amplified as a result of the lack of interactions she gets as well as the isolation she has from the rest of the world. The main cast get a school and make up fun activities - during Miki's origins, we get none of that and instead get a greater fear of the unknown. It's arguably the greatest moment of the show.\n\nWith these details in mind, does School-Live find a balance between its two genres? For some viewers it does, but I can't say it did for me. The show has a habit of pointing out a few flaws in their own show but ultimately struggle to answer them. The biggest example of this include part of the field trip episode. There's danger looming all around and, especially later in the show, a fear of supply management as resources start to dwindle down. Yet there's enough time for swimsuits to be tried on. The excuse \"We are girls, after all\" doesn't really work here and suggests that the show is also trying to attract an audience via alternative means. A better strategy would be to stock up on more of the zombie's weaknesses (sound and light based items, such as glowsticks and child alarms).  Another example stems from how coincidental everything is. With the school's vast amount of natural resources,  it definitely feels apt for survival. This seems to be hinted at something greater, but not enough detail is given. A good question to answer would be how long do the zombies live for? Right now, I am to believe they are immortal unless they are explicitly killed. In the end, it's a supernatural story so anything the author wants can be put into place. This latter point is only minor, since this is the first part of the story. However, a little enticement for the future can go a long way with keeping people interested - it comes off as more credible than trying on swimsuits.\n\nThe ultimate issue will lie with the audience. I enjoy some slice-of-life but it's not a genre I can say is my favorite. Sure, it's cute watching the girls run around and make stupid jokes, but I really don't gain too much from it. I'd much rather see a form of progress across the city or more of what's happened with the world rather than be confined in the halls of the school. Considering that's half of the show's appeal, it's quite clear that I'm not meant for the show's audience. That said, it'd be foolish for me not to admit it's a necessary evil. Had the show entirely be focused on the mystery and horror, it probably would've received more criticisms of shock value and wouldn't have found as large a fanbase. That's really the takeaway of using the contrast strategy - the balance in the creator's eye may be imbalanced in the eye's of the viewer. That's why we all have different likes and dislikes, after all.\n\nThe animation studio behind School-Live is Lerche. There are a few shortcuts here and there (the CG zombies in one scene being the #1 shortcut) but they do a fairly good job. Bright, cutesy colors for when everything's fine and shades of purple, black and dull gray for when zombies are involved. Arguably the scariest thing about this show may be the character's eyes - their irises are a bright ring that contains a dark colored pupil. They're sort of unsettling to look at. The music for the show consists of goofy, lighthearted pieces and some dramatic tones - mood music, mainly. It sports a catchy OP \"Friend Shitai\" and a relaxed ED \"Harmonize Clover\" to end episodes on a lighter note (with the tongue-in-cheek \"Good Night\" displayed after the end of early episodes). The real grab would be the moody piano piece \"We took each other's hand\", used perfectly for Miki's scenes and again amplifying her backstory. The voice acting is also good. The seiyuus know how to deliver a dramatic scene or a scream when needed. Yuki's is a bit too \"bubbly\" for me, but it's appropriate for her character.\n\nOverall, I give School-Live a 6/10. It's a show that's not for everyone - again, this is a show for people who want a slice-of-life AND a bit of psychological horror. If you're more in the former camp and don't mind a darker show, this will probably be the anime for you. If you're more in the latter camp, I'd advise to pass on this one unless you need something a bit lighter, as strange as that sounds. School-Live is a short and interesting watch that shows that even a strange contrast can give a show staying power.\n\nDo you like or dislike this anime?

It's tempting to just blame everything on the character's inability to act reasonably \u00e2\u0080\u0094 frankly, it's easy enough to do so with any kind of character \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and as it is, too easy to derail the entire thing. At the end, though, Tetsuo was fleshed out enough that his aspirations, demeanor and incoherent actions could be taken seriously. His impotence before his own art, his incompetence at connecting with others, his unaware selfishness and immaturity before everything, all amounted to him as a character (if it amounted to him as a person, though, it's another story altogether). The only thing that felt out of place were his daddy issues, brought up literally two times as if they were a big thing but entirely forgotten otherwise. I wouldn't say it was anything remarkable as a character-driven story, but everything was in its right place for it to work.\n\nI just wish I could say the same about Akira, though. She was nice, real nice, I like her, but I felt like her whole aspiration in the story was to love tetsuo and...not much else. The not-tetsuo-centred insights she had were too brief to grasp anything concrete about herself, and I left her as if she were still a stranger. Even the fact that she apparently wrote articles for an art magazine, which was something I was genuinely interested to hear about, was mentioned once and never brought up again.\n\nI mean, it's a love story. It's supposed to have at least two protagonists, so it's kinda sad when only one of them remains in the spotlight while the other is allowed only to watch from afar. I get that her role was supposed to be that of an observer, but it's still not reason enough to suppress any character traits she might possess.\n\n~!The mangaka was also nice enough to not stall aroung too much as a lot of romance manga like to do, and bold enough to give us the fitting ending instead of the one that would satisfy us the most, so I congratulate her for that.!~\n\nAll in all, it was a fun read, though it's not something I wish to come back to. The art was messy sometimes but mostly agreeable, but it doesn't stand up to other romance manga."}, {"id": 3385, "score": 54, "body": "\"FATALITY!\" -Every Mortal Kombat game since 1992.\n\n*SPOILERS FOR DRIFTERS*\n\nWar is hell. We know this to be true by now. This also applies to the fact about there being a lot of \"sent to another world\" anime adaptations. You really need to do something really unique to stand out if you're one of these shows, and while I'd like to say that SAO and Re:Zero conditioned me to think otherwise, its obvious that their additions to the concept alone (bloodthirsty video game world and reset after death respectively) were what made them stand out, even if the actual concept, for most part does the exact opposite. With this show, they decided to make it have a full-fledged war, with loads of carnage peppered throughout. The concept is very interesting, especially since the war consists of famous people from many different eras of different countries. It's sort of like the Fate/ series, except that this time, all of the combatants were based on real people instead of sprinkling mythological people into the mix. So, was this a true breath of fresh air for the genre? Did it manage to do that while being a genuinely great war story? Well, let's find out, shall we?\n\nSo, there is some kind of conflict between Easy and Murasaki (which doesn't get explained or fleshed out) that caused them to start sending people to this unidentified new world in which there are two main factions at war: Drifters (deceased war heroes), and Ends (once noble beings who have gone bad for their own reasons tying into their demise, but not all of them have their backstory shown to us). There are also humans who enslave two kinds of demi-humans: elves, and dwarves. Drifters are fighting to bring down the human governments of this world via conquest, and destroy the Ends, while the Ends are fighting to destroy the world and all inhabitants (despite the fact that their leader just wants the demi-humans to be the main inhabitants). So, what the hell happened here?\n\nUltimately, the first few episodes were rough. Not only were there some minor plot holes, but there is one gigantic issue that really damages this series: the tone shifts. You can have a moment in which villagers all horrifyingly stab a man to death in brutal fashion, and then seconds later, they show cracks a random joke. They do this so often, and sometimes, in the most inopportune of times, ruining some of the darker and heavier moments of the show. Sure, this means that, inevitably, a few of these end up being funny, but, for most part, they end up harming more than helping. \n\nThe series does pick up, but a few new issues really hamper this show. Every time one of the Ends is about to die or be defeated, we suddenly get their backstory in order to make the story sad, and that just doesn't work. In order for that to work, we need the characters to be more than just one-dimensional baddies before-hand, and they pull this stunt three times! Also, the finale just...ends, without any major resolution. Just, a battle ends, and here is one image of where each Drifter is at the moment, in an obvious, and quite frankly, rushed sequel-hook, particularly because some of the characters, like Scipio and Butch Cassidy, have been left by the wayside, especially Scipio with the fact that he has been left in the jungle but suddenly he's in a navy ship with a character that has only been seen for one brief moment. Hell, there are other moments that required some time to explain, like how the Drifters suddenly got human armor when their last battle (which was two episodes prior) didn't have nearly as many people killed to remotely equal the amount of armor and weapons present. Shame too, since if this concept was explored more and the story were tightened up, this would've definitely been a good first season to what looks to be an otherworldly war epic.\n\nIt's really hard to tolerate these \"Drifters\" early on. I mean, they were all a bunch of quarreling assholes without anything interesting about their character, and by the end of it, some of the more minor additions (like Hannibal and Scipio) were still like that. Luckily, our main trio grew. Toyo is a crazed warrior who loves decapitating enemy warriors, as long as they are male. His culture and all Japanese war cultures at the time do not like the thought of women engaged in combat. He ends up also being a bot more chivalrous towards females and children than his cohorts while understanding people more than he probably should (reminding me a lot of Ragna the Bloodedge, from the Blazblue game series) and I'll touch on that in a bit. Nobunaga is a much more brutal tactician as well as being a hardier individual than his allies. His violent streak, as a result of his culture and his multiple times being betrayed, makes for some of the best usages of military tactics I've seen in a war anime in quite some time. Yoichi ends up being more in between when it comes to his companions' traits, but with more of a tragic war past, which is shallowly explored via his commander, who ends up chatting with him once, and that's it. He's probably the least interesting of the trio, but at least, he ends up being the crux of some of the better comedy moments of the first 3 episodes. \n\nButch Cassidy and the other Drifters are infinitely less interesting, but he is easily the most tolerable of them (along with The Sundance Kid for how little he shows up), with him actually doing some cool stuff. Sure, Naoshi takes down some dragons in a WWII plane, but he's just there to provide some refreshing amounts of swearing, which ends up becoming excessive. There is also Count Saint-Germi (the son of Hitler) with his coup d'etat scheme, and his annoying posse (Alester and Flemi), but they are mostly there to be annoying and provide bad comedy until the count himself starts that plan with the Drifters to overthrow the human government.\n\nThe Octobrists are overall very uninteresting, except for Olmine, who is constantly made fun of for her voluptuous breasts, but has some genuinely great interactions with Toyo, as he shows her some good chivalry and allows her to use her spells to great effect in the latter half of the series. She is literally the only remotely interesting Octobrist. As for the Ends, with exception of The Black King, all of them are as plain as they come (with the slight exception of Anastasia, who is barely in this show). Then, they (except for Anestasia and Rasputin) get their backstories to explain why they are so evil and a bit about how that ties in with their powers (Only Joan of Arc does. Gilles de Rais and Hijikata doesn't get anything relating to his powers, and nobody gets their power origins outright explained) in a poor attempt at making these lame characters come off as tragic, which is really horrible given their real-life counterparts. \n\nThe Black King is an interesting figure, wanting better civilization for the demi-humans, and being able to create food as well as grow cells (to regenerate, but also to harm, as shown with the Bronze Dragon in episode 10), but even with his somewhat interesting motivations and enigmatic figure, he can't really make up for how bland his subordinates are. Easy is the one who sends the bad guys in, is moody, and that's about it aside from having a cutesy and girly room to herself. Murasaki is even more bland, though. Overall, despite a few characters that grew to be legitimately interesting and compelling, the cast is stupidly bland at best, and irritating at worst.\n\nHoods Drifters Studio (not to get confused with Hoods Entertainment, though they may or may not be affiliated) is brand new to this game, and they did a really good job with their first series, which is, of course, this. As if to make up for the writing quality, the action is refreshingly brutal, with loads of decapitation and blood, and no censorship anywhere. It's pretty fun seeing how much of a chaotic gore-fest the action scenes are, and they detail some of the bullet moments and impacts very well. The character models, while looking similar to Kouta Hirano's most popular work, Hellsing Ultimate, they also feel realistic and sorta unique. The only problem I have isn't with the art-stye change during most of the comedy moments, but rather with the usage of CGI for the dragons and some of the soldiers. They try to cover it up and make it work with everything, but it doesn't really help much, as it looks awkward. Luckily, that problem is barely present in the second half. Some moments in the earlier episodes are a bit off though. Still, I really hope to see this studio grow since they did such an impressive job with their first project.\n\nI don't have such high praises for the music, sadly. Gospel of the Throttle (by Minutes 'Til Midnight), the OP of the series, doesn't fit the show as well as I wish. On its own, it's a slick piece, but I don't feel it works here. Luckily, the ED, Vermillion (by Maon Kurosaki) is a very good song, with a more epic and buildup heavy feel to it that really fits with how gruesome and heavy the show can be. The rest of the OST isn't memorable or worthwhile at all, save for one ok piece. The dub is pretty alright. No major hiccups here, but nothing spectacular in terms of performances. It's a relatively solid dub so far. \n\nHonestly, despite how cool and refreshing the action scenes were, this show kinda left me feeling bored and annoyed every now and then, especially in the first half. I admit, the action is fun, and some moments were definitely bleak, the horrible tone-shifts really leave me dazed and confused, and completely taken out of the experience, which is horrible given that one of these moments take place immediately after the darkest moment of the show! If not for the cool action, this wouldn't have engaged me at all, especially since the first 3 episodes left me with the feeling of darkness-induced apathy. I nearly dropped it during those first 3 episodes and even then, outside of fight scenes, this show is still very boring at times. Plus, not a lot of the gags make me laugh, but at least some of them do.\n\nUnfortunately, while this is a very gruesome action show and some of the gags get a laugh here and there, this show is a tonal mess that's hard to care about on any level that isn't related to primal, epic bloodbaths. At the very least, I hope that this series ends up bringing some notoriety for Hoods Drifters Studio. Still, this show is a bit of a disappointment.

Their lives quickly become intertwined as the sins of his past start to take notice and haunt him once more. Can these three kindred spirits get along with each other long enough to help Yato realize his ambitions in the spiritual hierarchy, or will simply surviving turn out to be a tough enough challenge on it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own?\n\nimg660(http://fanaru.com/noragami/image/29605-noragami-noragami.jpg)\n\nNoragami was animated by the once famous Studio Bones, and while it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not their best looking work, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably their best looking recent work. There is a budget disparity, because this is Bones and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always a budget disparity, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relatively well managed. While there is a good chunk of action throughout the story, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a very dialogue heavy series full of character-banter and exposition. The budget gets cut during these scenes, which is generally the ideal way to go about it unnoticed. In exchange for this, the action scenes have a great flow to them, the comedic scenes can use just enough movement to give them the energy they need, and guys, the spirits that Yato and his friends have to fight are just resplendent.\n\nThe character designs are simple and a little on the generic side, utilizing templates that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve no doubt seen in many modern anime. They do their job well enough, but the only thing that sets them apart from the norm are a few unique touches that were added to their outfits and the attractive design of their eyes. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re bland looking in any way, but there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much visual flare to any of them. The backgrounds and environments are highly detailed and richly colored, but in keeping to form with the character designs, this is nothing you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen before. The exception to this is in their highly expressive faces, which are versatile enough on their own to distract you from the few times that a key frame lingers on screen for a few seconds too long.\n\nThe music, on the other hand, is a lot more original and inspired. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t notice it for the most part\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Not because it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there, but because it was doing it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job well\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But the few tracks I did notice were the kind that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have no problem playing in my car, thanks to the diverse compositions of Taku Iwasaki. Most of the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more noticeable tunes are blends of rock and traditional Japanese music with contemporary styles like drum and base and techno, creating a unique sound that helps to elevate the series beyond the general aimlessness of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story. Blood pumping music makes for good action, and a good beat is essential for making it work. The beat on most of these tracks tracks is so good that you may catch yourself nodding your head and tapping your foot in time with it.\n\nEven outside of the opening and closing, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a surprising amount of vocal work in the background music. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rapping in these songs\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Yes, it surprised me too, not just by how good it sounds but the fact that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s there at all. Straight up rapping, and if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not unusual enough, there are also a lot of instances\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Especially in the tune Noratan\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 That use vocals as if a person were shouting random sounds into a megaphone rather than singing them, and it all comes together really well. This is a series that blends classic Japanese mythology with modern styles and attitudes, and while it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nowhere near the first anime to do this, it is the only one I can think of that used an equally anachronistic music style, and it fits the series perfectly. The opening, Goya no Machiawase by Hello Sleepwalkers, is a little more standard than the rest of the soundtrack, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still on the high end of the scale. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a soundtrack that shines with effort and inspiration over-all, and it sounds just as good whether out of context or in context.\n\nThe recently released English dub was a Funimation endeavor, and with the Japanese being such a solid blend of comedy and drama, they had quite a bit to live up to\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But Funimation has proven themselves before, and with Bonny Clinkenbeard behind the wheel, they prove it once again. Brynn Appril plays the lead role of Hiyori, the quirky high-schooler who gets caught up in this whole mess, and boy does her voice get a work-out. Between having to scream whenever her character over-reacts to something(which is a thing that happens a lot) and lecturing her new friend over his behavior, or just singing to herself over her new-found powers, she never recites a single line without amping up the emotion behind it. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the cornerstone of the chemistry that these three possess, and Brynn does a great job upholding it.\n\nThen again, so do her costars, Jason Leibricht and Micah Solusod. Their performances are just as animated as hers, if not moreso during their stronger moments. As the down-on-his luck Yato, Liebricht really does sound like a guy holding onto hope and trying to enjoy his life despite the huge weight hanging over him, and the dark past that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supposedly put behind him. Micah Solusad goes on more of a journey than the other two, following the spirit Yukine as he tries to make do with his situation, although never shying away from openly criticizing the boss he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been saddled with. He keeps it together, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clearly a struggle, and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 As they say\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Something\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gotta give, and when it does, he breaks through as the star of this dub. Alexis Tipton as Kofuku is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Alexis Tipton. Which is a good thing.\n\nNoragami gets off to a great start. It introduces us to a very interesting universe and a strong premise revolving around the ambitious but heavily flawed Yato, and his two friends who are just likable as he is, and through them, we get to explore the intricacies of this spiritual society existing just out of reach of normal human acknowledgement. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of potential in these early episodes, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen a lot of people say that it sort of drops the ball after that point. In a way, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m inclined to agree, as once everything\u00e2\u0080\u0099s laid out on the table, well, Noragami does lose start to show some cracks.\n\nFirst of all, it kind of can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be ignored\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 This series is based heavily on Japanese mythology, and it makes the mistake of assuming the viewer is familiar with that kind of material. A lot of the details of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s universe are mentioned without any explanation or build-up, and while those in the know will be able to understand the context of those details enough to not question how it works, most American viewers will likely treat each piece of it with a raised eyebrow and, at best, an \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you say so\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d kind of response.\n\nSee, in order to do his job, Yato needs the aid of a shinki, or\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 In the dub\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 A Regalia. He takes the spirit of Yukine as his regalia, and can turn him into a weapon whenever necessary (See Soul Eater for more on this concept). For those of us who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t regularly study Japanese mythology, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll hear something like \u00e2\u0080\u009cA God will start to deteriorate if their regalia misbehaves, and their deterioration can be caught by other Gods like a flesh eating bacteria,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d respond to this with a blank stare. It fits together about as well as saying that \u00e2\u0080\u0098once the human population reaches one million, the moon will blow us up.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Yeah, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re along for the ride, but it kind of wrecks the immersion of the experience.\n\nA lot of the details are explained to us through Hiyori\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sad to say is her main job in the series\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But it rarely ever goes any deeper than just \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is how this works, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry about the logic of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You could say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my fault for not being worldly enough to get it, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always been a strong believer in accessibility. You shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to study to understand what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on in a story. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say an anime with rich cultural subtext shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t inspire people to seek out more information about said culture, but you should still be mindful of those who haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t or even won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve criticized much better shows than this one for their accessibility issues, and I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be giving any quarter over it today.\n\nFollowing the halfway point, the series loses it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sense of direction, as well as any interest it may have had in Yato\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pursuit of higher godhood. Concepts brought up during the first half are dropped entirely, enemies from his past reappear in the story out of nowhere\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Like, seriously, one of them just happens to show up because one of Hiyori\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friends prays to him offhand at a shrine\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And the stakes drop rapidly to the point that the only thing Yato\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really fighting for is the one thing that works the best in the series; His friendship with Hiyori and Yukine.\n\nAnd speaking of Hiyori, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of a pitiful main character. My plot summary focused mainly on Yato because he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot more interesting than she is, and she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really become important to the plot until episode 10. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likable, and she gets a few laughs in the early episodes, but she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never really given an identity beyond that point, other than being the glue of their friendship. While the idea of her leaving her body behind whenever she goes spirity comes off as funny at first, they do so little with it, and the fact that her lifeless body has been sitting out in public for extended periods of time is just swept under the rug. She leaves her body outside in the rain for over a full episode, and when she gets it back, she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a cold or anything.\n\nWhile I can understand people saying that the first half was a lot stronger than the second half, I would like to respectfully disagree. I took issue with this series as early as the third episode, and found myself hating it throughout the fourth episode, and my feeling has a lot to do with it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attitude towards depression and suicide. See, in the world of Noragami, people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t decide to commit suicide on their own\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 A malicious spirit attaches itself to people who are experiencing negative emotions and pushes them towards expressing it through extreme methods.\n\nNow, an immediate defense for this might be \u00e2\u0080\u009cIsn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that how the witches in Madoka Magika work?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Well, no. The witches in Madoka Magika use suicide as a weapon, but they attack indiscriminately against anybody in the area. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not the sole cause of suicide, they just utilize it. In Noragami, Yato states twice in episode three alone that if a soul wants to kill itself, then it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being possessed. Unless this is a translation error\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Which I doubt\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Noragami openly blames suicide(And murder, and even bullying) on spiritual possession.\n\nOn the one hand, you could say that possession is a metaphor for depression, that an undeniable force is taking control of you and urging you towards things you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to do. And yeah, that metaphor kind of adds up, save for two serious problems. First of all, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a situation that can conveniently be solved by simply killing or exorcising the offending demon. This throws the metaphor argument directly under the bus, as even if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able to stop a depressed person from killing themselves, depression is not that easy to cure. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a complicated illness with countless possible catalysts, and to imply that they can all be erased by getting rid of that pesky negative feeling is just insulting. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a metaphor.  It's an over-simplification, and a stupid one at that.\n\nNoragami didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t set out to belittle a lot of peoples\u00e2\u0080\u0099 real life problems\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I know that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intention, and demonic possession isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the worst way to explore it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been done, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been done well. The problem is that this show just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show any evidence of understanding the topic it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dealing with. For the perfect example, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an extensive scene in episode 4 where Yato & Friends are accidentally dialed by a man who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s jumping off of a building. Throughout what must be the longest fall in history(Seriously, you could do your taxes before hitting the ground), he tells them that he fell in love with a young woman and from then onwards, he had worse and worse luck resulting in his business failing and going bankrupt. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revealed that he was dating the goddess of poverty, so Yato severs his connection to said Goddess, saves him from the fall, and then\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Eureka, everything\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resolved!\n\nExcept no, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not. They haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t solved his financial problems, nor have they rid him of the hard times and deep shame that clearly came with it, so there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no saying whether or not he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try to die again. Also, his cruel sociopath of a woman gets off easy just because she thought what she was doing to him was funny. No, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry, they haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t undone the damage that was done to him, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never going to target anybody ever again. And this is one of my biggest problems with Noragami\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 By defeating these spirits, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not helping anybody, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just putting a band-aid on a wound that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to reopen again, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just stopping there. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going through, or how much you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re suffering\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Just as long as you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t resort to any methods that\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make people sad!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nYeah, I know this has some kind of ties to Japanese beliefs, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another Eastern belief that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like apply to this; If you save somebody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re responsible for that life. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not Japanese, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still relevant. Now that proverb may have many meanings, but in this case, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to use it as meaning that if you step in and prevent them from committing suicide, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve become involved in their struggle. You have just taken away their way out, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d better be damn well ready to show them another way out, otherwise you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just pushing your belief on other people to preserve your own sensibilities. In Noragami, the idea seems to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cNope, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not gonna die\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Good luck!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And to me, that seems just as irresponsible as not doing anything.\n\nSo, with all of these problems that I had with Noragami, is it a bad show? Nope! It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two strongest elements, thankfully. take up the majority of the series. The first is the action, which\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 While poorly set up through rushed villains\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Is freaking awesome, whether your brain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s turned off or on. The animation never really looks bad, but these fight scenes are where the budget shines through gloriously, and while the villains may have had writing issues, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all a lot of fun. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re well designed and intimidating, and they have compelling motives that are tied to Yato\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dark past, which is a really smart way to grow him as a character\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 By showing him literally battling against his past sins.\n\nAnd the second is the relationship between Yato and his Regalia, Yukine. Their dynamic is very effective at holding up their separate yet still intertwined arcs. Yato brought Yukine back to life in order to use him as a tool to help him get back on his feet and maybe even restore his long lost glory. He thinks of him as an object, needing to follow orders and obey his beck and call. Yukine hates this, and rebels almost immediately, acting out in ways that damage Yato. Yato has to learn how to be fair and treat his Regalia like a person, and Yukine needs to learn to accept his fate and respect the one who gave him his second chance.\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very parent/child sort of dynamic, and it works really well because nether character is fully in the wrong, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re both acting in relatable, understandable ways. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve all been to that place where we resent somebody for disrespecting us and taking our generosity for granted. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve all been in places where we felt disgruntled over situations that were forced upon us without our consent, and yes, some dark part of us wanted to see other people suffer what we have to suffer. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very well-developed conflict, and with Hiyori acting as the glue between them, we never have to wonder why Yukine doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just quit the way Yato\u00e2\u0080\u0099s previous Regalia did. In fact, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be perfectly honest, I liked the second half of this series more than the first half, simply because it spent so much time on these two aspects of the series that I enjoyed the most.\n\nimg660(https://moesucks.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/noragami-1204.jpg)\n\nNoragami is available from Funimation. At the time of this writing, you can find it on Amazon in the DVD/Bluray combo pack format for just over half of the original price. You can also find it on Funimation.com and Amazon Instant Video, and the undubbed subtitled version is available on Netflix. The original manga IS available stateside from Kodansha comics USA, and from what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard, it tells a much more complete story than the series does. A second season is scheduled to air in Japan in October, and from the summaries I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve read, it will be following the story of one of Yato\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enemies, a blonde woman with an eyepatch named Bishamonten.\n\nNoragami is a somewhat problematic show, suffering from issues on almost every level, but the product as a whole is worth more than the sum of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parts. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interested in Japanese mythology, then its world-building makes it out to be a decent introduction to the subject. The inconsistency of the writing kind of works in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favor, as it tends to give up on the things it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing wrong and focuses most of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time on the things it does right, for better or worse. Personally, I did enjoy the good parts of it enough to watch it a second or maybe even third time in the future, although I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll probably be skipping episode four when I do so. Combining that with some solid animation and the most interesting soundtrack I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard in years, I give Noragami a 6/10."}, {"id": 3397, "score": 60, "body": "In the distant future, with the concept of recorded time itself having become irrelevant, the world as we know it has changed. The land is a vast desert, society has been pushed to the brink of existence, and mankind is no longer the dominant species. As the result of a great war, the world has been taken over by beastmen, a race of humanoid creatures that range from beings who look like normal humans with random animal features, to full-bodied anthropomorphic bipedal animals of varying heights. As wacky as that idea may sound, the oppression of the human race is anything but, as humanity has been designated a race of second class citizens, with some settlements killing us on sight, others enslaving us or simply refusing to acknowledging us, and the areas where we can exist as equals being few and far between. On top of all this, the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s oceans have somehow vanished with time, replaced with a literal sea of sand, where aquatic creatures have adapted to swimming through the earth itself, and terrestrial life forms having to ride boats across the vast sandscape.\n\nThe wars between mankind and the beastmen have left countless casualties in their wake, but none have had as much impact as the death of the idealistic Revi, a young man with a vision to create a world of harmony and prosperity. Upon his death, however, his older sister Morte manages to come into possession of a legendary device called The Destruct Code, a device with the power to end the world. Mourning her loss and wishing to end the unfair world that took Revi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life, this one girl will set out on a quest to find out how to use the Destruct Code to make her own desire a reality. On the way, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll team up with a nomadic human cook named Kyrie and a strong willed Dwarf Bear beastman named Taupy, with the three of them unwittingly adopting the moniker of The World Destruction Committee, officially labeling them as enemies of the people, highly wanted criminals among beastmen and humanity alike. With their epic quest unfolding, and the mysteries of The Destruct Code unraveling, who the fuck are we supposed to be rooting for here?\n\nimg660(https://thanksforyourplaying.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/sands-of-destruction.jpg)\n\nVisually speaking, this show isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anything special to write home about. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not terrible looking, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also not great looking. The only thing noteworthy about it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s animation is that it was produced by Production IG, whom I used to have a really high pinion of before I started taking a closer look at their resume. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve put out a ton of great looking titles throughout the years making up a cozy majority of their output, but there are a few clunky looking titles peppered throughout the list. From what I can tell, it looks like they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t allocate high budgets to any project that they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think people are going to pursue for their visuals... Titles like Cromartie high school, which is mostly renowned for it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comedy, and Chevalier D\u00e2\u0080\u0099eon, which would mostly be popular for it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s writing and sophisticated Elizabethan tone. They must have thought the same about Sands of Destruction, with their assumption being that since it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s based on a video game, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market would only extend to fans of said game.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give them this, from what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen, none of their anime titles have looked bad over-all, even if there have been some bad looking moments in them. Sands of Destruction definitely looks cheap, though, and it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take a lot of viewing to pick up on this. At worst, there are a couple of moments in the first few episodes where they ran into frameless action or just had really long scenes involving still character images talking to each other, but thankfully moments like this aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the norm. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d honestly say the worst thing about the visuals is the setting, as in accordance to the premise, a huge chunk of the series run time is spent with the cast riding their boats out on the sand sea(which I never got used to), which granted the animators an opportunity to feature long, static talking and interaction segments against an easy to manage background, which was no doubt a huge budget saver, but for the audience, the novelty of seeing that sand sea in the first place was the only thing visually interesting about these scenes.\n\nDifferent areas that our cast visit and their interiors have a much more interesting look to them, which is kind of a give-away when you consider that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re traveling from area to area, like the cast of One Piece. The different settlements across their home land are highly diverse and offer a lot of diverse set pieces, so that even if the characters are just talking to each other without doing much moving, you can still enjoy the surprisingly detailed artwork that serves as their backdrop. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a massive library in one episode, and while the plethora of books don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look incredibly diverse, the shadows and cobwebs still give the area a sense of identity as an old, worn down family business. Right in the first episode, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re introduced to Taupy as he drinks in a bar, and what a bar! The background in that scene is beautifully lit, offering a surreal glow around those standing in front of it. Also, I mentioned that the sandy backgrounds didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t offer much to be desired, but the creatures inhabiting the sands, when you get to see them, are pretty cool.\n\nThe character designs were taken straight from the game, as I understand it, and they seem competent enough. Most of the main cast is designed to type, with certain elements of their aesthetic informing their personality, like how Kyrie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ruffled hair is just wild enough to maybe be a main character, but at the same time just subdued enough to be written as a sidekick, with his blonde hair and friendly, innocent eyes painting his good nature that the very act of altering them slightly could set up a more sinister change. Morte, the heroine, is red-haired and busty, with an outfit that carefully straddles the line between conservative and fetishy, and of course, one of their enemies has long white hair. More interesting are their friend Taupy, a dwarf bear, who looks like he was created by a pirate enthusiast at Build a Bear Workshop, and then you have Lia, whose design fits her as the most interesting and entertaining person in the show, as she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just overdesigned enough to suit how funny she is. What I actually found disappointing was the race of beastmen, who you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d think would be the epicenter of imagination and possibilities, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just anthropomorphic animals and people with animal parts. Princess Tutu did more with animal/human hybrids than this show does.\n\nThe music in Sands of Destruction is way cooler than it has any business being, and far more fun to listen to on it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own than as a part of the series. Yoshihiro Ike is a seasoned veteran in the field of anime music, and I honestly don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think this series deserves his talent, but since they were able to land him, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad they put him to such good use. honestly, it kind of depresses me that with the show being as obscure as it is, nobody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely to hear it a solid decade later. Even outside of instrumentation and tune, the sound quality alone is beyond impressive. Most of you reading this probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ever watch Sands of Destruction, but at the very least, look up the track Yoru no Houmonsha, for a taste of just how rich and complex this music is. Having said that, the opening leaves something to be desired, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visuals are a bit clunky and jarringly inconsistent, and the tune... Particularly the sting at the beginning... Create a promise of edginess and grit that the series fails laughably to follow up on.\n\nThe English dub is a Funimation effort, and since it came out around the turn of the decade, it makes sense that they went with two of their safest options for the lead roles. Everybody loves Luci Christian and Todd Haberkorn, especially when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing their normal shtick, right? They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re recognizable voices, usually strong performers, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re both really popular, so it made sense to put them here. And yeah, they do solid jobs, so I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really take anything away from them there, even if their casting doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel inspired at all. Luci has a lock on playing strong female characters, especially ones who have red hair... Has anyone else noticed that? She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s able to dial up the necessary drama and tragedy, and even the occasional comedy, whenever she needs to. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never really understood what people see(Or hear, I guess) in Todd Haberkorn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nasally voice, but when he raises his pitch, he can play likeable little-brother type characters really well. And like I said before, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a solid actor in general.\n\nLeaving the human characters for a moment, there are two actors who had to play tough, hardened warriors in the form of small Teddy bears, and the fact that they were able to do this without cracking up or breaking character is a testament to their professionalism and dedication to their craft. Christopher Sabat may have only appeared in one episode, but lending his growling, deathly serious tough-guy routine to the tiny Yappy instantly elevates him to the top of the pack, at least for this show. Robert McCullom, who I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever talked about before, takes a slightly lighter approach to the main character Taupy, also a tiny bear, but where his old friend has turned from the path of justice, Taupy still carries a touch of innocence inside of him, which his actor is great at bringing out. My favorite performer in this dub is probably Trina Nishimura, who plays Lia, a descendant of Dragon beastmen, and since her character is an overzealous and easily angered loose canon, she has way too much fun with her. Beyond these names, the cast is saturated with well known Funimation names, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an okay dub in general.\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not overtly obvious throughout the series that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s based on a video game, but once you do hear that piece of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s background, it does explain a lot. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never played Sands of Destruction for the Nintendo DS, but from what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the kind of final Fantasy inspired game that starts off promising, but eventually loses it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focus and crumbles under it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own weight. to be fair, that does seem like something the anime went through, but only at the very end, and to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s credit, it only happens very briefly. More to the point, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s video game origin does explain a lot about it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story structure and pace, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a show about a small party of misfits from different walks of life who travel all over the map to accomplish a vaguely stated goal relating to the end of the world. There are times when it does feel like a video game speedrun, except with all the grinding, random encounters and puzzle-solving cut out to tell just the story on it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own merits, and while it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not impossible to tell a good story like that, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good reason why not many franchises ever try it.\n\nFor one thing, the most important element of any game is the actual gameplay, which is where the majority of the focus during production should go. Gameplay isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just a string of endless fights and challenges, it endears you to characters. It gets you invested in them. It drives the story, as the character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s struggles become more personal to you. Free exploration is a fantastic way of developing lore and dumping exposition, things that are difficult to do in scripted media. With the element of gameplay removed, media based on games has been almost universally bad to a laughable degree, even in regard to some anime adaptations, and when a game has as little actual depth as Sands of Destruction, that lack of gameplay is a compensation to make. Thus, this series is puddle deep even at the best of times, being incredibly shallow in both it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s characters, with no real themes or ideas to play around with, nothing really engaging going on at any given time, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s few flashes of emotional resonance being exactly that... Nothing but the briefest of flashes.\n\nAll of this could have been a huge issue, making it a dull, boring slog the likes of Ragnarok the Animation, if it was to make the mistake of taking itself seriously, but thank God, Sands of Destruction was able to dodge that bullet. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to say this series doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try, or doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put in any effort, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s extremely light-hearted, which is a life-saver in terms of watchability. It embraces it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weirdness, explores the ramifications and implications of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s universe in ways that are straight forward while at the same time delightfully tongue-in-cheek, and it plays the \u00e2\u0080\u0098sea of sand, how bizarre is that\u00e2\u0080\u0099 card at every opportunity. Very early on, I thought about how darkly funny it would be to see one of these sand ships get stuck under...sand, with the crew having to face the threat of drowning in sand, and while I was just being a dick at the time, you better believe they actually go that route in one episode. No character is ever allowed to point out how ridiculous these kind of occurrences are, but the audience is highly encouraged to try and wrap their heads around it, and I respect that kind of approach to weirdness.\n\nBut the biggest asset that Sands of Destruction has is it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cast of characters, and the dynamic between them. To be clear, none of them are any deeper than your common golfing divot, but our heroes, our stock characters and even a few of the villains are still all fun and interesting to some degree. As I alluded in my plot synopsis, the main cast is on a quest to destroy the world, which almost instantly makes their enemies likeable, as they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on our side, trying to save the world. Even our heroes, in spite of this, are still effective because of their motives. Morte has a reason to want to end the world, and while it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make much logical sense, it makes perfect sense from an emotional perspective, and of course she grows to be conflicted as she nears her goal. Her friends stick with her because... Well, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re her friends. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been lumped in with her as criminals through circumstance, and they really have nowhere else to go, so they support her, they stick with her, and they just kinda hope she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll change her mind.\n\nAnd I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this sense of camaraderie that keeps me coming back to the series. Despite the apocalyptic premise, I like seeing this collection of friends on their journey, all of them genuinely caring about and supporting each other, even though one of them wants to inadvertently kill all three of them. And while the tone of the series may be entirely laid back, there are still several touching scenes and moments, from the conclusion of the cherry blossoms episode to Morte\u00e2\u0080\u0099s temporary connection to the beastmen working in his family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bookstore, it has the ability to pull heartstrings, at least on a small scale. It does sort of foul this up towards the end, with a series of huge reveals taking the story in kind of an unnecessarily dark direction, but like I said before, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brief, and it ultimately builds towards a fairly decent conclusion that only flirts with pretentious misanthropy, instead of going all the way with it like Morte\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character kind of suggested it might. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lighter, looser kind of adventure, and I suggest checking it out at least once.\n\nimg660(https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-E2XBUBOwHRg/Vs-M0fuoXKI/AAAAAAAAGN8/NngKJdNTEGQ/s1600/elr%253Bqkgmelrkqgmerql%253Bkgmerlk%253Bmerl%253Bkhmrel%253Bkmherql%253Bkhmerqlk%253Bhmreql%253Bkhmerql%253Bhmerql%253Bhkmer.png)\n\nSands of Destruction is available from Funimation as part of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s SAVE collection, which makes it really easy to find and really cheap. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say the same for the game it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s based on, as even a used cartridge, on it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own, can run you around thirty dollars. The manga, by ASCII Media works, is not available stateside.\n\nI wish I could say that this anime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obscurity is unjustified, or that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some forgotten gem that must be seen and appreciated for it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brilliance, but I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t honestly have that much to offer outside of some weird spectacle and an all-around pleasant and inoffensive experience. I definitely like it, but I could also definitely live the rest of my life without ever seeing it again, sad though that may sound. At the very least, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surprisingly good by the standards of video game adaptations... I mean, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a much more enjoyable experience than something like Xenosaga the animation... So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of a miracle in how it stacks up to other titles of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ilk, but as an island, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pretty forgettable show. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for a cheap, light-hearted and easily digestable action show, you could do a lot worse. I give Sands of Destruction a 6/10."}, {"id": 3405, "score": 50, "body": "Throughout time, many legends have been told about the mighty samurai\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Warriors of honor, loyally serving their masters, as well as lone Ronin, serving only to uphold the values they hold true, whether they be religious or personal. Around these parts, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll hear tales of one such Ronin, a bad ass motherfucker who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as silent as the grave and twice as terrifying. This man knows no love, no empathy, and no tears. He invites no trouble, and will offer no mercy to those stupid enough to give it to him. He knows few pleasures, save for the warmth of a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body, the refreshing tang of a cool glass of lemonade, and the sweet, sweet flavor of revenge. Rumor has it he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even need to eat\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 That the blood of his enemies, which constantly bathes the blade of his sword, provides him all the nourishment he could ever need. I myself have no idea which rumors are true and which ones are just the product of fear, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got no intention of finding out, but there is a bounty on his head\u00e2\u0080\u00a6  Care to collect?\n\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll know this young Samurai when you see him, as he sports an afro\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 A rare hair style indeed, and one that will surely become his sigul long after he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s departed our world, if he ever does. But don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry, traveler, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no need to fear this man\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, unless you have what he wants. Otherwise, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be perfectly willing to live and let live. See, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve probably heard tell about the headbands\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Trophies only the mightiest of samurai are able to carry, and the only way to obtain one is to spill the blood of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s previous owner. Well, this Afro Samurai is carrying the #2 headband, which\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 If you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t guess\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Is the second most prestigious headband in the known world, and the only one that grants it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s user the right to challenge the greatest samurai currently living, the holder of the #1 headband. And you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hear this from me, dear traveler, but the Afro Samurai\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drive to challenge this man isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t based on mere ambition, but something much more personal. He fights not for glory, or for honor\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But for revenge.\n\nUnlike most anime, Afro Samurai was the product of an international collaboration. Studio Gonzo was interested in adapting the deeply personal work of Takashi Okazaki, a manga artist who had been influenced by his love of both samurai classics and African American culture, particularly in regard to rap and R&B. He was shy at first, and probably wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have signed over the rights if not for the encouragement and participation of American actor Samuel L Jackson, who had gotten his hands on a rare action figure based on Okazaki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s illustrations, and had become obsessed with seeing the project through. Jackson and Okazaki apparently connected instantly, language barriers be damned, and the project went ahead, albeit with what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m told was a 1 million dollar budget.\n\nFor an American cartoon, that sort of budget for a five episode series is abysmal, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that generous for an anime, either, despite the fact that anime is universally cheaper than it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s western counterparts. For Afro Samurai, this meant that each episode could only cost less than twenty thousand dollars, and that meant they had to cut a lot of corners\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Which they did, brilliantly I might add, by turning the cheapness they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been cursed with into a highly appealing visual style that incorporates the absolute best out of all the budget saving tactics you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen before. It never quite falls back on the time old talking heads, at least not to the point that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d ever notice it, but when movement is limited, the beautifully detailed artwork is more than sufficient to keep your eyes glued to the screen.\n\nTo be completely honest, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen an anime\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Well, any animation, really\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Get this much mileage out of such a limited color palette. There are occasional splashes of color throughout the series, especially when it comes to the buckets full of red blood and the golden glow of our hero\u00e2\u0080\u0099s precious lemonade, but for about 90 percent of the series, the colors on screen are almost monochromatic, playing with numerous shades of white, black and gray, as well as the occasional tan of the ground. At night, the cloudy, overcast sky is a captivating sight, and during the day, the lighting effects are beyond gorgeous. Other visual effects such as rain and fog filters are integrated smoothly with the cell-drawn animation.\n\nThe real triumph here are the action scenes, which are fast, fluid and dynamic, even when the animators have to break a character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anatomical frame in order to keep the pace up. It only takes one real glance to see this kind of animation style in motion, as Afro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s namesake blows in the wind like the reflection of the moon in a puddle, and the animators are not shy about letting an occasional arm or leg move with exactly the same level of consistency. It winds up working out better than you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d think not only because of sharp, fast editing, but because the sound design of every single sword movement is completely on point. I love all of the action scenes in this series, but a few easy highlights are an early fight where Afro splits a bullet with his sword, a huge bloodbath of a brawl from when he was a teenager that almost feels like Saving Private Ryan in the way it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brutality is show to effect him, and of course, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a fight towards the end where he takes on a robot who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been designed to look and fight like he does, but has no problem taking Afro to the sky with it when those tactics don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pan out.\n\nAs you may have guessed from Okazaki and Jackson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s connection that I mentioned earlier, the music in Afro Samurai is made up mostly of hip-hop, full of vocal tracks whose head-banging beats fit the pace of the action in a way that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easily similar to The Boondocks. The vocal work was performed by RZA, a former member of the Wu-Tang clan, a band that was, in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own right, influenced by Eastern culture. He also produced much of the music, as he did for his former band. The instrumental tracks feature slightly more traditional orchestration, but they fit more to the background, humbly doing their job without standing out too much. Besides, why bother making the instrumentals stand out when you have tracks featuring The Game, Too Short, Snoop Dogg and more, which are guaranteed to leave an impression all by themselves? The soundtrack, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re lucky enough to have it, features a small handful of tracks that weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t from the show but inspired by it, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean \u00e2\u0080\u0098inspired by\u00e2\u0080\u0099 like all the bullshit tracks on the Pokemon Movie soundtrack\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 These are songs that actually fit the series.\n\nThe English dub is a very unique entity, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comprised almost entirely of actors who work in traditional animation. or \u00e2\u0080\u009cPre-lay.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This is a term referring to the practice of recording a voice actor first and then animating a character around them afterwards, as opposed to ADR voice acting, which does the opposite. Thankfully, they translate very well over to the more prevalent Anime recording style, although there are minor lip-flapping hiccups from time to time. The only anime regular who appears in this dub is Yuri Lowenthal, who plays Afro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s childhood friend, Ginno, who was an idealistic young boy in Afro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past, but is even more compelling in the present day scenes, due to certain spoiler reasons. He does an outstanding job, probably the best performance in the dub, but because of a certain other big name, he was never the one I was going to get excited over.\n\nNo matter how much hype went into the American airing of the series\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And yes, the hype was palpable\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The truth was, regardless of the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success, I was going to watch it either way because of one of the names attached to it. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the most underrated actors of our time, in my opinion, and as much as I enjoy his live action work, I practically chomp at the bit when I get a chance to hear him in a cartoon, or even in the rare video game, and I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t resist the opportunity to hear him in an anime. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not only my favorite black actor, or my favorite voice actor, no, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my favorite ACTOR, period. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been following him since BEFORE what many would consider his most memorable role in Pulp Fiction, and his inclusion made this dub for me. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m talking about Phil Lamarr, the original voice actor for Samurai Jack, who once again returned to the genre as the young version of Afro, as well as one of the Brothers, a league of elderly assassins including such prolific actors as Jeff Bennet and John Dimaggio!\n\nOh, you thought I was talking about Samuel L Jackson? He did a fine job. I wish I could say more, but as a main character, he had relatively little to do or say throughout the series. The titular character Afro is a very soft-spoken character, choosing only to speak when necessary, letting his actions do the speaking for him unless he has no other choice. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not really Jackson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fault, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not really an acting-heavy role, but he still does an admirable job with it. Thankfully he has dual roles, as he gets a lot more lines as the mysterious Ninja Ninja, a loud-mouthed tag-a-long who appears to Afro the minute he earns the #2 headband properly. The true identity of Ninja Ninja is never openly revealed, nor is it stated until the final episode whether or not he exists at all. While his endless jabbering is welcome most of the time, breaking up long periods of silence and questioning Afro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motives, he can become annoying with his knack for stating the obvious. Think of him like\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 D\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand from Vampire Hunter D.\n\nThe other two high-billed names are Kelly Hu and Ron Perlman, though neither one really appears enough to justify having featured names. Outside of flashbacks, Kelly Hu only appears in one episode as a shrine maiden who takes Afro in when he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s near death, and nurses him back to health\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Using both medical AND sexual healing to see him through. Kelly exaggerates her accent with this character, which I guess is fitting, because she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the only definitely-asian characters in the cast. Ron Perlman is unrecognizable as the main villain, Justice, who only appears in the first and last episodes, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mostly because he hisses his lines like a snake, playing up how misanthropic and morally bankrupt this #1 samurai has allowed his time in the top to make him, as well as highlighting his delusional, god-like ambitions. If there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a problem with this dub, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably in the fact that some of the Brothers, played by veteran voice actors though they may be, are performed as though they were southern evangelical priests, a bafflingly poor fit for the tone of the series.\n\nYou wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be unjustified in saying that Afro Samurai had a very weak story. Despite all that happens in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s five episode run, little to none of it seems to matter in the long run. Afro gets into fights that are resolved as easily as possible, and then moves on afterward, as if nothing had happened at all. This is because, at it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core, Afro Samurai is the very simple story about a surprisingly simple man. While we do get generous doses of flashbacks to explain who he is and why he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing, you really wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lose anything important to the plot if you just told his backstory, and then cut directly to Afro standing at the gates of his final enemy. Even at five episodes, this anime could have been reduced to one, or two at the most, with nothing you would need to know lost in the process. The story does not see actual progress very often, and neither does Afro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s journey, as he himself sees little to no development, at least if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t count his childhood and teenage years in the flashbacks. This has become a major criticism of the series, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one I feel I should address.\n\nOne of my favorite movies of 2013 was 2 Guns, a more-or-less by the numbers action film that featured both Denzel Washington and Mark Walberg as undercover agents from two separate factions pretending to be friends to investigate each other, constantly fighting together and backstabbing each other as the story progresses. I say that, but the story for the most part was an incoherent mess. There were so many betrayals and plot twists that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure even the writers knew what was going on, so why did I love it so much? The answer lies in the execution, and what the movie brought to the table that worked. The insane story was made palatable by the sharp, clever dialogue and the chemistry between the two leads, and it ended in such a way that it was able to embrace it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s insanity\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Where else am I ever going to see a shoot-out between the Navy, the CIA and a drug cartel that takes place in the middle of an honest to God cattle stampede?\n\nAnd that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly why I like Afro Samurai so much. There are plenty of samurai stories with depth and complexity to them\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Samurai Jack, Seven Samurai, Rurouni Kenshin\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But in how many of them do we get to see the main character ride a robot version of themselves into the stratosphere, and then fight it all the way down? The only theme that Afro Samurai really tackles is the cost of revenge, as you do get to feel the bodies of Afro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friends and enemies pile up over time, which forces you to wonder whether or not vengeance for his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death is really worth it in the first place, and his past does come back to haunt him at numerous occasions, as will often happen with the hunt for vengeance. Aside from this, there are a lot of things that just kind of happen, but the saving grace\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And what makes the execution here so good\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all done with so much sincerity that none of it ever feels forced or pointless. Every single fight is memorable, no matter how easily they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re resolved, and even no matter how forgettable or how generic the attackers themselves may be.\n\nDoes this excuse the obvious problems with the series? Well, yes and no. On the one hand, while this series does make for good popcorn material, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t offer much in the way of a rewatch, and much like your typical Superman story, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of difficult to get invested in the story of an unstoppable man. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also quite a bit that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make any sense\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The rules behind the headbands in particular are a head scratcher, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not just talking about how easy it would be to fake a #2 headband, but\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 What happens when #2 kills #1? Do they choose who gets the #2? Apparently they do, because Justice just hands it over to little Afro so that some bandits can pick it up. And why can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t someone just break the rules and kill the #1 with a sniper rifle? Guns exist! And while I had no problem with most of Afro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enemies, the writers never portended that they were supposed to be important\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Except for the Empty Seven, who prove to be completely wasted by the end.\n\nAnd yet, the series keeps a consistent tone that makes it really easy to get lost in. Shallow as the story may be, one dimensional as adult Afro may be, underdeveloped as several concepts may be, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a dark, gritty story that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taken completely seriously and steeped in the love of two very adult genres. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely style over substance, but with both a style and substance that feel more like a collaboration between Kanye West and Quentin Tarrantino than a collaboration between Sam Jackson and a Mangaka, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth at least a second look. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say the series is as much as the sum of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parts, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something to be said for how much fun it is to watch a passion project that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s creatively unhinged, and held back only by budgetary limits. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not trying to be art, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trying to be grindhouse, and to that end, it does a pretty solid job.\n\nAfro Samurai is available from Funimation in an impressive fold-out DVD case, as well as your standard thin blu-ray release. A follow-up movie, Afro Samurai Resurrection, is also available from the same company, and while you can buy them separately, you can also get them as a bundle in a set called The Complete Murder Sessions. The original manga consists of only two volumes, and it IS available stateside from Seven Seas Entertainment. A video game for the Playstation 3 and X-Box 360 is unfortunately out of print, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that difficult to find a copy online.\n\nAfro Samurai isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for everyone. I personally enjoy it, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good reason I can only watch this series about once a year, tops. It has a definite cool factor, but so did the first seasons of RWBY and Hellsing, and I hated both of those. Granted, Afro Samurai has quite a bit more to offer than those two did(as much as it fails compared to their future incarnations), mostly in regard to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great production values, addictive music and engrossing adult tone, but I have to admit that if it were even one episode longer, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d probably hate it. I love Afro Samurai, but like so many other guilty pleasures out there, I have to be brutally honest about it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 This series works really well, but only in small doses spaced out over time. Hell, even as far as Samurai shows with heavy hip-hop influences go, Samurai Champloo did it first and better. I give Afro Samurai a 5/10  "}, {"id": 3413, "score": 61, "body": "Sometimes you shouldn't complicate simplicity.\n\nGundam 00 is a peculiar installment in its franchise. Being an introduction into the Gundam franchise for many a fan, myself included, it has arguably become the most popularly viewed entry besides Wing. One could say that the writers looked at Wing and decided to take some of the base elements of it to create their own story that touched on war-related issues of the current times. Then that same person could say that they probably should have followed Wing just a little more loosely given how convoluted and nonsensical circumstances regarding the main group became.\n\nA group known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cCelestial Being\u00e2\u0080\u009d has appeared in the distant future with one simple objective: fight to bring peace and end all war. Many factions across the globe disagree with their objective which seems aggressively contrary to their methods. Four young adult pilots, half of whom have been affected by war, are deployed by Celestial Being to stop disputes with force, relying on what Gundam fans have referred to as the \u00e2\u0080\u009coverkill formula\u00e2\u0080\u009d, in which single machines mow down dozens of mooks at a time. Sounds relatively simple enough as long as the show manages to highlight and keep track of the multiple factions. The idea comes with the potential to explore all sorts of concepts related to war, terrorism, protests, and global violence in ways unique to the timeline, while slowly peeling the layers of each major combatant. To an extent, 00 seems to capitalize on this potential, even showing a more personal example of what happens to civilians caught in the crossfires of battle. \n\nThen we get the robot equivalent to Dragon Ball Z\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Kai-o-ken, an extra private faction that hijacks a poorly explained supercomputer the main protagonists\u00e2\u0080\u0099 faction was using, a council that oversees all of this, even more private investors with their own agendas that get killed off unceremoniously, special particle beams that prevent healing, a myriad of poorly-conceived world-building mechanics that get dropped after what little exploration they had such as the space colonies, a badly done newtype-esque type attribute known as quantum brain-waves, and the knowledge that the series has dropped the ball in making sure we are able to keep up with every private faction. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even going into the cloning, the innovade/innovator business, Zeta Gundam plagiarism and self-contradictions galore, the increased levels of over-complication in regards to the quantum brain wave mechanic that defines the timeline from the moment one of the main characters gets affected by it as early as episode 3 of season 1, and superpowers that allow communication with the dead, all of which occur in the second season!\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry, was that overwhelming? Good; now you know what watching the 00 series is like!\n\nOne could argue that this series is best enjoyed without attempting to stretch your mental capacity to house all the convoluted nonsense and mental-gymnastics taken by the second half of season 1 onwards. Thanks to the flashy and well-animated mech battles with loads of colorful particles and explosions, and the sexy character designs that pave the way for many moments of casual semi-nudity without the need for fanservice, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d agree. The designs of each mech are nowhere near as iconic or memorable as those of most other installments, but they do serve their purpose in seeming like the aggressive war machines they are. The music, while certainly not up to Kenji Kawai\u00e2\u0080\u0099s standard, has some decently memorable tracks that do an acceptable job of complimenting the plethora of fights shown throughout. The opening themes also serve well at getting people excited for each episode, as mediocre and often meaningless as each episode may be. They also represent the state of the show in each half, with the first being more simple and about characters getting to know each other and how things are beginning to play out, and the second being more chaotic and more intense in nature, as the action and overall emotional baggage rack up. Sadly, the ending themes, which do follow this, are less enjoyable.\n\nFor anyone hoping the characters would provide much of the enjoyment you would likely obtain from the show, just know this won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t likely be the case. The main 4 are mostly simple enough. Allelujah Haptism and Setsuna F Seiei (get used to these kinds of names) had the potential to be the most interesting in the show, given that the former suffers from split-personality disorder and that the latter, who is the main protagonist, is a more reserved and agitated chap who became a child soldier who grew to display trust and touch issues after being betrayed. They only somewhat capitalize on these personal aspects, more so for Allelujah than Setsuna, as the latter is largely Heero Yui from Wing, but with more baggage. Lockon Stratos is the most easy-going and friendly of the bunch, so many will deem him the most likable, even when the chips are down and he gets angry at his comrades or at terrorists. Contrast this with the initially unlikable and ultimately boring Tieria Erde. The rest of the astronomically large cast was largely tolerable, with very few standouts in positive or negative regards. The few exceptions include the fun and determined Graham Acker, the gloriously evil Ali al Saachez --both of whom are Setsuna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main rivals--, and a painfully disappointing trio that joins the main 4 in the second half. Few are badly written per se, beyond how the script becomes a joke towards the end, but most of the potential many of these characters had is lost, with the second season doing them no favors. You might enjoy the rest of the crew the main protagonists collaborate with, notably the commander, Sumeragi, but getting attached to the wrong crew member may cost you towards the end. They are likely the best characters in the show, given that they allow for some pleasant and even humorous interactions with the main cast and even each other. \n\nGundam 00 was a potentially captivating series squandered by an unchecked need for complication and drama. As such, its characters feel wasted and its world feels poorly developed and half-baked. You will find fun with the action scenes as well as a few of the side characters and their interactions, but you would want to treat this series as simpler than it actually is, lest you watch it start to be torn apart by the power of expectations and critical thinking. 00 goes downhill from here, so if you wish to start this, just know you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting the best of what the timeline has to offer pretty early on."}, {"id": 3421, "score": 50, "body": "The world of Pokemon can be a strange, wonderful, and often terrifying place. Along with humans and a select few diminutive and unimpressive animals, this world is inhabited by a race of peculiar creatures known as, of course, Pokemon. These creatures come in all shapes and sizes, from tiny moles and worms to giant whales and rock-snakes, and while some of the smaller ones might make good pets, almost all of them are capable of devastating feats. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s understandable that some people may give Pokemon a wide berth, avoiding them at all costs, but there are a few brave souls among us who dare to encounter them up close and personal on a regular basis, bettering themselves in order to overcome any obstacle the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Pokemon might put forth. We call them Pokemon Trainers, and the very best among them, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve captured or at least owned one sample out of every known Pokemon, are considered Pokemon Masters! Of course, realistically, there can only be one Pokemon Master, as a select few Pokemon are one-of-a-kind, and capturing just one of them destroys the chances for anyone else to achieve said accolade. Seriously, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up with that?\n\nAmong these unique creatures are the legendary birds, Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres. These Titans of unimaginable elemental power live on a series of islands near Shamouti in the Orange Islands region, engaged in an ancient stalemate over their territory, unknowingly guarding the dormant beast of the sea. Should any one of those three be captured and removed from the scenario, that beast will roar to life and throw the world into chaos. This legend has attracted the attention of Lawrence III, a Pokemon collector with a hunger for the rare and valuable. Using his incredible technology, he has every intention of capturing these titans in order to lure out the beast of the sea\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Who he believes to be the legendary Lugia. Unfortunately for him, an old prophecy states that when the balance of power taming the beast becomes perturbed, a chosen one can step in and make things right again! And as it just so happens, Ash Ketchum and his friends are passing through the area on the way to their next Orange Islands gym battle, when they wind up getting dragged into the conflict. When the world turns to ash, will one of these brave souls step up and take the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fate into their own hands? Or will humanity become the next one-of-a-kind species?\n\nimg660(http://www.drunkdorks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/maxresdefault-1.jpg)\n\nRemember in my review of the first movie, how I said it struck the right balance between CG and 2D animation, and that the balance would get progressively worse with each passing movie? This is where it starts, and oh boy does it get off to a noticeable start. Right off the bat, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re shown Lawrence\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Castle in the Sky, a giant floating base somehow kept in the air by slowly turning propellers. If this movie had come out a few years later, it would probably be paired with Feel Good Inc as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pop song BGM. Anyway, this thing is the most obvious, out of place computer-generated construct since the tongue beasts in the first Resident Evil movie, and two dimensional characters appearing in the same shot look about as real and natural as paper dolls taped to a very expensive child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s toy. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also pretty obvious how much money went into this thing, because about half of this movie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s animation is about as low quality as the show, with talking heads moving and freezing on still canvases, and barely any background movement in shots that have lots of people on them.\n\nIf that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not bad enough, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a scene very early on where the team is traveling by boat, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hit by a storm that causes some turbulence. There is a shot where Pikachu is standing nervously on the rocking boat in a close-up, and I swear to Arceus they just took the still image and shook it around to give the illusion of movement. Characters often seem to freeze into the background whenever they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not talking, some of the scenes are very poorly shot(like Ash\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arrival on Shamouti), and a lot of the movie is distinctly out of frame, due to 4Kids\u00e2\u0080\u0099 decision to convert the film from widescreen to fullscreen. Another obvious CG effect is an entirely pointless scene where hoards of Pokemon are stuck on an ice sheet staring out into the water, but can still be seen moving from a mile away, including Kangaskhan doing her little sumo stomp. The only moments where the CG and 2D elements blend nicely to the tune of a decent budget, and thus the moments that differentiate it from future movies, are the action scenes, most notably when the legendary birds are fighting either Lawrence\u00e2\u0080\u0099s devices, each other, or both. The animation for these moments are breathtaking, fast paced, and over-all a joy to watch, to the point that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d actually say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth sitting through the rest of the movie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s animation to get there.\n\nThe music, however, is a step up from the first movie. The score is powerful and epic, particularly with the music that accompanies the action set pieces. Rather than a Danny Elfman sound, like the first movie utilized, this one has more of a John Williams sound, which is equally appropriate. Where the first film had a dark and ominous tone, this one plays out more like a grand, sweeping adventure, so the music has to be a lot bolder and, well, for lack of a better term, bigger. This does unfortunately result in a lot of the tunes sounding a bit homogenized, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not necessarily a bad thing, as this type of movie kind of calls for it. It only tends to get annoying when it comes to what I can only describe as the musical motif of the film, a certain wind tune that a new female character introduces us to. She never states what she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s playing, and I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t identify it by ear, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just call it an Ocarina. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to the plot, so I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t harp on it too much, but suffice to say it gets old pretty quick. Thankfully, with Lugia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Song as an example, it rarely ever plays in the background without evolving into something far more awesome.\n\nThe soundtrack in this movie is nowhere near as embarrassing as the first one, as it seems to have been put together with a much better focus than it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pop-song grabbing predecessor. The Ocarina motif that I mentioned before gets expanded into a full song by Donna Summer, which was based off of one of this movie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s three names, The Power of One. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pretty great song, not gonna lie, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very nature carries one of the most unfortunate problems with the english version of the movie, which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to later. The pop version of Pokemon World is also pretty awesome, even though it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being sung by two nineties bands that haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been mentioned by living people for over ten years. Yeah, the song itself is fun, but it only really becomes cringeworthy if you watch the two bands performing it onstage, which is totally a thing on the DVD extras. Those poor teen bastards. Even the actors from Pokemon Live came away more dignity than that. Flying Without Wings by Westlife is a pretty decent song\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 well, at least the cut the movie used\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And for a bit of unexpected weirdness, Weird Al actually pops up in the credits to combine the Pokerap with his own Polka trend.\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d call a perfect soundtrack, but at least they tried to keep things relevant this time around. But much like the first movie, there are tunes on the CD that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make it into the movie\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Dreams by Alysha Antonino has the makings of a pretty good song, but the production features the absolute worst flavor of the late nineties. The lyrics themselves are almost poignant in their message, but the orchestration is just butt ugly. The Extra Mile by Laura Pausini is really generic, and could easily be placed in the credits of almost any film without feeling out of place. I hate to get mean over a song that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been lost in time, but when I buy a CD and load the songs to Itunes, this is the kind of song I leave off. The same could be said by One Heart by O-Town, which probably the most memorable forgotten band in existence, and With All Your Heart by Plus One. The only songs present that are as entertainingly bad as the last CD are Chosen One by The B-52s, which almost seems to be making fun of the movie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prophecy, and They Just Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Understand, a song by a bunch of twelve year olds called Dream Street about their love of the franchise. This one also appears on the DVD in all it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cringey glory, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re welcome.\n\nFor the most part, there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much I can say about the english dub without talking about the series, as the acting in this movie is pretty much the same as the series at it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always felt that the acting was the best part of the 4Kids dub, with the writing always being more hit-or-miss, heavy emphasis on the miss. I will concede that Ed Paul as Tracey is slightly less annoying than Eric Stuart as Brock. That, and while it might just be my imagination, Addie Blaustein was putting forth a bit more effort than usual as Meowth. Another performance of note comes from Veronica Taylor, who we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve all gotten used to hearing as Ash, but also gets to play Ash\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother in this film, and she gets a really heartfelt exchange with him later in the movie. Eric Rath was a bit on the forgettable side in his turn as Lugia, and despite having just as little voice acting experience, Neil Stewart was quite a bit better as Lawrence. Nathan Price, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done a bit more than those two, does a great job as Slowking, making the character sound like a slow, dim-witted person who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s somehow come upon great intelligence but still speaks like he used to.\n\nThe worst thing about this dub are the changes it made to the material, of which there are far too many. There was at least one plot point that I hoped was a rewrite, but no, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The rewrites that do exist are way worse. The relationship between the Legendary Birds and the Beast of the Sea is given a much better explanation in the Japanese, although it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a work of fantasy, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not THAT much better. There was originally a moment when Tracey was allowed to shine by helping his friends to science their way out of a jam, but that got cut, so he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basically as useless as his Venonat was in the opening short. Much worse than these, and probably much more shocking to westerners who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never seen both versions, is the fact that the whole \u00e2\u0080\u009cPower of One\u00e2\u0080\u009d idea was entirely a dub-only concept. In the Japanese, not only was there no such thing as a \u00e2\u0080\u0098chosen one,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 but from what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been told, there was no prophecy, either. The film actually had a heavy emphasis on teamwork, which makes more sense considering how much help Ash needs throughout. Much like the pacifism of the first movie, this just goes to show how confused 4Kids can get when it comes to teaching western-friendly morals. If you can, stick to the sub.\n\nIf you knew me around the turn of the century, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d know that I was a huge Pokemon fanatic. If you were also a member of the Pokemon fandom, you probably also knew that I was a huge fan of the Orange Islands arc. To this day, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still my favorite season of the original series, and the only season that I own on DVD. It was just so different from anything that came before, or that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s come out of the series since. As far as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m aware, it was the only season to not be connected to the games, although I did at least attempt to run the fan-made Pokemon Orange-version on my piece of crap MacIntosh. I loved how much creative freedom it had, as it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tied down to the formula of the Kanto region, as they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to dedicate each episode to revealing a new Pokemon, and they could just write episodes revolving around new concepts of older, already established Pokemon. Some very popular iconic Pokemon got to take center stage, like Lapras and Snorlax, and the battles didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to be actual battles, and there was a lot more material for Pokeshippers. It was a breath of fresh air, and the news of an upcoming movie finally got my ass into theaters.\n\nSo how did it hold up? Well, you hardly need me to tell you how popular it is. While the critics were notoriously tough on it, giving it only a one point advantage over it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s predecessor, it is one of the most common fan favorites among the actual Pokemon fandom. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lowest review score on Myanimelist is a 6(until now), and none of those reviews lasted more than a single page(until now). It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not hard to see why, because this was the first Pokemon movie to feel like an actual movie. It had a more epic, theatrical feel to it, with higher stakes and arguably a more ambitious story than most other Pokemon films. It introduced two Generation 2 Pokemon, not counting Elekid in the opening short, and the ones it did introduce in the main story were actually important to the plot, not cannon fodder in a random opening battle. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not often considered the best movie in the Pokemon line-up, that honor often goes to the Entei and Lucario movies, but it is a generally respected and highly regarded movie\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Which is why it might surprise you to hear me say that it really isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t THAT much better than the first film.\n\nNow, credit where credit is due, it does a much better job following the traditional three act structure. In the first act, we meet the villain. We learn about who he is, what his plan is, and what will happen if said plan comes to fruition. We also get introduced to the main character, why he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the area, and how he gets drawn into the conflict. We get all the backstory we need, and then some, as well as intros of basically every single plot point that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to matter. In the second act, the plot picks up, and we see the main character set out to resolve the conflict as quickly as possible, even though the conflict is way bigger and more dangerous than he initially thought, and his inability to solve the problem leads him into a worsening situation, where things basically hit rock bottom. Finally, in the third act, the worst case scenario happens, the main makes a much grander stand, and it all builds to a climax that delivers on everything that set it up. Power of One follows the three act structure so well that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost like the writers made a conscious effort to do so, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ultimately the reason that the movie feels so much more like, well, a movie.\n\nHaving said that, a three act structure doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t guarantee the movie will be good, and for all of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grandeur and epic nature, this movie has just as much stupid, lore and continuity breaking material in it as the last one. First of all, harping on the English dub, the prophecy is completely pointless. Not only does it feel mind-numbingly stupid that some ancient prophecy knows who Ash is and decides that only he, one of the most incompetent heroes in anime history, can possibly set the world back to right, but there was nothing in the prophecy about Lawrence starting all of this conflict. It also doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work in terms of the story, because Ash doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need a prophecy to tell him to go into action and save the world\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good person, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do it anyway! Hell, I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even make that point if it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for the fact that (mild spoilers in this sentence) Team Rocket, the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s signature antagonists, decide all on their own to turn over a new leaf and act heroic for the sake of saving the planet. Ash needed a prophecy to call him out by name(In an oh so clever pun that fooled absolutely nobody), but Team Rocket are the altruists in the scenario? Bull to the motherfucking shit!\n\nGoing right back to act one, not only does Lawrence have a Pokemon trading card\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Which just throws all kinds of logic out the window, because this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Digimon Tamers we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But the exposition he gets from his computer makes no sense. It identifies the prophecized Titans as the legendary birds, which means he likely didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know that yet, and since the prophecy mentioned nothing about Shamouti, how the hell is he already in the area? And why are Ash and friends taking a ferry, when they usually just ride on Lapras\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back? It would make sense in a Pokemon game, but they never had random encounters on her back before. Also, how did Lawrence and Ash move into position on the exact annual day that the island was expecting this exact catastrophe to occur? Then in the second act, we get such gems as Tracey being useless, a flying sailboat, Ash trying to tackle an electrified cage, and to top it all off, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a strong implication that in order to catch all existing Pokemon\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Or to \u00e2\u0080\u009cCatch\u00e2\u0080\u0099em All,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which is explicitly the catch phrase of the series, you would have to destroy the world as we know it in the process. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think they really thought this through.\n\nThen the third act happens, and I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m saying this, but it damn near justifies everything. In the first movie, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cthird act,\u00e2\u0080\u009d if you could call it that, is where it failed hardest, as it used it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s climax to crawl right up inside it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own ass. This, however, is what a third act is supposed to be. Every single plot point, even the worst ones like Misty bantering with Melody over her crush on Ash, comes to a satisfying conclusion. Even though there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well-animated action scenes throughout the movie, this part of the story upstages all of them, as it should, with Lawrence being largely written out of the story so the birds themselves can fight among themselves, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as awesome as it sounds. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say nothing stupid happens\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Bulbasaur and Squirtle are shown to run as fast as Charizard flies, in a scenario when he really should have tried to call out Lapras, and the dialogue between Melody and Misty ends in an exchange that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make much sense\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m assuming only one person in that group has any idea how to play the Ocarina\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter, because every moment leads to something great. Does that make all the stupid crap that we had to sit through to get to that point okay? No, not really, but at least there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something at the end worth sitting through it all for. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not much, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something.\n\nimg660(https://pa1.narvii.com/5678/b2a0f3cdbc82ae3bba416946dbeb5eb7b671ada3_hq.gif)\n\nPokemon the movie 2000, also known as The Power of One and Revelation Lugia, is available from Viz Media in both single format and a three-pack with the first and third films. . You can also find the out of print original DVD from Warner Home Video, albeit at a much more expensive price. Unlike the first movie, you can also find the soundtrack and score on the same CD, although brand new copies are quite a bit more expensive. Netflix generally has about four or five different Pokemon movies available for legal streaming at any given time, and this is occasionally one of them.\n\nDespite my criticisms, this is my favorite Pokemon movie, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the one I have the most nostalgic feelings for. There are at least two scenes in it that make me cry\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 One involving Team Rocket, the other involving Ash\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mom\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something no other Pokemon movie can say. It also expands upon the lore in a lot of interesting ways, such as giving a few characters first names for the first time. Of course, just because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my personal favorite doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make it one of the best ones. I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even call it one of the top five. Looked at as a sequel, it just barely surpasses the first movie in terms of scale and execution, but the story is still based on coincidence, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a lot of dumb and inaccurate material, and it breaks the fourth wall more than any Pokemon movie should. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fall into the trap of pushing a confused and hypocritical moral, but it only pulls this off by not trying to push ANY moral\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Which is probably the smart way to go, but it still doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t convey the kind of growth that a sequel should go through. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sense of pacing, structure and emotional resonance, as well as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s killer third act ultimately saves it, but doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t vindicate it. I give Pokemon the Movie 2000 a 5/10.  "}, {"id": 3422, "score": 50, "body": "One year after the movie with the same title, Sion Sono's Suicide Club was finally adapted to the manga written by Usamaru Furuya with the same title. It's not his first work I've read from the author. Previously, I had read Ningen Shikkaku adapted from a novel by Osamu Dazai's No Longer Human which was used as a reference in a show called Aoi Bungaku Series, involved five directors including Tetsurou Araki who directed Death Note and Morio Asaka who directed Cardcaptor Sakura. It's not one of the darkest or depressing even though because this is a short manga, it has the same story and premise as the movie about mass suicide by schoolgirls.\n\nWhile this is just a one-volume manga with six chapters, there isn't much I can say from it. As begin with one of the most memorable, horrible, and disturbing opening sequences ever, it tells the story of Saya Kota who surviving mass suicide on a train where 50 more of schoolgirls died without being left. Saya Kota who survived the suicide slowly lost her both mentally and externally. In this case, Kyoko who is her best friend felt something empty inside her and tried to find out the ins and outs of the club, the terrifying history from the club, and why it could happen. I love this kind of story because, in the end, the story will continue in an endless-cycle without anything that stops, there will be other victims who fall continuously. Indeed, the story feels forced, there is no depth of the story, and it makes no any sense like I just don't know why the people or adults in the manga didn't take an action which one of the characters existed. In fact, there are so many plot holes which I don't think are logic in the story apart from this is disturbing and creepy manga. Yet, six chapters at least making you as the worst nightmare for once.\n\nThe important point that leads to the horror aspect of this manga is that the art which is certainly so creepy. The character designs are almost all frightful, whatever anyone, the girls, the adults, the other characters, anything. They always make some various facial expressions which it makes me weird but not too creepy. This part also builds the mood of the characters because the design character looks like a bad person from the outside. Still, it got me some weird feeling from the gore aspect especially at the end of the story.\n\nAlthough Kyoko is the hero of this manga, Saya Kota is actually the main focused. We learn about her past, comparing her characteristics before joining the suicide club until it seems to be one of the brainwashed. The manga also explains the various dark events and history of the club itself, the former leaders before Saya Kota, and others. Sensei which helped through the story where I thought he was the person behind it or the bad guy, it's not like that. This point, as well as what I said, seems forced and told in one story so that it's forgettable. I don't know the obvious reason all characters in this manga of why they formed the club. The trick is if the story actually quite developing, deepening or maybe the story which is exiled by society, it might add to the impression but there is nothing like that.\n\nThis kind of story is indeed interesting at certain points and I also can't say how I feel. I don't find it memorable because this is one of the most manga that can be read in just a few minutes. This manga mixes a feeling that I can't understand but at the very least, it's a bit enjoying with stories which are so depressing, creepy, but weird regardless of the plot holes.\n\nJisatsu Circle is not one of the bad ones with a concept that involves a society and dark yet terrifying impression. Ningen Shikkaku is one of the hard manga to read not because there are some lacks but it's really hit at the certain point. This manga is also not recommended for people who don't like gore, especially the body pieces. Various aspects are at least developed through a little because it might be more interesting to add some unique things from the characters or references from the movie which I haven't watch the movie yet. Jisatsu Circle is not too memorable yet not too interesting but it's one that I love about the horror which involves psychological and mental illness."}, {"id": 3446, "score": 64, "body": "Nadia is a strange and interesting series to talk about. From its reception, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d find a show that can go from fun to nauseating and amazing to terrible at the drop of a hat after a magnificent early run. From the title and the premise, this show sounds like a wonderfully charming time. It creates this sense of trepidation as to whether you should watch the show, as while there is a lot of joy to be had, some may deem the lengthy yet temporary drop in quality not worth sitting through even for the \u00e2\u0085\u0094 of the show that is worth cherishing.\n\nAllow me to state that for all intents and purposes, now only is this show worth watching, but that a majority of it is some of the most charming and pleasant anime out there. Beyond the main antagonists and Nadia herself, every major character has a distinct level of whimsy and chemistry that make you want nothing more than to join them on their exploits. Absolute standouts include Grandis, Hanson, and Sanson, who apart from wonderful child character Marie, have the loudest and most animated personalities of the entire cast. Even the Nautilus crew manages to be wonderful despite the majority of them being tertiary characters. Along with the pluckiness of Jean, it becomes a glorious treat seeing their frantic exploits, and a blow to the heart to see them in tragedy. \n\nThis is another of Nadia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defining strengths, and indeed something that Gainax is known for: its ability to elegantly tiptoe between charming fun and soul-crushing despair. The directing tends to compliment the scenes of sorrow magnificently, courtesy of the legendary Hideaki Anno and even the not-so-legendary Shinji Higuchi when the time calls for it every now and then in Anno\u00e2\u0080\u0099s absence later on. The visuals on display are generally wonderful, with fantastic character designs from Grandis, to Gargoyle, to the iconic design of Nadia and all her wonderful clothes. Each design adds a distinct personality to these characters no matter what they wear, which is yet another of this studio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most notable strengths. The animation is so vibrant, kinetic, and fluid that chase sequences and all other major action sequences are a sight for sore eyes. \n\nAll of this is accompanied perfectly by the wonderful score composed by legendary Evangelion and Bleach composer Shiro Sagisu. Apart from the wonderful opening and ending themes, Sagisu composed a fantastic repertoire for this show. It goes from the heartwarming Ashita e, Hope, and Love of Tomorrow, to the gloriously imposing tracks of Neo Atlantis and Gargoyle, the melancholic tunes of Tragedy and Requiem, and the bombastic fun of The Evil Trio and All Purpose Submarine. While not all of these songs are extremely memorable, and even some of the ones listed here aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as fantastic as others, the OST is still a real treat forged by a master of his craft.\n\nIt all blends to create a work that feels as natural and whimsical as anime can be. All of this truly sounds like a wonderful time that no one should pass up, and it is...until the dreaded island arc assaults you like Gargoyle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ships do to the Nautilus. For whatever production-issue related reason this arc had to go the way it did, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no getting around it: this arc sucks! A whopping 12 episodes that have humor that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fit with the show, several moments where characters are derailed or contradictory for either cheap gags and convenience like Marie in episode 25, King in episode 26, and Nadia in several portions of this arc. Other time, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done because the director and screenwriter of this portion of the show seemingly have no idea what to do with them like with Hanson and Sanson. The visuals take a hit as well, with episodes that have the character models seeming off at all times, several moments where there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a looping image for at least half a minute, and several clip shows. To be fair, the earlier half had some problems with looping footage as well, and two problems that permeate the entire show are hoe the blatant and sometimes incomplete the looping footage is, and how the visuals sometimes get jittery. The island arc sadly does this issue even worse, and had far fewer scenes if interesting direction than what came before or after said portion of the show. It has a hard time finding that delicate tone balance that Gainax is known for as well, and it goes on for far longer than it has any right to. Lastly, while Nadia was certainly a tough character to put up with, her flippant hot and cold personality and more abrasive attitudes towards her peers about anything -especially the killing and consumption of animals- at least made consistent sense. While this arc does flesh out how she got this mindset, it also has her contradict herself constantly for no good reason other than a sheer mishandling of a tricky character that happens to be the focal point of this entire show. It's a truly loathesome experience fromm beginning to end. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more I want to say about this arc but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll save that it another time.\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like the show picks up that much past this point. The final episodes are an absolute mess with glaring holes and moments of characters missing easy opportunities and making obviously wrong decisions, sloppy writing that feels like it assumes that the island arc answered important questions and connected pieces of its narrative to this final stretch better than it actually did. Even the power of willpower is used here, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as cheesy as you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d expect. Character inconsistency also finds itself present within this stretch as well, and as intimidating as the villains are, even this portion of the show fails to make them anything but one-note pretentious \u00e2\u0080\u009chumans are our troubled servants so we must rule over them with an iron fist\u00e2\u0080\u009d characters and puppets. Characters such as Jean find themselves absolutely useless as well, and the final moments of this show are astronomically ridiculous for a variety of damning spoiler-related reasons that range from narratively nonsensical to character-shattering. \n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s honestly sad what happened here. Several of the early episodes were wonderful in nearly every way, and even the final episodes managed to instill a sense of scale and raw fun. The vibrant and epically fluid animation led to some brilliant sequences that make this show feel like it would be an absolute classic. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just that the show truly started fumbling in terms of its narrative halfway through and then dropped nearly every ball for roughly a third of its run before just becoming a fun yet total mess towards the end. With a bit of retooling and tons of cutting, the dreaded island arc could still be as wonderful as what came before it, and with that same level of retooling, the final episodes could have avoided being as messy as they ended up being while giving more characters a purpose. Regardless, despite how tumultuous the voyage ended up being, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still one I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d thoroughly recommend, if only with a few caveats.\n\nIsland Arc Rewrite: https://thecrimsoncolosseum.wordpress.com/2018/09/06/rewriting-nadias-island-arc/"}, {"id": 3448, "score": 55, "body": "There is an effect in the arts, most notably in music, dubbed the \"sophomore slump\". It relates to the fact that the sequel to an acclaimed or beloved work often pales in comparison to its predecessor. If a movie is a smash hit, the sequel will be less of a hit. A band's first album is a milestone in its genre? Next album is half of one. Of course, there are exceptions to this rule and the term is fairly overstated. Yet the term has become so commonplace that it's much easier to think of the \"slumps\" than it is of the \"rises\". In the case of the Stars series, I found out that Crest of the Stars was much more of a beloved show than I had thought (outside of knowing the novels won a Seiun award back in the 90's). However, its sequel Banner doesn't seem to get the same amount of love. In Banner's defense, I don't think it's a case of \"sophomore slump\" as much as it is the expectations of the viewers coming into it. \n\nThe most notable thing that Banner does, for me, is that it \"stops pretending\". I mentioned in my Crest review about how one-sided the politics feel and how it tends to be biased towards the Abh. Banner drops this element - now its Abh focused for the duration of the show. It focuses more on the battles and how the characters (most notably Lafiel's division) feel about their placement in the war. Though dropping the politics may put some in a dour mood, I actually see this as an improvement for the show. If the show wanted to be like LoGH and show balance between the two sides, it did a poor job at it - its hard to see the conflict past \"Abh good, humans bad\" with such a warped perspective. It now has more time for action and the characters, which is something I liked about the show in the first place. Dropping the weaker elements and strengthening the more prevalent elements allows me to see the show for what it is instead of what its trying to compete with.\n\nSo what's happened in the 3 years since the last adventure? Lafiel's become a captain of the ship Basroil while Jinto has become a trusty supply officer (who, obviously, is enrolled by Lafiel for her crew). Some new characters are introduced as Lafiel's crew members, like the taciturn and serious Ekuryua, the drinking blue-collar spirit of Samson and the mature Wing Flyer Sobaash. Other characters are introduced as commanders of other ship divisions. Lafiel's commander, Atosuryua, is the sister of the Baron they killed 3 years prior. The Bibos twins, Nefei and Nereis, are known for their \"Beautiful Insanity\" when it comes to drawing up battle plans. Finally, a few characters return from Crest - the haughty commander Spoorh and the supreme commander Dusanyu. Rather than an adventure, the episodes focus on the buildup and battle defending the critical area of the Aptic Gate. We see how the Abh react, prepare and fight against a human fleet of 15 times their own size. Fans of more tactical thought will enjoy this season more as there are a lot more dangerous situations. Outnumbered battles and new enemy weapons keep the Abh on their toes and the battles often turn from one of equal footing to one of strategic survival.\n\nThat said, the best part of Banner of the Stars is not these battles but the characters. Banner of the Stars' theme is discussing a person's place and role in the universe and these introspective moments is when we see the characters as more than cartoons. Jinto channels his inner Shinji Ikari (Evangelion) and contemplates his loneliness in the empire (non-Abh race, lost his family completely) and if anyone would truly miss him if he were gone. Lafiel battles her strong will against the commands of others and learns of the important roles that a leader has vs. her usual solo nature. Outside these two, Samson is the best character in the show. He comes from the surface like Jinto, but is older and has experienced years of the Abh's space service. His remark that people much younger than him are passing him by while he retains the same position is a bittersweet message of the show.  We don't get to see too much of his serious side, as he prefers drinking and joking, but the few moments of solemnness we get with him are some of the best in the show. Perhaps that's why I find it to be so special - it's rare but it's there and it makes an impact.\n\nAlthough the show's change of direction is something I approve, it still ultimately has problems. I didn't mention it in the Crest review but both Crest and Banner suffer greatly from one thing - its dryness. A show about space battles with grandiose scores should be exciting, but I don't feel it too often due to the Abh race. The Abriels, Ekuryua, and even the Bibos twins deliver lines in a very flat way with no dynamics in range. They're not free of emotions, but it often feels like they're trying their best to not show any - they don't come off as charismatic nor remotely interesting. You'd think that the Bibos twins, with the name \"Beautiful Insanity\", would do something mind blowing but the only real insanity is the constant one-upping the brothers try to do with each other. Even they admit they play it quite safe for battle plans this time around. Some characters, such as Sporh, break free from this but in the wrong way, coming off as bratty and more in place for a rom-com than a space opera. Not all characters suffer from this (Samson, Atosuruya), but they're a minority in the cast of undesirable characteristics. I'm not asking for people goofing off or being comic relief - this is a war and lives are on the line, after all. Just a little more expression would go a long way with me. The anime, as said above, is based on a novel series. For books, you don't get to see the action - you have to imagine it. So if I can imagine the characters saying their lines much more expressively than I can see them in the adaptation, I'd rather read the book.\n\nOther issues I find stem not from what the show does but what it doesn't do. An example is the earlier mentioned Bibos twins, who aren't particularly insane in their battle performance. The way I see it, Sporh is far more \"insane\" in her approach (\"crush the weak\" philosophy) than the Bibos twins. Another good example is Roi Atosuruya, Lafiel's commander. You would think that Atosuruya, being the brother of the Baron that Jinto and Lafiel killed, would have contempt towards them and use her position of power subtly to endanger their lives further (as well as be an early example of cracks in the Abh empire's perfect image). However, it is treated as water under the bridge. That's a surprisingly mature approach and Atosuruya has good reasons for why there's no real issue, but it passes on an opportunity for conflict/excitement. And when a series is a dry, slow-paced watch, that can go a long way to making it a worthwhile viewing. Ultimately, many of these issues can be brushed away by stating this is a beginning or prologue to events to come. This is based on the first book in a series of five, so changes can happen and what I've said could end up being irrelevant. That said, this review covers what is shown and known for the anime, so it's a bit unfair to say \"the sequel fixes this\" when this cour must be watched first.\n\nThis show, to me, is the equivalent of reading a textbook. Yes, it's factual and there are a lot of important details you need for your classes or major. However, it's not an exciting read and it's hard to maintain excitement or interest. Like I said before, this may not apply to everyone. Those that want a more technical and tactical show will enjoy this, maybe even more so than Crest of the Stars. This isn't a bad show by any stretch, but it's just not to my preference.\n\nAs I said before, this show is more action based and it shows in a slightly higher budget. There are more fight scenes and therefore more times to show off said action. There are a lot of camera tricks involved to simulate flight (Crest also did this, in fairness) and there's some ugly early CG used occasionally, but there's more fluidity and a bit higher production qualities. Those looking for what's new in the sound department will be disappointed - most of the tracks here were all previously used in Crest. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though - Crest of the Stars had a good orchestral soundtrack. The exception is the new ED \"Pink\" by YUAMU, which evokes a 90's alternative rock song. It's a good song, and shows great contrast with the slight roughness of the lead vocals and some nice chorus harmonies. It's better than Crest's ED, though I still like the chorus for Crest's ED a bit more (it's too infectious).\n\nOverall, I give this show a 5.5. From a numerical standpoint, it may seem that I think this show is equal to Crest but that's not the case. I prefer Banner over Crest, but I find both to be similar in strengths and disappointments that they fall around the same level. If you like Crest of the Stars for its romanticized adventures, tread cautiously for Banner. You'll get more Jinto and Lafiel, but the romance and adventure aspects are both downplayed. Those looking for a more grounded show (as strange as that is to say for a space opera) will enjoy this, while those looking for something a bit more flashy should give a pass to this one. I'll admit, Banner of the Stars is for a niche audience and I am not part of that niche. Those that are will find this show to be a definitive favorite.\n\nDo you like or dislike this anime?

The term comes from the dark horses in horse racing. They aren't the popular ones that most people will bet on, but they automatically catch at least a few eyes willing to give them a chance, and low and behold, they do surprisingly well in the race, sometimes even winning. Given how bleak this season has been for most people, this seemed like one of those surprising shows that could've been one of the best of the season, but, as the saying goes, \"close but no cigar\". Fitting, really.\n\n*Paragraph 4 contains mild spoilers for ACCA: 13-ku Kansatsu-ka. Proceed with caution*\n\nACCA is an interesting show. Produced by Studio Madhouse, this is an adaptation from a manga. Ultimately, this show intrigued a lot of people, myself included. Some people will definitely see his as the dark horse of the season, but I don't entirely agree. There are strong cases to be made why this show was interesting and why it was boring, but we'll get to that. But why the polarization? Isn't this series slick as hell? Well...\n\nTo a decent extent, the story is meticulously written in terms of creating a mystery full of twists and turns. It all surrounds Jean Otus, a man working for ACCA that is currently doing audits while the prince of the nation is not only coming of age but is ready to succeed the throne. Problem number 1 is that the story really dead its feet with nothing to truly hook us for more aside from hoping that it will all explode into a chaotic and flavorful conclusion towards the final act; it doesn't. It's understandable why this turns people off, as the show feels uneventful. Two, some of these twists were both obvious and poor. The final antagonist was one of the royals whom we had never even heard of until 2/3 into the series, with two of the ACCA 5 Chief Officers being antagonists with their own separate plot. If you're anything like me, you suspected the two that turned out to be antagonists, and there was only 1 other person to remotely suspect, who isn't involved, but there could've been more flavor to the mystery by giving reason to suspect more people. \n\nSo, because Jean was suspected of being involved in an upcoming coup, his friend, Nino, is sent to spy on him, but then it's revealed that he is next in like to be king, which is why the rumor was created, in order to get the 13 districts on his side during his audits. Sounds fine and dandy, and for most part, it is, including the somewhat rushed backstory of Nino, Jean, and his sister, Lotta. It's thanks to that that the aunt of the family wants them dead, as well as the dickheaded prince himself. As for the finale, it was ok. It was interesting to see the whole coup resolve peacefully but with more twists, but there was no reason for the aunt to suddenly abandon her plan.\n\nTell me, who do you remember besides Jean and Nino? Probably nobody because these characters are mostly dull and one-note. Jean is pretty listless, by it is nice seeing him get flustered over his crush/superior Mauve, though that fades quickly. He also smokes...a lot. Just like on older times, in this anime, smoking is a sign of wealth and he gets misconstrued because of it, particularly when confronted by Rail, who acts like an ass around him and likes his sister. Nino is a slick guy, even in spy mode, but he's merely ok. Mauve, Lotta, and Gossular are merely ok, and most of the characters are boring, like prince Schwan, the aunt, the spoiler manipulator in the 5 Chief Officers, and each of Jean's subordinates and audit companions. We could've easily spent a bit more time about the characters but instead, we chose to do more audits and see the main 3 eat apple pie and drink alcohol. Like the plot, the interesting potential really fizzes out, which is a shame.\n\nTo this day, I'm not sure how to feel about the art-style. However, what is something I'm sure of is that the series is clearly not in 24FPS. The animation is rather choppy, making it feel like the series runs at only 16 frames per second instead of the minimum required 24 for everything to feel like they're in constant motion. I'm not sure if this is an artistic choice, but I don't think it works. I at least like the hair and food detail, as well as the detail in the casino lights in episode 8. The OP has amazing artistic flair to the way it looks, and the ED has another type of interesting art that is actually more fluid than the entirety of the actual series, which is kinda sad the more you think about it. After all, you'd probably expect better from Studio Madhouse since Studio DEEN did more fluid and striking animation with their also more methodical and realistic series, Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu. Thankfully the mediocre CGI is insanely minimal to the point where most people would find it nonexistent, even if some of the character faces are actually incomplete in the final episodes and the background characters often fit move in scenes.\n\nThe OST is pretty nice and fitting, especially the jingle at the beginning and middle of episode 1. It fits the calmer, more lax and methodical nature of the series perfectly, preventing me from really getting bored, but that didn't stop some people from boredom. The OP, \"Shadow and Truth\" by ONE III NOTES is pretty cool, with surprisingly good J-rap and a great female singer (even during autotune sections). There's a reason people say this is one of the best OPs of the season, it's pretty freakin' slick. As for the ED, \"Pale Moon ga Yureteru (\u00e3\u0083\u009a\u00e3\u0083\u00bc\u00e3\u0083\u00ab\u00e3\u0083\u00a0\u00e3\u0083\u00bc\u00e3\u0083\u00b3\u00e3\u0081\u008c\u00e3\u0082\u0086\u00e3\u0082\u008c\u00e3\u0081\u00a6\u00e3\u0082\u008b)\" by Aira Yuuki, is a pretty alright theme meant for some bit of emotion after each episode. Not great but not bad.\n\nAs for the dub, it's rather good. J Michael Tatum was in charge of ADR direction and we get some rather fitting boxes for many of the characters, especially Jean and Nino. It's weird to hear someone sound like Steve Blum without being Steve Blum, but that's been an issue in the dubbing industry for a good year now (where new actors sound like old ones, and this was exposed to be a major problem in the acting industry in Japan). It feels like the character art-style lends itself to both the dub and the sub rather well, and the dub worked just as well as the sub, at least for me.\n\nFor the most part, I was pretty intrigued by the narrative, even if it did get a bit dull towards the end. The atmosphere was pretty enjoyable, and the OP was so damn good that I just wanna bob my head and snap to the beat every time. It was surprisingly enjoyable if a bit lacking in the satisfaction department. T'was a nice enough time, but there wasn't enough pizzazz to give real flavor to the experience, making it somewhat underwhelming. It's by no means a bad show, but there's no way in hell this'll be smoking the competition for any \"best of winter 2017\" lists, I'm sure. It didn't rise up high, but it was decent and slick while it lasted, so that's alright, I guess.

The closest I've gotten to is dabbling in some online Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon battles and some \"For Glory\" on Smash Bros. 3DS. So, this was certainly an interesting series to look forward to, as while we've definitely had some game-oriented anime in the past that ended up being popular (namely SAO and No Game No Life), we never had one that showed the competitive side of gaming, since other game anime merely used gaming to basically flesh out a fictional game by putting players in it or have them celebrate them. This anime, made in China, shows a true badass in the realm of E-Sports. Given that China is more passionate about E-Sports than any country in the world (if World of Warcraft is any indication), it's no surprise that they would make the plunge into this before the japs would. I'm sure that plenty of E-sports players find this show to be great since it seems to really understand the terminology and what makes a good MMO game that is capable of E-sports.

Well, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s find out, shall we?\n\nYe Xiu (formerly known in-game as Ye Qiu) has just been forced into retirement of the team and of the game \u00e2\u0080\u009cGlory\u00e2\u0080\u009d by his old team \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne Autumn Leaf\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and interestingly and refreshingly enough, we see a protagonist (him) keep a level head in all this as opposed to the traditional angry retorts we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d normally hear from a situation like this. This 25 year-old man is a bit rusty, but given that he is still basically a gaming god, it's frustrating to see his team just discard him and lock him into taking only one approach for his contract. Afterwards, he simply goes \u00e2\u0080\u009coh well\u00e2\u0080\u009d and begins like working at a caf\u00c3\u00a9. Even though he starts a new account (Lord Grim) and decimates everyone, we still see a really human touch that is somewhat prevalent in this series. After all, like any real-life sport, people take it very seriously, and people do have to retire earlier than with most jobs. We see moments of true, civil familiarity that doesn't remotely touch the realm of melodrama like most anime do, like when he and his old friend Mucheng meet up again in episode 5 long after he was kicked and she had to watch, or when he and one of his old rivals square off in the finale, only for us to see their battle history in the middle of this to really sell us on their relationship. It's refreshing to see all of this. To add onto how refreshing this show is, I should make note that every single character here is a full-fledged adult, which is insanely rare nowadays.\n\nI don't have any major problems with the story to speak of in terms of any plot holes or inconsistencies or major leaps in logic, and in fact, any and all worries I began having were actually addressed. When I began wondering \u00e2\u0080\u009chow come no one realizes that Lord Grim is Ye Qiu\u00e2\u0080\u009d, we see veterans hypothesize and come to that exact conclusion. After I thought \u00e2\u0080\u009cman, you'd think more people would be apprehensive to his assholish behavior and start turning him down\u00e2\u0080\u009d, we see him fail to score a bargain in episode 9 for demanding too high a price. I really like when a story can assuage our worries of it. I'm not gonna spoil anything much, but the story does pick up after the first 4 episodes and we really get to see all sides grow tensions and even some members in many teams grow as people,and the finale, while not really giving a sense of finality, even for a season finale that will segue into a sequel, it still builds character and shows up a pretty well done human side to this whole thing. The story isn't grand or anything, but it is really solid, do I have to give it that much credit, especially since it actually assuages certain fears we have. Plus, it's very in touch with E-sports culture given how they  properly use terms like \u00e2\u0080\u009caggro\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPK\u00e2\u0080\u009d, etc.\n\nApparently, there are a number of people sort of upset about character development, or lack thereof, namely for our protagonist. Let me tell you why, in this particular instance, this isn't that much of a bad thing. The main character, Ye Xiu has already grown into an expert, and it's not only about seeing him deal with new situations in his already grown state as opposed to most characters growing while dealing with their problems, but it's about seeing how he makes others develop, not only as people, but often as rivals that team up to try to surpass him. It's not like Mahouka in which the show is about GodSuya trouncing everyone and no almost no one developing as a result of trying to reach his level since everything is all about him and how \u00e2\u0080\u009cbadass\u00e2\u0080\u009d he is. We see Ye handle things in a way that actually forces others to grow. Also, he is a total dick, often making witty trash talk comments at anyone and everyone, or exploiting people for his own personal revenge in episodes 1 and 4. He is still a good person at heart, like how he encourages Yi Fan to grow by changing styles. That's what this show is all about: seeing a cocky bit usually well-meaning badass adapt and force others to grow, which more shows that have OP protagonists should focus on instead of the usual \u00e2\u0080\u009clook at our main character, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so cool that he dominated everything effortlessly and everything revolves around him\u00e2\u0080\u009d like that other show I brought up.\n\nAdmittedly, most of the characters here aren't inherently very memorable, even if I like how they bounce off each other. That does become a problem given how many characters there are to keep track of, so I'll say that they are all pretty decently characterized despite not having much to them, and leave it at that for everyone but the major protagonists that Ye recruits for the second half of the show (and onwards). Mucheng is a beautiful badass who seems almost romantically interested in Ye, and is almost as playful as him in some regards, even if her role is more minimal than the rest of the team. Guo is the manager who has the most banter with Ye and is probably my least favorite, since honestly, after the initial episodes, she hardly provides anything to the story, bit even being part of the major team. Rou ultimately had to nod to learn since while she was powerful with hand speed, she was beyond unskilled for her talk, but ultimately, she became one of the more prominent characters to the team, even if she doesn't have that much to her personality, even less so than most of the characters. Rao Xing (Steam bun) is definitely a more nooblike, almost idiotic character who has muscle, but he actually provides some amounts of cleverness that save him from truly falling to that dreaded archetype. Ultimately, Ye carries the show in terms of the characters since we don't really see much nuance to them, but we do get to see some of them grow, whether it be these guys or some of Ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rivals, even if I'm not showing the full extent of that (for brevity and spoiler reasons).\n\nTo be honest, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m aware that this one of G.CMay Animation and Film\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first anime projects, but there are some things I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to see them improve on. The character designs are pretty good, and the flashy animation is well, flashy, but the choreography isn't anything really great. Their use of CGI is...interesting. On the one hand, when doing establishing shots and first-person perspectives on certain things in their real world, it can look pretty good, sort of like a trailer at EA for a PS4 game (especially in the first few episodes), but when they get to using character models or other objects in either stock-footage or CGI, it all looks terrible, and honestly, a lot of the techniques here, especially the ones that don't work out well, remind me of Hand Shakers, which is frightening. It doesn't do any of that anywhere near as badly as that show did, so that's a plus. However, there is an unnerving amount of reused animation, particularly when Ye switches his weapon to gun mode or when he is battling goblins (namely him throwing them and them colliding and falling in CGI \u00e2\u0080\u009cglory\u00e2\u0080\u009d). Certain CGI models either look pretty bad or look like bad claymation models that were simply painted on to the point where they look melted. Overall, the series isn't badly animated, at least for a newer studio, but I hope they can tweak the CGI and improve on the choreography.\n\nThe OP, \u00e2\u0080\u009cXin Yang (\u00e4\u00bf\u00a1\u00e4\u00bb\u00b0)\" by Zhang Jie (\u00e5\u00bc\u00a0\u00e6\u009d\u00b0), is just an eh OP to me. Maybe it's partially due to me never hearing Chinese music before, but it's just rather meh to me. Same applies to the ED, \"Rong Yao Zai Lin (\u00e8\u008d\u00a3\u00e8\u0080\u0080\u00e5\u0086\u008d\u00e4\u00b8\u00b4)\" by Da Dan Yin Zu (\u00e5\u00a4\u00a7\u00e8\u0083\u0086\u00e9\u009f\u00b3\u00e7\u00bb\u0084). In fact, the OST, while it does fit everything, it's rather meh and unmemorable, though the alternate rendition of the OP in the later moments of the final episode was pretty nice. Not a bad OST, and both the OP and ED were simply ok, but overall, it's just meh.\n\nUltimately, this first outing of The King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Avatar has more substance than some people might give it credit for, but despite the relatively entertaining humor and action, the characters and production values don't hold up all that well, even with the surprisingly solid story. Again, I imagine that E-sports players (or MMO players in general) on the whole, probably find this show more enjoyable than I do, but that doesn't mean it's not a pretty decent show, because it is. I just hope that when the next outing of this show arrives, some of these issues are ironed out and that we get to have more reasons to invest in the characters. Either way, I'm really looking forward to what the rest of the series has in store if they choose to keep animating it. With all that said, I bid you adieu."}, {"id": 3464, "score": 60, "body": "So....\n\nyeeaaaaaah.\n\nYou might be wondering why I'm reviewing this anime. You might say that reviewing something like this might be completely pointless and that watching an anime such as this with the intention of reviewing it might suck the fun out of it.\n\nYou, dear reader, would be correct.\n\nI will say that I was curious about this show ever since it was announced. But I should still stress that going in with even a bit of an analytical mind will probably ruin this show. Now let's get to reviewing it.\n\nThis is a sentence title, literally translated to \"I Want You To Make a Disgusted Face and Show Me Your Underwear.\" And there isn't a point to get into the background. That's the premise and it doesn't go any deeper than that. The anime has a second-person perspective (points for uniqueness, at least) where various women, as the title clearly spells out, are eventually talked into showing their undergarments while berating you, their faces twisted into grimaces.\n\nIt's pretty hot.\n\n...and that's about it. It's ecchi, so nothing explicit is ever shown. Panties are the height of the show and if you're lucky, you might see a garter belt and/or stockings. I don't really like how in all the vignettes, the viewer is in a position of power (either permanent of temporary) and uses it to make someone who was kind towards us show us their panties. But hey, it's not my fetish and the show didn't convert me. That's fine. I'm sure this show is absolutely amazing to the people that get their rocks off to this sort of thing.\n\nFor the rest of us, there's not much that this show has to offer. The episodes are each around four minutes long, so we have enough time to know who the women is, make our request, then see her panties as she sneers at us. Since the episodes don't tie into one another, there's not much to take away and the episodes are too short to care about anything. Four minutes forces the show into a sort of sour spot for me. It's too short for any proper buildup and it's so short that the buildup that _is_ there just comes across as a waste of time. Paradoxically, the run time combined with the small number of episodes prove to be the saving grace of the show. If the show was longer and was of the same quality, I'd have no qualms about calling this show bad. But as is, it's completely inoffensive. Sure, there are better things to watch, but at ~30 minutes to watch the entire thing, your day isn't ruined if you hated it. \n\nChances are you didn't, though. You saw the title, you saw the image. You knew exactly what you were getting into, and if you didn't enjoy it, you probably thought it was decent enough.\n\nThe character design was great and I felt the music disappearing when the women become disgusted was a nice touch.\n\n6/10"}, {"id": 3465, "score": 66, "body": "img(https://orig00.deviantart.net/f926/f/2018/253/c/6/akame_ga_kill__score_banner_by_overpowered99-dcmhxr6.png)\n\nPlunging into the abyss where gloom scatters about, Akame ga Kill! silhouettes against the sunlit opening. To watch is to enter an unpleasant territory full of dark elements. Now, you can interpret that unpleasantness in two ways. Whether that'd be the dreary experience or the thrilling bloodshed, both can pretty much describe the nature of this show.\n\nIn a world of darkness empowered by shadowy secrets and corruption, several assassins constitute a covert group with the motive of overthrowing the people who lead a crippling nation. Night Raid, the source that drives the story and many of its conflicts also introduces some predicaments into an otherwise solid premise. While the clich\u00c3\u00a9d characters are something I didn't mind much, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the execution that causes a lot of letdowns. The creators tried too hard to grip the audience. Here's the case. We have the powers of Teigu, relics of high calibers that pave way to fights of high action and risks. The apparent life or death fate of these fights is why when some ended in an anticlimactic fashion, any tension dissipates too quickly. Many deaths are burdened by the small amount of relatability in the characters, like more in-depth backstories, to create a more impactful consequence for us viewers. Feeling meaningless in the end, it only leaves a sour taste even if the fight is great. But those that depicts true clashes really shows how dangerous they are. No jokes, no playing around. Being serious is the way to survive and that's something that causes a lot of thrills here. Another good thing is the interactions between allies alike in both sides, antagonists included. The fact they have actual relationships between each other with ideals that mixed and matched give qualities that speak for the state of their world and for their own personal character. Romance, a side dish within the show, is supported by good events leading up to the influx of feelings but the suddenness is quite contrived, which fails to satisfy. For the comedy, the facetious attempts kicked me out of the serious atmosphere occasionally but some did managed to leave a bit of lightheartedness. This anime has no major world building as it focuses more on a condensed setting. Even so, at least it stayed true with its own violent and grim take on dark themes all the way from the start towards the end.\n\nExpanding on the darkness, the world is splattered with detailed redness that reinforces the gory violence this anime has set out for. First of all, the visual isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anything special but compare it to the narrative or character elements and it has more details at numerous times. This is particularly noticeable with the incredible close-ups of the character's face full of all kinds of expressions. Combined with the blood, brutality, and amputated limbs, you'll get something that trembles the tone with negative feelings. As for the animation, there are inconsistencies so the enjoyment varies. But together, it adds up into something pretty average. A few of the episodes are dedicated to intensified movements for the fights, coming in with great choreography and energy that expels out onto the unforeseen demise of whoever will lose. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s these fights and the different but cool appearances of the characters that factors in the badass sides of the show. They also go hand in hand with their Teigu powers, which have various designs to make each one a unique and special weapon capable of delivering deathly attacks in their own ways. Efforts for the voice-acting are sometimes hindered to full potential by the clumsy switches between seriousness and humor. It still didn't stray from the fact that they are able to express emotions to a successful degree. Anguish, anger, and pain can be heard coming out of their voices, along with care, friendliness, and relief. This show that the characters are still humans who possess varying feelings and ideologies, whether clashing with foes or matching with their friends. While the soundtracks aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the most golden part of the show, they are the ones that had the least amount of issues. I'd say they were effective in their uses. The collection of a variety of tracks blend in well with the mood of each scene, such as sorrow or excitement, without any obstruction.\n\nA show with great promises and buildups, Akame ga Kill! took several downfalls and redemptions throughout the whole journey, making it difficult to justify itself as a well-executed show. Too many times it had tried to forcefully crack emotions with the deaths it was not afraid to show, and the lackluster performance meant that a lot of the efforts fade away to the void. Despite that, it didn't come without enjoyment, and for a dark Shounen, is still a show that can excite with strong anticipations."}, {"id": 3472, "score": 50, "body": "Mary and the Witch's Flower was produced by Studio Ponoc, formed by former members of Studio Ghibli and directed by Academy Award-nominated Hiromasa Yonebayashi. It is based off of The Little Broomstick by the Scottish Mary Stewart, which is why it has a very Nothern atmosphere. Though originally released mid 2017 in Japan, Mary and the Witch's Flower only reached Australia on the 18th of January with dubs and subs both available.\n\n\nQuality\n\nAs to be expected from former Ghibli staff, the production quality is excellent. The character designs are well done and modern, the artwork and animation is very impressive and the soundtrack, by Takatsugu Muramatsu who also did the music for When Marnie Was There and Yuasa's Lu Over the Wall, is appropriate and grand. The soundtrack and visuals contribute greatly to the atmosphere and the impression we have of magic. The mark of a well directed movie is if it's easy to follow what is going on. An example of this concept done poorly is The Last Jedi, which was difficult to follow and was not exciting when exciting things were happening on screen. Mary and the Witch's Flower doesn't have any of those problems; the movie flows well and everything is clear.\n\nThe character of Mary is the polar opposite of Anna from When Marnie Was There (the Academy Award-nominated Yonebayashi film). Very energetic, tries to do everything, doesn't give up even when she's being a burden, etc. This works well to tell the story, especially since Mary is thrown into a place that she doesn't understand whatsoever. Willingness to try new things and having no earthly idea what is going on is a smart writing technique to introduce the world and important characters since it doesn't have to be preachy or on-the-nose with exposition. However, there is an exposition scene towards the end which didn't need to happen and opened up holes in the plot in the build up to that exposition. Unfortunately, although Mary works well as the lead, none of the other characters seem to have much to them. There are the generic antagonists who want more power but are technically not evil, the boy who will inevitably become important and befriend Mary, a plot convenience talking fox thing that shows up at suspiciously optimal times and solves too many problems for what little character he has, and Mary's grandmother who has two scenes and does nothing useful. Peter, who is an important plot point but a relatively uninspired character who didn't get enough screentime early on, has too much emotional payoff around him for how little he has to his character. This makes the climax slightly awkward.\n\nThe writing is on and off. Most of the plot is decent enough, but magic is poorly explained. This shouldn't normally be a problem, because magic isn't supposed to make sense, but the magic academy has some form of magic-infused science which has clear rules. Poorly explained magic in a world where there are rules and scientific principles is not excusable. Inconsistent uses of magic happen a fair amount in the latter half of the film and can detract from the immersion because of how noticeable it is. The motivations of the antagonists is directly related to the theme of the movie, which was that progress at all costs is a bad thing. The film deals with the antagonists in a goofy and whimsical way. There is quite a lot about the film that is whimsical, including character interactions between Peter and Mary, a joke which takes 45 minutes to finally get the punchline, any time Mary uses a broomstick or when there is an escape sequence. It's never a big issue but it wasn't balanced too well with the substantial parts of the movie, which were lacking.\n\n\nEntertainment Factor\n\nThis movie is primarily aimed at children and young girls. For that audience, Mary and the Witch's Flower will be a blast. The magic, thanks to the visuals and sound, is impressive and wondrous. The opening scene of the movie is exciting and the lighting is well done. It starts of the movie well, though it's a big tonal shift going from exciting magic to watching an ordinary 12 year old girl do ordinary things. There's enough going on in the plot that you probably won't get bored.\n\nThe problems come with the inconsistencies with magic and the plot holes accompanying them. They can ruin the immersion, take you out of the scene and annoy you. The exposition scene towards the end is another mistake because it involved telling us things we already knew. The exposition is likely necessary for children to understand how scenes connect, but the exposition didn't tell us anything we didn't know or anything we needed to know. As far as exposition goes, it was poor. The most fun parts of the movie are where magic is being used to do all sorts of cool things. Luckily, this is the entire second half of the movie.\n\n\nOverall Message\n\nThe core messages were along the lines of \"progress at all costs is not worth it\" and \"you shouldn't change yourself for the sake of change\". The messages were clear and shown visually in the latter half. They are well executed because they aren't preachy about it and don't monologue about what the message is and what they learned. For the intended audience, the messages are appropriate and could apply directly to them.\n\nThere are some smaller messages, like that you shouldn't abandon what you care about, not to ab use power and that you should take responsibility for the things you cause, but they aren't emphasised at all and are off cuts of the main meal. Of course, there is that one scene where a cow-person is carving up some meat to serve as food, which is quite morally reprehensible. Mary and the Witch's Flower is simple and you shouldn't expect anything else. It does enough to be engaging and somewhat impressive, but not enough to be fantastic and has too many flaws to become a classic or cult-classic.\n\n\nShould you really watch Mary and the Witch's Flower?\n\nYes. Yes you should."}, {"id": 3505, "score": 60, "body": "__Story__: Junji Ito Collection is a horror anthology based on short stories by Junji Ito. Each episode has at least two stories, most self contained, others within a short continuity. Here's my recommendation list; Long Dreams, The Crossroads Pretty Boy, Slug Girl, Shiver, Gentle Goodbye, Window Next Door, Greased and Smashed. The less you know about these stories the better. They contain elements that range from paranormal horror to body horror. \n\n__Sound/Music__: The OP grabbed me from the start. Really gets you hyped to dive in, but I don't think it's one I'll remember or listen to after finishing the series. As for the ED, I couldn't find myself sticking around to listen to it, which is a shame since it sounded okay from what little I heard. I felt that the stories worked better without the music since it rarely, if ever, added to the narrative. The music that was used was generic to say the least. I personally couldn't remember a single track used. The voice acting in some episodes certainly helped to set the tone far better than any music. Certain iconic characters had voices that were fitting to them, although the one-off narrators offered the best performances. \n\n__Art/Animation__: If you take a look at some gifs of the show, the animation can be very stunning at times, sometimes even unsettling! But these moments were so few and far between it leaves you just hoping you'll catch glimpses every few minutes. There were instances were it felt as if several artists worked on a single episode, given only a few frames to animate. The quality of the show is highly inconsistent, laughably bad to just downright unfinished in some instances. Maybe it was due to budget constraints or poor directing but some episodes feel very unprofessionally done. Character expressions at times are very limited. Despite the attempts to capture Ito's style, the series' art direction was often inconsistent and jarring.  Additionally, this series was based on body horror and gore. However, this is another element that rarely utilized to its potential. Attempts to hide the more violent scenes are not done in a way that adds to the suspense and violent scenes that are shown are rarely detailed enough to be considered \"scary\". The stories' narratives alone are usually what drive you to keep watching. \n\nAs a Junji Ito fan I was disappointed to say the least. I was excited to finally see these works adapted with the kind of care and passion they deserve. That's mostly what kept me going through the episodes. You can see glimmers of a good adaptation here and that's what's so disheartening. Nevertheless, I don't think this is a complete throwaway, there still some weirdness to discover if you're willing to work through its flaws. If at least one episode sparks your curiosity while watching, I cannot recommend Junji Ito's work more to you. "}, {"id": 3516, "score": 55, "body": "Short OVA's all seem to suffer from the same issues for me personally. And that is they never give the characters or story enough time to develop, I never grow attached to the characters or care about what is occurring with the story. And Blue Submarine No. 6 is no different in these same ways. Everything from episode 1 feels incredibly rushed with no time dedicated to the characters or world. \n\nThe characters all seem to have the same style backstory, tragic past involving dead family so they wish to kill the sea monsters. That is it, that is everyone's main story in a single sentence. Even the main villain has a very similar backstory. It makes it all feel depressing sure, all these people on a quest of revenge and survival against these monsters. But at the same time makes it very shallow, you can't build an entire cast on the same basic idea and definitely not in 4 episodes. A couple characters get some very basic character development, but nothing I could consider incredible. The main development would be Hayami Tetsu, the mysterious Ace pilot who becomes curious about the monsters. He still gets the tragic backstory like the rest, but is given a bit more development to flesh him out a bit more. The other major development is Kino Mayumi, whose main development seems to be overcoming a pursuit of revenge and falling in love. A love I have to mention that seems to be the most shoehorned thing in history, you can't make me feel like characters fell in love with a sentence here and there. Verg the enemy leader gets last minute development, and I mean last minute, his development happens in the last 5ish minutes. Myutio a female sea monster gets her 5 minutes of development as well, helping Hayami and maybe making him understand them better, I think that was her point at least. \n\nNow I want to mention the main villain, Jung Zorndyke. Well I don't know if they were actually trying to make him a true villain, more like a misguided man who wanted to be a Hero in his own twisted way. He thought be doing his actions he could save humanity and make the planet a better place, and if that failed allow it be given to something new. \nI feel like this falls apart though once you look at the way he behaves~! He constantly says that he isn't a God, he is just a man. But then has his creations worship him like some divine being. He didn't like humans taking over the planet the way they were, seemingly believing them to be greedy. But he then proceeds to creation new creatures that wage war, and behave just like humans. And never once does he seem to be remorseful in what he did. He doesn't seem sad that he kills billions of humans, and created a warlike race. Or convinced and allow thousands of creatures to warship him as God. Overall I just feel like his character was pretty poorly explored..!~\n\nThe animation in the show I felt was decent enough, as long as they didn't use the CGI in the scene. But that was apparently a very difficult thing for them to achieve. The amount of very poor and horrible looking CGI reminds me of pre-rendered PS2 cutscenes. With the fps seemingly in single digits at times, and very low art quality on the CGI. Overall all the terrible CGI just takes away so much from scenes that might have been cool. A decent underwater fight becomes something you can't help but laugh at when viewing these CGI blobs move around the scene. I wish I could view this 20 years ago, and see what I would think of it based on other stuff available. But unfortunately that isn't possible, and I have to look at it as somebody who can't ignore bad CGI no matter the year it was created. \n\nThe music was pretty good, felt like it did a good job. With different styles depending on who was on the screen at the time. Made the music feel like it was flowing well with the scenes and what was occurring. \n\nThe Story wasn't incredible, kinda felt like a Climate Change story before it really was a major theme in shows. A flooded planet due to melted ice caps, and genetic engineering changing the planet to fit our needs being bad. Felt like it was kinda weak in the end, with just not enough time put towards developing the story alongside the characters. Instead a bunch of story is given in the last episode by the main villain and didn't impress me. \n\n"}, {"id": 3534, "score": 65, "body": "Mushi-shi is a conceptually fantastic and elegant story that challenges traditional tropes and patterns while still using a common medium that anyone could understand. While fighting the paradigm can be an open door to critical acclaim and widespread popularity, the actual enjoyability of the show can suffer for it.\n\nThe beginning starts out very strong, with the main character Ginko traveling around this strange medieval-technology land littered with the natural, meddling spirits called Mushi, that very few people can see and even fewer still can deal with. Concepts are creative, execution is relaxing but occasionally unsettling, visuals are, at times, alien and heavy-handed, but they still combine to form a strange, beautiful work that blends in with the natural scenes. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to be wrapped up in Ginko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s world, because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s believable and wonderful, like a painting of a forest. \n\nHowever, when the illusion of realism leaves your dulled eyes and you come out of your Mush-shi induced coma, you may start to realize that despite the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to steal your time away from you, half of the show is boring drivel that you fail to notice due to distractions. \n\nFlashbacks for context begin to take up a third, or an entire half of certain episodes. Ginko, the titular Mushi-shi, loses relevance and becomes his own deus ex machina. Mushi problems boil down to a set of specific commands that always happen. Here is a formula if you ever want to watch it and see:\n\n1. A problem is introduced. (Disease, loss of a sense, deformed birth, annoyance, natural disaster, food issue, memory)\n2. Ginko determines that the cause is a Mushi that practically only he can see.\n3. The problem is either solved by Ginko, resolves itself, does not need resolving, or cannot be resolved. Credits roll.\n\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the entire show. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it. Throw in perhaps 3 flashback episodes of Ginko as a child, and there you have all 49 episodes of Mushi-shi. There is no recurring plot. Every episode is an episodic vignette into some villager or tradesman or Ginko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life. Even Ginko does not always appear, and often he is not even the solution to the problem. \n\nThis brings my main point: Mushi-shi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focus was, after watching all of it, never on Ginko, never on just humans. It was all about nature, the entire time. Every episode is a metaphor for living with nature, appreciating nature, fearing it, respecting it, maintaining relationships with it. This is not a bad thing, by any means! This is a beautiful point to focus on, and one that needs more attention. It is not sensationalist nor pretentious. It is thoughtful and considerate, kind and profound. But as a relatively long-form show, counting to 46 episodes and 3 special, longer episodes? It becomes very dull at times, and loses some merit as a show. As a novel or comic, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s understandable that one reading such a contemplative series would want to take his time and seriously consider concepts such as respect of nature. As a show, as something _enjoyable_, Mushi-shi fails.\n"}, {"id": 3540, "score": 55, "body": "(Very minor spoilers.)\nWitch Craft Works is an incredibly visually appealing anime with great character designs and concepts that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t used all that well, and up us as a kind of boring, sloppy mess that masquerades as your average battle romcom. \n\nThe premise is that of two people- a guy who is unknowingly the \u00e2\u0080\u009cChosen One,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and a girl who is his knowing fated protector. They have a typical princess/knight dynamic, except the princess is the guy and the knight is the girl. This seems like it should be one of the more interesting concepts, but\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it goes nowhere. The guy is just generally a useless softie who wants to be better, and the girl is your average kuudere school idol- perfect grades, trained in every martial art, perfect at everything _except_ expressing her feelings\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 \n\nEverything is pretty. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Senran Kagura-level of creative and memorable design on the characters, and while most of the scenery is typical high school/Japanese city, the few times (2 or 3 that I can remember) they go into magical \u00e2\u0080\u009cwitch\u00e2\u0080\u009d areas, the landscapes are absolutely enthralling and magical, in a pastel, harmless way. (Fair warning: there IS CG in this anime. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s used very little beyond the beginning arc, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not terribly bad or distracting. I kind of like it.)\n\nHowever, how everything is used\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 is not terribly creative. Most of the episodes jump between two conflicts- that of the main guy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role as the Chosen One, and as a magic user (\u00e2\u0080\u009cmagic plots\u00e2\u0080\u009d), and that of the main couple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship, either in training or daily life (\u00e2\u0080\u009cromcom plots\u00e2\u0080\u009d). The magic plots are usually action-heavy and dramatic, while the romcom plots tend towards slice-of-life banter and ___very___ light ecchi. The comedy lands pretty often, for what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth, and the slice of life parts that revolve around the main couple are lighthearted and entertaining. \n\nThe action, though? The magical abilities are actually quite captivating, with each witch using a specific style of magic that suits their design. The problem is that they show their hand far too early. A villain (?) who assaults the protagonists displays a beautiful aquatic magic power (in the first 2-4 episodes) that pretty much blows any other effect in this anime out of the water. Also, the main girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abilities are also shown very quickly, with her having different \u00e2\u0080\u009cforms\u00e2\u0080\u009d that reflect how serious she is.\n\nAnd that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the main problem with this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pacing. It jumps between plots, tones, and intensity far too fast, but with consistency. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be sitting through a slice of life segment, and be saying to yourself \u00e2\u0080\u009cok where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the conflict that will put this on pause?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Or during an action segment you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll dread the imminent cutaway gag from the comic relief that breaks that dramatic tension so carefully created by great villains. (For what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth, all the villains\u00e2\u0080\u0099 designs and fight sequences are excellent. Their motivations? Pretty much non-existent.)\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 bad. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen a whole lot worse. It pretty much only switches between 2 tones, and the ending arc is serious all the way through. But I much prefer the slice-of-life segments. Framing this as more of a romance or slice of life (in the vein of Oh My Goddess, or hell, Maid Dragon) would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been a lot better, and a lot more conducive to the ensemble cast of villains and heroes. Seriously, having like 10 separate good witches and like 5 separate bad witches that are fleshed out nigh-equally is just horrible for a 12-episode anime! The focus is spread equally among every character who isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u009cmain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and every single one hurts for it. The sister is a bland brocon, the 5-person Team Rocket witch team literally never do anything productive (ignoring a tiny element near the end, that ended up being unnecessary), and the chairwoman\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 what, honestly did she do? Dang it, you have some good characters. USE THEM. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use them as bait for flashbacks, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t waste them in one-off fights or gags, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t restrict their character to one trait. You did fine with the main couple, why limit yourself? There are great ensemble cast series that actually flesh out a wide array of personalities and ideas. Jitsu wa Watashi wa (manga) is a great example- varying amounts of time were spent on each character to help them fit into the environment and realistically involve themselves in future story arcs. If a character is overall useless, or going to be\u00e2\u0080\u0094 let them be, look, and act one-bit. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fool your viewers into liking or hoping for the spotlight on characters that are just going to be background butt monkeys.\n\n5.5/10. Bonus points for that catchy ED.

Here's a link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWmf9zO83y8 )\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an art film about a 27-year old, stuck on her past as a 10-year old, finding her way in life. It hits a lot of beats typical of these kinds of stories, with a feeling of spiritualism and meandering, while culminating at an emotional head, where she finally \u00e2\u0080\u009cchooses\u00e2\u0080\u009d the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbetter life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This turns out to be problematic in execution.\n\nThere are two halves of this movie- the older Taeko, and the child Taeko. The film is told as older reminiscing about younger, but it feels\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 off. We see very little of older Taeko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life beyond her working at the farm, and we exclusively see a specific age of the younger, 5th grade, 10 years old. This is both unrealistic and harmful, as some of the young segments end up feeling pointless or strange, even if they are meant to be wandering memories.\n\nIt is beautiful, no doubt. The motion and facial expression, for 1991, is impressive and charming, and the waterpainted backdrops are breathtaking. The music is mostly borrowed from Eastern European folk songs, which is odd, but it works well in context.\n\nI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but feel a level of disappointment that so much time is spent on her memories rather than her current life. I felt a disconnect- that the people were so thoroughly divorced from each other. There was absolutely nothing shown in those 17 years that rationalize or help the audience understand how she has gone from her traditional family life, her troubles with school, and her stubborn personality, to the mature self in the future. We see no dissatisfaction with city life, we exclusively hear the older self saying basic things like \u00e2\u0080\u009cI feel at home in the country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I guess when the younger wanted to go on vacation she just wanted to go the country? Which is symbolic I guess? But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mentioned once and never again.\n\nOverall, most of the younger segments feel unnecessary, and I much prefer the older segments. The best example of this is that at the end credits, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a beautiful montage of her reconsidering her life in the train, with her young self and friends watching in the back of her mind, but physically present. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beautiful, a perfect representation of growing up and moving on. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only once. It should\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been the entire film. Rather than constantly cut to jarring and unfitting flashbacks, why not make the distances between the two eras even closer? Why not make the whole film literally drift between past and present? It feels like a waste.\n\nI think I get the film. I get the theme, I get some of the functions as both a period piece and a sort of older coming-of-age, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like it, and I feel like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not executed as well as it could be. 6/10."}, {"id": 3553, "score": 55, "body": "Happy Sugar Life is a tragedy. I mean this in both literary and quality terms. Despite how interestingly and enticingly crafted this tragic tale is, and how effectively some of its presentation is, this show has one fatal flaw: overemphasis. One wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that this is so catastrophic, but Happy Sugar Life proves why \u00e2\u0080\u009cshow, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a thing.\n\nThere are two forms of this devastating lingering. The first one is the monologuing. This is what damages Satou as a character and drags this anime down and out beyond belief. Her personality is interesting, almost as if you put a mary sue and a yandere in a blender and watched them eat away at each other in the process of having an overprotective pedo lesbian try to keep her image and ideal life intact. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to care when the majority of her screen time is spent in her headspace, as she monologues about damn near everything. Regardless of what anyone thinks of this tragic hero on a moral level, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to see how this can feel grating and unnecessary. These scenes of her expositing her thoughts on any given situation can go on for minutes on end when almost every single time, her expressions alone are enough to tell us next to, if not everything she is thinking and feeling. \n\nShrinking it all down to a sentence or two maximum to clarify something or truly encapsulate a scene for her, and letting the visuals do the rest would have been far more rewarding. It would have truly taken advantage of the imaginatively disturbing directing and presentation, both making Satou a far more interesting lead to follow, and making several scenes to be far more impactful and dramatic. It would have also kept a myriad of scenes from dragging out to more than double the length they needed to convey everything properly. Keep in mind that this applies to several scenes from several characters later on as well. You could cut down entire episodes worth of monologuing and probably improved the pacing dramatically, both in terms of an episode structure and scene-by-scene basis. The worst part of all is that the show understands this to an extent, with some of the most critical and stylistic scenes in the latter half of the show truly showcasing how powerful this approach can be.\n\nThe second devastating, drawn-out form of overemphasis is a more gratuitous, self-indulgent kind. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what destroys practically everyone else in this show. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no secret that the vast majority of the characters in this show are damaged, mostly reprehensible people. You can show that off while keeping the audience engaged and disturbed in a proper way. This show takes the worst approach possible with this. Whenever a character is established doing something fucked up, we linger on them licking something, drooling, and/or panting after sniffing something for extended periods of time or interacting with their target in some way. At that point, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more tiresome than creepy, and more aggravating than repulsive. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even worse when the show constantly reminds you of this with small moments and scenes that add nothing and could be cut out entirely. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bad enough that the progression of certain characters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 descent into pedophilic or stalker-like madness is utterly nonsensical, but when that becomes their defining trait, and when the show just lingers on about it, it becomes a nightmare to sit through for the worst reasons imaginable. \n\nTo really paint a picture of how bad this can get, a male police officer is sexually assaulted for minutes on end, with several characters watching, and it takes his partner so long to intervene. On top of that, all they do is leave, rather than arrest the perpetrator or do anything for committing a crime of sexual assault on an on-duty police officer. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beyond wild how bad the gaps in logic are, and how much this show just wants to linger on the more disturbing elements for its own self-indulgent, narrative and character-damaging purposes. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure if any of this was the fault of the material, the director/screenwriter, or both.\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pity, really. Outside of all of this, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an interesting, enticing tragedy at play, with some truly potent moments, both sweet and sour. The reveals are paced out well and tend to be brutal. The core narrative is theoretically engaging without too many glaring issues in terms of logic or consistency. On the audiovisual side, the visuals by newcomer studio Ez\u00cf\u008cla can be incredibly imaginative, even if their background and CGI endeavors are sometimes distracting and needless. The disconcerting feel the directing and imagery go for is a sight to behold. The music is generally good at bolstering emotional scenes with their own melancholic and beautiful tunes. The ED theme -\"SWEET HURT\" by ReoNa- deserves special mention in that regard. If the show just showed more restraint and used its artistic flair to more consistently tell its story properly, I genuinely believe this would have been one of the better shows I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen all year.

While this special was carefully made to blend in with the original episode and give a subtle peak at what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to come, it forgets one very important thing: to properly cement itself as an ending of Steins;Gate.\n\n# Review in full:\n\nI've always felt that episode 23 was one of Steins;Gate's best episodes. Re-visiting the events of episode 1 and revealing just how much was actually going on gave credence to the sudden turn of events at the end of episode 22, and Okabe mustering the strength to try one last time to set things right despite all that he had been through was one of his defining moments. Heck, what Okabe ended up having to do by the end of it to succeed was one of the defining moments of the entire show. The reason I consider Steins;Gate to have a good ending, or even an acceptable ending, is because of how episode 23 played out.\n\nOf course, the reason this alternate version of episode 23 exists is to show where the path splits to allow Steins;Gate 0 to happen. It certainly looks and feels like it came straight out of the original show despite being made four years later, and considering the original's quality it's impressive that way. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on display here cements it as being just as much a part of this Steins;Gate as it is a part of Steins;Gate 0.\n\nFor that same reason it's somewhat understandable for it to reuse 2/3rds of the original episode 23, but it doesn't leave itself much time to show the difference. Maintaining the old episode until the path splits gives it authenticity, but it should have allowed itself to be longer than a standard episode to fully explore its alternate direction because it leaves a few gaps in its wake. It ends up feeling like a partial showing, one that was meant to create confusion rather than provide resolution.\n\n~~~**Spoilers for both this special and the original Steins;Gate below.**~~~\n\n<center>~!First of all, there's no particular reason given as to why Mayuri decides to comfort Okabe after his failed attempt to save Kurisu instead of snap him out of his depressive state like she did in the original. Every other time different events have occurred at the same point in time in this series (aside from Okabe meddling with them using time travel of course) it's been across two different world lines, whereas that isn't the case this time. Meanwhile Suzuha does nothing to change what's going on despite knowing that the failed attempt was necessary and that future Okabe was going to send a message to the past with further details (details she seems to have known herself even!)\n\nimg600(https://i.imgur.com/onGvXXy.png)\n_The high audiovisual quality and attention to key details in this scene give a glance of just how powerful this alternate episode could have been if it was cohesive throughout._\n\nDespite these unanswered plot-holes, this special nails the sense of failure Okabe initially finds himself drowning in. His loss and regret are strikingly portrayed, and it only took a couple scenes to convey this thanks to the ever-well coordinated and fitting visuals and sound work. Then, as depressed as Okabe is that night, we don't get to see how he brings himself to recover in the next month or two, which is a shame because Okabe simply doesn't receive the extra development he did in the original (and for that matter Mayuri really didn't either since we already knew her nurturing side.)!~</center>\n\n~~~**No more spoilers beyond this point.**~~~\n\nWe get to see what Okabe becomes as a result of this alternate experience, which is important in its own right and got the attention it needed, but without a smooth transition it ends up looking like Okabe suddenly wiped his memory to alter his habits instead of consciously changing himself as life continued around him. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel right, and with no indication that he intends to revert him back to the way he was it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel intentional either. Fate might have other plans for him of course, especially with how this special ends (or rather teases the beginning of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to come) but the unnatural presentation of Okabe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self-change still left a sour aftertaste.\n\n# Verdict:\n\nI can appreciate this special for how it bridges Steins;Gate to the new story to come but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not pleased with the one-way nature of it.  By lacking the story detail needed to provide proper closure it fails to be the keystone that the original episode 23 was to Steins;Gate.  It works well as Steins;Gate 0 episode 0 but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a proper ending to Steins;Gate despite containing the plot and production values to have managed it with the proper direction & length.  By both showing Okabe try to leave this special\u00e2\u0080\u0099s events and not showing what led him to that course of action, episode 23 \u00ce\u00b2 forgets some of the elements it needed to be cohesive and comprehensive, even if the rest is well-presented."}, {"id": 3564, "score": 50, "body": "__What is Jashin-chan Dropkick?__\n\nJashin-chan Dropkick is a slapstick anime that tries being innovative by mixing Comedy elements\nwith gore. This is something that isn't often used so it had the potential to turn out great,\ntoo bad that it didn't. \n\n__Why do you say that?__\n\nThe fault lies within the Comedy factor. The jokes are repetitive in a cycling way. \nThe same joke is being proposed in a different sauce every few episodes, that makes the punchlines\neasy to predict and you know more or less where every gag is headed.\nWhat this anime was good at is the Meta Humor. The anime used for the meta jokes are popular so it's \neasy to get the references and that makes them more appreciable. The self-references were pretty good too.\n\n__Apart from that, was the rest good though?\n__\n\nThe problems don't reside only within the average-quality humor.\nAnother problem lies withing the Opening song. Both the OP and ED songs were fine, nothing exceptional but\nthey did their job, the thing is that in this anime they decided that in the first episode\nno character would be introduced, no backstory on what happened and the viewer would have to get the\nessential information from the OP, mostly from the visuals plus lyrics, \nsee the \"I can't go back unless I kill her\" or the \"I have to get my halo back\". \nBut even those tiny bits of information aren't enoguh so you have\nto go head-on in the gags without a proper introduction of every character.\n\n__Speaking of characters, what do you think of them?\n__\n\nThe characters are the core of those kind of anime.\nThe main characters are Jashin-chan and Yurine.\nYurine is a girl that wears goth clothes and has somehow summoned Jashin-chan in this world.\nShe should be a central figure but she's more like a secondary character. Her only job is to \npunish Jashin-chan for her rather weak and pathetic attempts of murder in the most gruesome ways,\nthat's the only reason for this show Gore tag. You have no idea of the background of Yurine.\nIs she a student? Does she work? Family? Is she into the occult? Nothing. No idea.\n\nJashin-chan is a viper-like devil that can't go back to hell unless she kills Yurine.\nNo one seems remotely bothered by the fact that she's an half-naked viper going around.\nAnd there's no trick like \"normal human beings can't see her devil form\", people actually call her viper too.\nShe is the real Main character of the anime as 90% of the times the situation revolves around her. \nSadly she's pathetic. She's greedy, gluttonous, evil, lies a lot, badmouths\neveryone, they really put an effort to make her as obnoxious as possible. As the show goes by it's also\nshown that there's something good in her, deep inside her heart, but really deep.\nThe Supporting cast is instead quite likeable, for the ones that have a name at least.\n\nFirst one is Medusa, a devil with such strong petrifying powers that has to go outside with a shopping bag.\nEven though she has those powers Yurine isn't affected in the less. No idea why.\nMedusa is the counterpart of Jashin-chan, she is the most likeable character of the show, caring, gently, trusting,\nnever blames the others and spoils Jashin-chan no end. Seemingly she's extremely rich. Again, no idea why, \neven the most trivial of reasons would've been a better reason than nothing.\nShe's Jashin-chan's childhood friend.\n\nMinosu is the other childhood friend, apparently she lives in the same building complex of Jashin and Yurine and,\nonce again, that was something prior to the anime's starting point.\nShe's the typical all brawn no brain character but still more smart than our main character.\n\nWe also have angels here, Pekore is the first fallen angel, she supposedly lost her halo so that she can't go\nback to heaven, I know I'll end up being repetitive but this was only shown in the OP.\nSince she has lost her halo and the powers that came with it she now has to survive on Earth while only relying\none herself. All of the gags involving her are about her being starved and reluctantly accepting Yurine's food\nor about the struggles of being extremely poor. This would've been okay if it wasn't always the same thing or at least\nnot shown once every two episodes.

While it can seem daunting, people who want to get into it can take solace in the fact that given the number of entries, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a show for everyone. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re like me and enjoy dark and gritty stories, you can watch Zeta Gundam, Victory Gundam, or Iron-Blooded Orphans. If you want something more lighthearted, you may be inclined to watch something such as ZZ or Build Fighters.\n\nGundam Build Divers is definitely more on the lighthearted spectrum. As someone whose favorite Gundam shows are the three aforementioned \u00e2\u0080\u009cdark\u00e2\u0080\u009d entries, you might be inclined to believe that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d write off this show without giving it a chance. While it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true that this type of Gundam show is somewhat alien to me, I was willing to give it a chance, and if it had many merits, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love it, lighthearted or no.\n\nGundam Build Divers is centered around Gundam Build Nexus - an MMORPG  based around Gunpla. The main characters frequent the real-life Odaiba Gundam Base (most notable for its Gundam Unicorn Statue). This was by far my biggest draw to the show. As a big Gundam fan, the concept of a Gundam MMO proved fun to think about. The possibilities are endless. Gundam Build Divers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cameos were great as well. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a fan of Gundam, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be sure to see a reference to series you love. They even paid tribute to the box art for the Linkin Park Gundam!\nimg220(https://i.redd.it/qiv8dvppe3g11.jpg)\nimg220(https://i0.wp.com/thefanboyseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/FB_IMG_1534244395311.jpg?resize=285%2C400)\n\nSo, besides fanservice, what does Gundam Build Divers bring to the table? \n\nNot much, unfortunately.\n\nThe very thing I praised the show for, its setting, is one of the biggest things that annoyed me. Maybe Recovery of an MMO Junkie spoiled me, but GBN often doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel like a game. While it can be forgiven in that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a VR game, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still ridiculous for characters to act hurt or hungry, only to remember that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in a video game (multiple times). \n\nGBN  murders any tension the show tries to foster. Because GBN is a game, there aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any _real _stakes, so it was hard for me to get invested. Game concepts aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t brought up nearly enough, and thus, while more than an afterthought, it felt like GBN was deemed not worthy of exploring. \n\nWhat _does_ Build Divers deem worthy of exploring, you ask? The characters. Unfortunately, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still \"explored\" about as well as other galaxies. The story primarily follows Riku, the blandest Gundam protagonist I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had the displeasure of following. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty much your generic middle-school shounen protagonist who converts friendship into the energy needed to tear through each and every obstacle that has the misfortune of being in his way. The shrivel of tension that exists in the show is brutalized by Riku, who, past the intro episodes, becomes a nigh-unstoppable force, making the show quite boring. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bad sign that, more often than not, I was rooting for Riku to get his just-desserts. I came to roll my eyes whenever a character spoke of a low success rate, because I knew Riku would pull through all the same. It was extremely unrealistic to see Riku, a total newbie, absolutely brutalize most of his competition.\n\nAnd if you thought Riku was too bland, Build Divers has you covered with Sarah - a mysterious girl whose sole purpose in this anime is to stand around looking cute. The less I talk about Sarah, the better.\n\nThe other characters don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t add much, though a lot of them do end up being more enjoyable than the main bunch. Though I must say, as far as the main group go, Ayame is a saving grace.\n\nAgain, battles aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that important in Gundam Build Divers. Sure, characters like to do battle, but nothing is really at stake with losing. While some of the Gunpla look quite cool, a lot of the battles lacked a certain \u00e2\u0080\u009cumph,\u00e2\u0080\u009d for a lack of a better term. My favorite challenges were actually the capture the flag events, probably because they added something new to the mix. The ending of the show has a really nice one, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too little too late.\n\nI wanted to like this show, especially since I began it with a friend, yet it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do anything for me. It was hard to drag myself to watch another episode, and it felt like a chore. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really find the show funny, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find the action exciting, the characters were boring, and the story was anything but gripping. The only saving grace was - due to being a glorified commercial - the copious amount of fanservice, but even if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a Gundam fan, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not really worth the watch.\n\n5.4/10\n\nSuffice to say, while I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m wary about calling the show terrible, it was quite mediocre. \n"}, {"id": 3594, "score": 60, "body": "Hoshi no Kaabii (\"Kirby of the Stars\", which is the Kirby game series' official Japanese name) is a 100-episode anime series starring Nintendo's popular pink puff-ball. The game series is designed to be incredibly simple, with the goal of being easy for beginners to pick up and enjoy. This doesn't mean the games don't include plenty of challenge for experienced players, because trust me, they do, but the anime decides to keep things simple and target the young children that the series appeals to so well. Since the games have very little lore or story, creative liberties were taken by the show's production staff in order to create a world in which to tell these children's stories, so what you get is a new universe that's heavily inspired by the lore of the games, yet still manages to feel unique and separate. Older fans of the series may find this slightly disappointing, but that's to be expected from a show that isn't directed at that older audience.\nThe main issue with the anime is that it doesn't contain much in terms of story or character development. It's a \"monster-of-the-week\"-type anime where, similar to a sitcom, characters don't change from episode-to-episode (apart from the show's beginning and ending, which are definitely heavier on story). The good guys and bad guys both go through trouble and learn morals as they go, but while the good guys learn from it, the slapstick baddies always ignore the lessons and go back to being their regular selves, which makes the show feel pointless. That's not to say that's a bad thing, though. For its intended audience, the show is perfect. It's light-hearted, funny, has action scenes in each episode, and best of all, has top-notch animation that stay consistent throughout the entirety of the 100-episode series, although it's a little disappointing that character models switch from 2D to 3D animation from time-to-time. I assume they do it for simple convenience, which is why it seems so random, but for an anime released in 2001, the 3D implementation is actually fairly impressive, so it's forgivable in my eyes. All in all, its a show that's definitely worthy of that Nintendo Seal of Quality! The only question is, will older viewers be as entertained as those that the series was intended for? In my honest opinion, even middle schoolers won't find anything of much interest in the show. While I'm not saying its a bad watch, I'm saying that there's far more worthy shows out there that you could be watching instead. Don't waste your time with this one unless you're watching the tube with someone who's the right age for it.\nOf course, I can't end the review without mentioning the Western edit of the show, handled by 4Kids Entertainment, named \"Kirby: Right Back At Ya!\". Since the show was originally meant for such a young audience, 4Kids was never able to popularize the series in the West among 7-12 years olds, which was the usual demographic for cartoons of the sort. Surprisingly enough, however, all 100 episodes still aired on TV, although it's quite difficult to find them all now, since only a handful were ever released on video, and Nintendo, the current distributor of the series' following 4Kids' bankruptcy, hasn't seen fit to permanently re-release the anime in any physical or digital form (although they had done temporary re-releases of certain episodes in the past through various Wii/3DS applications). That being said, the Western adaption is quite similar to the Japanese original, despite the usual edits made to all of 4Kids' dubs. I really like the authenticity of the Japanese original, which promotes the series' excellent production values and also features music identical to the Kirby Air Ride video game of the day, which I thought was an awesome touch. Despite that, I also enjoyed many of the changes made to the English version: the voices and personas applied to Dedede and Escargoon (the series' main \"baddies\", of sorts) are a lot more fun, adding to their slapstick charm, and to top it all off, it has one of the most fun cartoon theme songs of all-time. This is great news for English viewers, because let's be honest: your kindergarten-aged kids probably aren't going to want to read subtitles. \nThe score below is written with the older audience in mind, since they're the ones reading the review. In my books, it's a must-watch if in the 90's, worth watching if in the 80's, casually enjoyable if in the 70's, and not a complete write-off if in the 60's. With a 60/100, I'd say that the show definitely isn't for you, but it may be great for your kids or siblings. "}, {"id": 3595, "score": 69, "body": "Sonic X is a 78-episode anime series based on the Sonic The Hedgehog video game series. For those who aren't familiar with it, the games follow Sonic, a blue, talking hedgehog that can run at the speed of sound, who fights the evil Dr. Eggman, a mad scientist who desires to conquer the world, and in doing so, turns Sonic's friends in robots and pollutes Sonic's home. These fights are usually waged over the powerful and coveted Chaos Emeralds, which are seven gems that, when all brought together, provide the user with unlimited power. The anime series doesn't stray from that concept. It starts with Eggman having collected all of the emeralds to power a doomsday machine, which Sonic damages so that when activated, it sends them all to an alternate dimension, that dimension being that of our own planet earth. From this point on, Sonic meets up with a 12-year-old boy named Chris, whose grandfather welcomes him and his friends into their home to help them find the emeralds once more in order to find a way back home. The series follows a number of original story arcs, alongside adaptations of the Sonic Adventure, Sonic Adventure 2, and Sonic Battle video games. The third and final season of the show a story unlike anything the series has ever received, where the crew venture into space to battle the evil Metarex: robotic monsters that are terrorizing planets, seeking to rule to galaxy. The story has a much darker tone to it than anything the series has ever received, even to this day.\nThe Sonic series only delivers so much in terms of storytelling, so this anime is an essential watch for anyone who considers themselves a fan of the series. That doesn't mean that it's anything too, too special though, do bear in mind. Production quality changes from episode to episode: big, important episodes are very well animated, while everything in-between can range from decent, to acceptable, to straight up horrible, with poorly drawn character models being a constant source of contention. Character development only ever happens to a handful of characters, and only ever happens when an arc reaches its conclusion. This means that the show is mostly a generic children's action anime, which, if you're into the series and its characters, is still worth a watch, even if you aren't nine years old. Like I said earlier, if you're a fan of the series, the show has some great stories and awesome moments that you absolutely need to watch, even if there's a lot of generic kids'-show filler to round out the majority of the experience.\nNow, I can't end the review without mentioning the Western adaption, handled by 4Kids Entertainment. 4Kids is known for taking series and injecting a more \"Western\" flavour to it, changing the overall tone and dialogue to feel more like your typical American Saturday-morning cartoon. In the case of Sonic X, it makes the series feel a little more juvenile, but it definitely makes for a far more entertaining watch. The original Japanese series is honestly pretty boring, with the English dub opting to give the characters more comedic personalities, which fits right in with the Sonic franchise--a franchise that doesn't take itself very seriously in general, and that's a good thing. For this reason, I recommend sticking with the dub. Besides, if you're a fan of the games, you'll recognize all the voice actors, since they appeared in the games from 2005 through 2009 (granted, they aren't games I would recommend playing...those years were dark times for the Sonic series...).\nIn my books, an anime is a must-watch if in the 90's, worth watching if in the 80's, casually enjoyable if in the 70's, and not a complete write-off if in the 60's. At a 69/100, I'd say that the show definitely isn't for everyone, but middle schoolers and fans of the series should definitely check it out."}, {"id": 3620, "score": 50, "body": "~~~img500(https://i.imgur.com/CNe0C82.jpg)\n~~~\n\n~~~Spoiler-free review~~~\nI tend to like weird anime. It usually means they are different, unique, something to change it up. Hinamatsuri started off weird enough to catch my interest, but then turned the dial up to 11 and dropped any sort of meaningful storyline/foundation that the first two episodes seemed to create.\n\nThe idea of the show sounds great. A girl with super powers mysteriously appears in the home of a Yakuza member, who now has to take care of her while preventing the destruction of his apartment, or even the entire city from her super-powered outbursts. Early on it's stated that Hina cannot bottle up her powers, she needs to use them every now and then or she will basically explode and destroy everything around her. Somewhat of a cliche \"rule\", but understandable. However, as the anime continues, it's almost as if the writers forgot about the powers completely, including this rule that they need to be used, and the super powered girls end up almost never using their powers at all during the rest of the show.\n\nThe show follows a few girls, who each got a handful of episodes mostly dedicated to them. The main character, Hina, is obnoxiously indifferent to others and has very tiring personal traits. She is taken care of by Nitta, a yakuza member who is actually a pretty stand-up, caring guy. His previously simple, enjoyable life living alone with no one else to really worry about is ruined when Hina shows up and becomes a constant thorn in his side. At first it was funny watching him deal with the constant problems she created for him. The show seemed to show that Hina was going to improve and grow as a person, no longer constantly being a problem for Nitta. Every now and then, the show would make it look like Hina finally realized how rude and annoying she was, and that she was going to have some character progression, yet she would return to her problematic self the very next episode.\n\nAnother one of the super-powered girls, Anzu, who had the second-most amount of screen time behind Hina, had such a weird story that It was almost awkward to watch. Without spoiling too much, she is basically homeless for most of the show and just lives with a bunch of old men in the woods who she grows very attached to, almost in a creepy way. I will however, say that the show did have some good character progression for Anzu throughout the show, but she seemed to almost be an irrelevant second story, mostly separate from everyone else. \n\nThe show also hopped to a third girl very often, this one without any superpowers (yet at this point the girls WITH superpowers almost never used them anyway). She's just a normal, teacher's pet type character, who gets dragged into working a bar at night, as well as some other increasingly weirder antics.\n\nOverall, the show ended up all over the place, telling multiple stories that had very few connections between them, all while completely ignoring one of the biggest bullet-points of the show, the super-powered girls from another world. Some of the few strengths the show had was some funny comedic moments, yet most of them based on such ridiculous things happening that you couldn't help but laugh. The main character Nitta was enjoyable, but you just feel bad for him the entire show because he has to deal with Hina constantly fucking shit up for him. I wouldn't say absolutely don't watch the show, you might get some more enjoyment out of it than me, but If you want a consistent story that doesn't contradict itself, look elsewhere. \n\n"}, {"id": 3627, "score": 50, "body": "Space\u00e2\u0098\u0086Dandy is a middle of the road anime. It tells the story of the daily lives of Dandy and his crew traveling through space searching for rare species of aliens for good money so they can go expend some time in BooBies, a intergalactic restaurant chain full of beautifully barmaids. Even with some incredible animation throughout it and an excellent soundtrack that accompanies the most memorable scenes couldn't make me love the show. But how Space\u00e2\u0098\u0086Dandy manage to fail at engaging me in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story and characters? \n\n First of let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take a look in the characters: The protagonist which is in the name of the anime is Dandy, he is the eccentric, pervert and lazy captain of Aloha Oe. He's also a bad alien hunter who wants to visit all the BooBies(an intergalactic restaurant chain full of beautifully waitresses) locations and dreams to buy the chain. On top of that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  overconfident and have little consideration for the lives of his friends. Dandy is basically that, he has little to no development throughout the course of the show. He doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change at all. His dream, passion and profession, besides supposedly have the key of the whole universe is all we know about him. Aside from that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only your good looking shallow action hero.The only time he does something that show us a bit more of his personality is in the only really good episode of all 13, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to that. Now let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take a look to the other members of the crew.\n\n QT is Dandy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outdated vacuum cleaner robot. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main purpose in the show is to clean the crew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trash, be the mechanic of the spaceship and make comic relief scenes. It doesn't help much in the field because it isn't made to fight so it spends the majority of the time taking care of the ship when the place they land is dangerous, communicating with the others via the bracelet that Dandy and Meow have. Aside from the cute design and voice, QT also doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have much to offer in terms of development, it gets the entire last episode for that but have little effect with me because the episode is not that interesting and in the 12 episodes i couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care for the robot enough for me to like the ending of the season and be confident to say that QT changed as a character, even with facing its difficulties and losses in this episode. It also doesn't change in the end.\n\n And lastly we have Meow, my least favorite character of the trio. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Betelgeusian, the only alien of the crew. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s introduced right after the beginning of the first episode and is pervert and lazy as Dandy. He claims to have information about the rare aliens and join the crew. Meow stays with Dandy the majority of the time outside of the spaceship but he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t add much to the series. Like QT, he serves as comic relief and not much aside from this.His backstory episode develops his character a bit more than QT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last episode but even with that i can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care about him. He just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do enough, he kind of is just there to have another character in the show.\n\n Before continuing to the next part i will quickly speak about some minor aspects of the anime. \n\n I believe that the Aloha Oe deserves a fast mention in this review because it's hawaiian decoration is memorable and unique, besides the spaceship with its colorful and inviting design, helps with Dandy's characterization, and his room exemplifies even more so. \n\n Also, something that bother me in the course of the series is the insertion of a narrator. Apart from a joke or another and the breaking of the fourth wall that happens a few times this is just bullshit and adds nothing to enhance the series.\n\n Lastly, speaking of breaks of the fourth wall, in one episode or another of the series, the narrator and characters make jokes about the situation the crew is in the moment using this feature. It's a small detail and show up very little but it's an interesting detail nonetheless.   \n\n So with all that out of the way we can talk about the plot. Well, there is no plot. This is a episodic series and the closest the series get to introduce a plot is with the horrible \u00e2\u0080\u009cvillains\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the literal sense, Dr. Gel and admiral Perry in the first episode. They are members of the useless Gogol empire, one of the two great powers fighting for the control of the universe, aside from the cool spaceship designs the empire is a joke throughout the show. Admiral Perry sends Dr. Gel to chase Dandy because he states as I said before that Dandy have the key of the Universe. All the scenes that involve this guys are useless.They serve as another source of comic relief but none of your jokes are fun, nothing they do works and nothing they say is interesting or meaningful, they could be removed entirely from the show and nothing that matters would be affected. \n\n One more thing about this plot issue is that some of the episodes seem like they don't matter. For example, in the first episode something happens that would affect the anime permanently, but in the next one that fact is ignored. Same kind of thing happens in episode 4. Which brings me to question if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tension at all in the series. In an interview, director Watanabe Shinichiro said he wanted his team to be free to do whatever they wanted without being limited and using their imagination. I understand the intentions of the team but even if the anime is a more experimental project and do not take itself seriously, the boring and uninteresting episodes meant for me a failure of execution and damaged my enjoyment of the series.\n\n Now let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talk about some of the episodes. If you want to avoid as many SPOILERS as possible feel free to skip through the next paragraph. the best one is episode 5, where Dandy goes out alone to capture a rare alien, whose name is Ad\u00c3\u00a9lie, her species has the ability to transfer the minds of their target into dolls they carry with them. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fun little adventure episode in which we, together with Dandy know more about Ad\u00c3\u00a9lie, we see the progression of the friendship between the two while they have fun together and we discover the serious and kind side of Dandy. The other episode that is interesting is the ninth. This episode is a different experience from the rest of the show, the visuals and the music are interesting and the epilogue, the way it is directed, might get you to think for a moment, but not too much. Likewise episode 11 is visually interesting but tells another boring story. We have some fun episodes like episode 6, 10 and 12, the potentially emocional \u00e2\u0085\u0094 of episode 8 and episodes like the first one that delivers fantastic animation in the last scene and it's worth to see it just because of that but really that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about it. Space\u00e2\u0098\u0086Dandy is not particularly bad but it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t consistently good or fun eighter. \n\nSpace\u00e2\u0098\u0086Dandy is a middle of the road anime, it has some good moments but overall there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing special about this season. Although i look forward to see if the second season manages to deal with the problems of the first, expand the world because the setting is forgettable, and develop their characters.\n"}, {"id": 3629, "score": 67, "body": "~~~img400(https://i.imgur.com/ow5FdxW.png)~~~\n# ~~~__Spoiler-free review of season 1__~~~\n<n></n>\n# Review in brief:\n\nPingu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surprise anime reboot, while a resounding hit with pre-established fans of the European claymation series, is difficult to recommend to newcomers despite being fairly entertaining in its own right. Though this short series provides simple fun, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a definitive step down from the older claymation seasons. That said, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already a fan you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll probably like Pingu in the City just fine.\n\n# Review in full:\n\nThough this review is solely about Pingu in the City, it would be difficult to truly understand what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right or wrong about it without looking back to its source. Originating from Switzerland in 1990, Pingu gained international acclaim as a children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claymation series that made fantastic use of its medium to present zany yet touching short stories about the eponymous penguin. The international aspect was reinforced by how it told itself though expression rather than verbal dialogue, allowing characters to morph themselves to convey thoughts & emotion while having them speak \u00e2\u0080\u009cPenguinese\u00e2\u0080\u009d, a silly gibberish language that fit in perfectly with the typically light-hearted nature of the show. Japan was one of the many countries Pingu gained a following in, resulting in a CG anime reboot few saw coming but many became excited for.\n\nThis reboot is, in a word, alright. Many more descriptive words could be used, but they wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be completely honest. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unfitting in some ways, and yet it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely still Pingu. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little unspirited, yet specific aspects of it were certainly made with spirit. Lacking almost works, but in truth there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no less going on here than there was before. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a whole product for sure, but you could say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s missing just a couple screws that would have held the whole thing solid.\n\n<center>img(https://i.imgur.com/P9XtxOm.gif)\n_Pingu attempting to patch his anime in the most anime way he knows how._</center>\n\nIt starts with the production values. The use of CG does an average job of replicating the original claymation, though there is an initial effort to avoid the looser effects from the old show (they start making things a bit looser from the halfway point of the first season but it still isn't the same). At the same time a few odd bits of repeated animation & freeze frames are scattered about, and while giving Pingu transformation sequences was a cute touch it does wear its welcome. In essence, while it clearly looks like Pingu, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hold the same expressiveness the original did, which means the plot can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take advantage of the art style like it had before. At least the Penguinese functions the same and usually does its job well, even if it sounds somewhat different (I swear the chef penguin was made to sound the slightest bit French). There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little noteworthy music to speak of though.\n\nPingu moving to the city gives the show a new setting but it isn't tapped into all that much. The environment and set pieces are interacted with in ways befitting an explorative children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s show, but nothing about it has to do with being in a city. Most of the jobs & activities Pingu partakes in could have taken place at his old village. Sure, the show can go on without the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccity\u00e2\u0080\u009d aspect, but for what is essentially a look into a child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exploration of his new home it results in many missed opportunities, especially as Pingu isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t performing a new job every episode (in fact most of his jobs are recycled 2 times or more). The city itself also feels awfully generic in the end, though part of it is also how static it is from an artistic standpoint. If you put humans in this setting I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d almost think I was looking at Soviet Murmansk after 5 buckets of pastel paint were evenly distributed.\n\n<center>img500(https://i.imgur.com/8R83zN0.jpg) img500(https://i.imgur.com/FVIpTeo.jpg)\n_For comparison, even though I could only find a decent image of modern Murmansk._</center>\n\nThe humor is pretty much in the same vein as the older Pingu episodes but it's not quite as quirky as the original due to its much more formulaic nature (Pingu observes job, gets job, does job, has job-related conflict, creatively resolves conflict or the episode ends before then). The show still has its moments, especially the first few episodes with the chef penguin (probably because Pingu does the silliest things to him, albeit unintentionally). Some episodes don't follow this formula (such as the racing and babysitting episodes) and they are usually more enjoyable as they actually explore things that fit the characters and the concept of children exploring rather than some random job Pingu gets a sudden interest in (which, again, could have worked fine if he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t repeat jobs so often). It honestly isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough to give the show consistent charm. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost frustrating to watch this season despite its occasionally down-to-earth episodes when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s usually just one or two of the characters messing around with a job they were curious about for six minutes before the main joke happens and the credits roll. For the new viewer, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll likely find a couple episodes charming and simply see the rest as a standard kid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s show.\n\nFortunately the old characters that appear are themselves and the new ones fit in quite well. Pingu himself is a big part of what makes his show enjoyable; his impulsive & childish nature leads him into many crazy situations but he is also hardworking and well-meaning, so even if his approaches to problems are less-than orthodox he generally manages to solve them through genuine effort, even though he rarely takes an optimal path to it and it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always work out. His interactions with his little sister Pinga bring out both of Pingu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sides in a strong way, further reinforcing his immature yet admirable character. Robby the Seal is like a foil to Pingu, usually fooling around and just looking for a good time, but he has a good chemistry with Pingu and they always find a way to help each other in the end. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a shame his appearances are limited and are mostly just in the later episodes. Most of the other characters have a few defining traits, which considering the limited screen-time they receive is enough to serve their roles and occasionally bring interesting moments to the table on their own accord. A little more expressive movement would have gone a long way towards having a consistently memorable cast though, and while there are definitely stand-out characters, the cast as a whole isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t able to make the city come to life by themselves.\n\n<center>img500(https://i.imgur.com/iWqJ4A5.jpg)\n_Pingu bears the gift of occasionally good anime episodes, at least for this season._</center>\n<n></n>\n# Verdict:\n\nPingu is back, but this season just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite the same. At times it has a genuine charm to it but when the majority of episodes can be chalked up to \u00e2\u0080\u009cstandard fare\u00e2\u0080\u009d despite occasional quirks it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to take off the nostalgia goggles and be honest with what it is. I still found Pingu in the City enjoyable, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not consistently good like Pingu was for me in the past.\n\n# Side note:\n\n[The second season](https://anilist.co/anime/99995/Pingu-in-the-City-2/) addressed most of the points made in this review and is overall a much better showing.  I could recommend the entire Pingu in the City series on account of the second season alone.  The above review of the first season is untouched from before then though, and will remain as such because standalone all of its points still apply to its season.  [My review of the second season](https://anilist.co/review/4318) is also standalone, but in the context of it following this season of Pingu in the City versus this review following the claymation series."}, {"id": 3638, "score": 50, "body": "__I assume you watched the anime first and wanted to read the real ending of \"Video Girls AI\" SPOILERS AHEAD!__\n\n__1.

There will be some delving into spoilers for 0 too, so consider yourself warned.)\n\nI think we all remember the feelings that the original Steins;Gate made us feel. Wonder, heartache, desperation, confusion, amusement, and the list goes on. It's these feelings that make us hold it so dear to this very day. We remember our favorite scenes and the feelings that we felt when we first watched them and are rewarded with a sense of nostalgia. For me, one of my favorite scenes from Steins;Gate (up there with every Kurisu scene, but I digress) is at the very end, when he receives the video from his future self affirming to himself that Steins;Gate can, in fact, be reached. Obviously, this is the very moment that Steins;Gate 0 is concerned with, but therein lies one of the major issues with 0: It rather cheapens this moment when it actually comes about in the final episode by bogging down the rest of the show with seemingly pointless side content. \n\nRight off the bat, we're introduced to new friends, each of whom don't matter at all aside from Suzuha's mom, who's given at least a small spotlight in the form of two episodes or so. We're also introduced to Leskinen, who's genuinely an interesting character, but receives a criminally little amount of screen time, and Maho, who acts as discount Kurisu for Steins;Gate 0. Not to say that these character's are bad per se, just unnecessary. Why would we need more friends for the lab parties when we have criminally underdeveloped Ruka and Feyris? I understand that that is probably due to adaptation constrains from the original visual novel, but still, it's a shame to see such long established members of the cast get such poor development even after 47 episodes. Notice how I never even talk about Kagari, the Kurisu clone? Exactly. Pointless.\n\nI got a little out of order with that little character critique, so I'll get back on track now. Visually speaking, Steins;Gate 0 isn't going to blow your socks off or anything, it's more of the same in regards to looking like Steins;Gate, aesthetically. However, there were some excellently framed shots, these two being the first to come to mind:\n~~~img(https://i.imgur.com/XTMBoDu.png)~~~\n~~~img(https://i.imgur.com/t3Ny2zp.jpg)~~~\nShots like these just make me forget any wrong that Steins;Gate 0 did, in addition to its phenomenal soundtrack, which incidentally, is what I'm going to praise next. I don't know if I've ever said it in a review, but I've definitely said it when discussing anime to other people: Music is what separates good anime from the great anime. Fortunately for Steins;Gate and Steins;Gate 0, their soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal. From soundtrack songs like Amadeus and Messanger to the opening \"Fatima\" and first ending \"Last Game\", the musical choice never fails to amaze me for well it fits the scene and sets the mood. One other thing I want to praise before we move on is the way they use the ending in certain episodes, like in episode 13, where Okabe find the room Kagari was brainwashed in and Last Game begins playing as he realizes what's going on. Absolute perfection.\n\n__Favorite Character:__ ~~Kurisu Makise~~ ~~Amadeus~~ Rintarou Okabe\n~~~img(https://otakukart.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/maxresdefault-30.jpg)~~~\n\nI tried to sneak Kurisu into my photo choice for Okabe, but unfortunately, I couldn't find a good one from 0. Honestly, I would have gone with Kurisu or Amadeus if I didn't feel as if those answers were major cop-outs, since they only appear in a handful of episodes between the two of them. Honestly, even though Okabe wasn't as fun as he was in Steins;Gate, he was easily the best character in 0, watching him overcome his emotional and mental struggles was certainly a highlight of the show, especially when everyone around him was blatantly disregarding his trauma for most of the show, which was a little frustrating. Shout out to Daru as well, who really stepped up as a character in 0, really maturing as a character throughout the run time. \n\nMore to the meat of why Steins;Gate 0 was so up and down for me was simply because of how pointless _at least_ half of the show felt. I expected much of the setup to go somewhere with them making it seem like Leskinen and Kagari were going to be real problems that would have to be dealt with, only for them to be sort of sidelined for the actual story. It felt like such an occurrence happened at least two or three times too, which makes it all harder to forgive. It turns out Amadeus was literally made to be erased, Mayuri's cosplay friends meant nothing, Kagari and Leskinen are simply a small hurdle for Okabe, and as I mentioned before, Ruka and Feyris still exist. They bait us with so many story lines in the first half of 0, that it simply feels cheap when we find out the real story is essentially the 'Mayrui Route', oh, and this is how the backstory to reaching Steins;Gate works out. I feel like the point of 0 got lost somewhere in translation. Wasn't it supposed to be about the Okabe who sends the video to the past? Why is it that him sending the all important video to achieve Steins;Gate feels like an afterthought?\n\nI'm a little disappointed with the lack of focus in Steins;Gate 0. It gave us some cool moments, like the aforementioned episode 13 scene, but a lot of useless time too. Don't get me wrong, I will always appreciate more Steins;Gate, but Steins;Gate 0 just makes me appreciate how good the original was instead. I like how they tied some things into the original, like the D-Mail to keep Kurisu from entering the lab for a few minutes, those moments were cool, but there was a distinct lack of those. Usually, we criticize works for leaning too hard on their successful predecessor, but in Steins;Gate 0's case, it didn't lean hard enough on the original.\n\nAll of this isn't to say that Steins;Gate 0 is _terrible_, but when you decide to make a sequel to a universally praised show, it's going to be examined under a different, more critical light. For me, Steins;Gate 0 was acceptable, but did not in any way reach the potential that it had. There were moments that I thought that 0 had finally reached the excellence of its predecessor, but it never _quite_ did. Obviously, I'm glad that we got more time in the Steins;Gate world, even if I wasn't as big a fan this time around."}, {"id": 3647, "score": 60, "body": "ib: Instant Bullet is interesting to read if only for it's flaws. Brought to you by Aka Akasaka who penned [Kaguya-sama](https://anilist.co/manga/86635/Kaguyasama-wa-Kokurasetai-Tensaitachi-no-Renai-Zunousen/), ib has the feeling of an author who understands his characters but never reaches the heights of his aforementioned work.\n\nFrom the get-go, the characters are a little bit too, if you'll excuse me for saying this of a fantasy, extraordinary and the attempts to ground them come off as forced and clumsy. Granted, certain leeway is given in fiction, but the central conceit of the work does not aid in passing off bad character writing.\n\nThe premise is rather standard (gain a super power; save the world) but the take on it's characters is what sets it apart, or rather it tries to. The protagonist is a delinquent (whose design fails to sell him as one), orphaned and cast aside by classmates and society. He hates the world, wishes it to be gone and what not; a cynical young man with no hope for himself nor the world. Set up as deuteragonist and foil to our protagonist is Sera Himeura, an orphaned girl who sets off to be the hero of the instant bullets [1] whose initial impression is not all that it seems.\n\nWith these two at the forefront and aided by a supporting cast with the depth of a puddle (to be fair to Akasaka, it read as if he was going to develop the supporting cast in much later chapters had it run that long), the series quickly devolves into a fairly standard action fantasy of good v. evil and try as Akasaka might, the series hardly goes beyond that. Though it tried. Weaved throughout the manga are elements of something more, something auspicious, but it never delivers. ib touches on elements of loneliness, melancholy, suffering, etc. and at times it almost touches on existential themes but it only brushes upon them like a child brushes on crumbs.\n\nib feels inchoate; certain character motivations and their arcs are wrapped up in a few pages that give the feeling it was to be developed over several chapters, if not volumes more. Yet the shortness of the series doesn't excuse Akasaka's poor writing. It feels more to be the case that Akasaka didn't know how to proceed. Truly what does this series in is the lack of thematic focus. At times I found myself wondering what Akasaka was trying to accomplish. The disparate cast of angst ridden teens (and the odd adult) come off as pleadingly sympathetic even though their situations are truly disheartening (i.e. parental abandonment, loneliness, poverty, abuse, etc.). Akasaka certainly has the skill yet his lack of direction hampers him. He seems to forget the fiction is a sort of persuasive writing; he fails to make us sympathetic to the characters and thus fails to make us sympathetic to the series. In short, why do I care what happens to these characters? Akasaka struggles trying to elocute his main point and by the end, he ends up with something in between platitude and teenage angst fueled pseudo-philosophical ramblings. \n\nEven Akasaka's artwork is as awkward as his writing. The characters look stiff, the backgrounds are lacking, and action, while brutal in some moments, fails to hit home. Though to be fair, his art is still as stiff and lacking in Kaguya-sama but it is serviceable there.\n\nYet not all is bad. Case in point, the witch's arc is, I believe, the high point of the series. The witch who gathered the instant bullets at the beginning, is perhaps the best developed and most sympathetic [2] of the cast. A truly pitiable backstory gives her scenes a greater depth and make her awkward love all the more heartbreaking. Her arc is carefully built up, intertwining her actions with the grander narrative and gives the rest of the cast a developmental thrust (that is honestly wasted on them) so when she is no longer present, the manga is all the more poorer for it. It feels as if Akasaka was finally hitting his stride during this arc and showcases his talents at weaving character interactions that give you a glimpse of what he is capable of. Unfortunately, the following arcs are rushed through and chopped up; a clear sign of cancellation cemented by his afterword in the final volume.\n\nI can't help but feel torn about this series; Akasaka certainly knows to how to make interesting character interactions (as seen in other of his works) but none of his wit and charm is present here. The work is clumsy, all too serious, mawkish, and angst ridden to be enjoyable which is ironic considering I love Dostoevsky. Give it a read if you have time, pass if you do not. Akasaka has better works that are more enjoyable than ib.\n\n[1] The instant bullets are the characters in the series who have a specific ability.\n[2] By \"most sympathetic,\" I do not mean that her circumstances were the worst but that Akasaka has convinced me that she is deserving of my sympathy. In short, her arc and character had the best writing in the series."}, {"id": 3650, "score": 69, "body": "___Vampire Hunter D___ has always been a cult favorite of many Anime fans dating all the way back to what historians would call the \"dark days of Anime\". Back then, Anime had limited exposure to American audiences, aside from the occasional showing of children's cartoons often mangled and edited. But with the release of Katsuhiro Otomo's controversially violent but nonetheless brilliant ___Akira___, an interest in edgy, darkly animated, gritty features from the Land of the Rising Sun was ignited, and so it followed with several titles imported. This low-budget animated direct-to-video feature from 1985 was one of them. Based on a book by renowned Japanese Horror author Hideyuki Kikuchi sporting smoky-hazed illustrations by Yoshitaka Amano (who would later gain cult status for his work on the classic _Final Fantasy_ series and later, Neil Gaiman's \"The Sandman\"), ___Vampire Hunter D___  aimed to be an edgy thriller, a horror movie, and even a love story all rolled in one. That said, critics were not unanimously ecstatic. Reviews were mixed, with most criticisms centered on the somewhat stilted animation or sometimes inconsistent characters. To this day, ___Vampire Hunter D___ has its share of detractors. But it also has its share of devoted fans, many of who had grown up in the West with a dubbed version produced by the late Carl Macek and his company, Streamline Pictures.\n\nSet in a post-apocalyptic future where vampires and mutants have overrun a human world, ___Vampire Hunter D___ begins on a dark night with a deftly choreographed action scene. Here we see Doris Lang, a courageous werewolf hunter's daughter stalking her gardens in pursuit of a T-Rex like monster with sharp teeth and scarlet eyes. Chasing it into the forest on horseback, Doris finds herself face to face with an even more imposing threat -- a hulking, shadowy vampire known as Count Magnus Lee. Naturally, the bloodthirsty aristocrat takes a drink from our heroine's jugular vein. The following day, Doris encounters a lone figure on a cyborg horse -- a mysterious cloaked stranger called \"D.\" Desperately, she hires him. The rest of the movie involves D doing everything in his power to slay the evil count to save Doris from an eternal life as a walking undead. Meanwhile, Doris must protect her impulsive little brother, Dan, and fend off the advances of an unwelcome suitor, the arrogant mayor's son Greco. Matters are further complicated when D also has to deal with L'armica, Count Lee's jealous daughter, and the ambitious Rei Ginsei, a deadly noble wanna-be who will do anything to earn his master's favor. During all this, Doris falls madly in love with D -- but it turns out that her rescuer (surprise) is half-vampire himself. (This explains why his left hand has a creepy-looking face that can talk to its master or even suck up nasty creatures.)\n\nDespite its promise of multi-threads, ___Vampire Hunter D___ turns out to be a much more simplistic story in execution, even bordering on predictable. Somehow the viewer knows that the lead character is going to triumph in the end in spite of the obstacles he faces in his quest. More problematic to viewers expecting flashy visuals might be the animation. As mentioned, this is a low-budget animated feature, resulting with a cel count that borders on choppiness in places. As such, the dramatic style of Amano's character illustrations loses a lot in the transition to screen. Furthermore, the backgrounds, although dark and appropriately imaginative, lack detail at times. As such, the film can seem visually dated to many viewers. Likewise, the soundtrack shares similar qualities. Although the sound effects are appropriately haunting and scary, at times they do sound cheesy, particularly the synthesizer sound effects when Count Lee sends rays from his eyes. The musical score from TM Network's Tetsuya Komuro is fittingly epic and sometimes spooky, although it is obviously driven by synth instruments from the '80s.\n\nFaults aside, ___Vampire Hunter D___ still delivers some entertainment value for viewers willing to overlook such technical shortcomings. In spite of its aforementioned predictability (some might argue this movie was tailor-made for Western audiences), ___Vampire Hunter D___ delves into some complex issues: D's inner struggle to resist his own instincts when Doris makes sexual advances on him and his inability to express his true compassion to others results from some very understandable emotions. It is also intriguing to discover that the villainous Count Lee's actions are motivated mostly by the desire for sport rather than malice, although he still does exude evil in every scene. The action and fight sequences are also skillfully choreographed in the style of a samurai-slasher.\n\nIt's also important to note that this movie has its share of graphic violence--there are quite a bit of gory swordfights, resulting with stabbing, amputating, or slicing in half. There is also one particularly disgusting moment toward the end where a character's head explodes, exposing his insides. (A character's face is also briefly stabbed in the eye in the subsequent scene.) While all this may sound pretty extreme for squeamish viewers, the cheap production values actually make the violence less gruesome and more campy, making it easier to sit through than most bloodfests. (Even so, both Sentai's release and Streamline's version are guilty of censor in one instance; a climactic character's graphic death at the end is interspersed by a flashing red cut which feels out of place and jarring.) There are also a few very inoffensive nude scenes. This is a movie best appreciated by an adult audience; parents should think twice before considering showing this to children.\n\nPerhaps it's partially because of this graphic nature that ___Vampire Hunter D___ succeeded in crossover success from its native country of Japan to the West. Dubbed in 1992, Streamline Pictures' release has been a nostalgic favorite for old school Anime fans to this day. Having said that, critics and many fans of the time still staked it with scathing reviews. I at one time appreciated this older dub, but over the years I have grown less and less fond of it. I'm not sure what it was that turned me off from it over the years, but then I figured it out: it sounds dreadfully stiff and stilted. In all fairness, Michael McConnohie, Barbara Goodson, Jeff Winkless, Lara Cody, and Kirk Thornton are all fine voice actors. The problem is that they were saddled into a production that veered on pure cheese and a lot of choppy-sounding dialogue ranging from mundane to laughable. There were also instances when Macek did a bit of tampering with the music, extending Komuro's score longer than usual sometimes sounding out of place with the visuals. Most infamously, the opening scene in which Doris is confronted by the Count has a rather corny \"permit me to introduce\" myself monologue which not only diluted the mood, it gave a very laughable quality that sadly would be exacerbated by phony Transylvanian accents and even a groan worthy love confession ripped off from ___The Empire Strikes Back___ (DORIS: I love you. D: I know.) The sound quality was quite bad, too, although that may be on the fault of the equipment used at the time, so I wouldn't dock the dub against it. This same dub was retained on Urban Vision's DVD release, which likewise used Streamline's cut of the film (which aside from the aforementioned censor, was otherwise uncut), resulting in a lot of heavy over saturation and muddy images.\n\nNow, thirty years after its debut in 1985, Sentai Filmworks has brought this title back from the dead and given it a fresh new coat of paint\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 er, fresh blood. (Get it?) Remastered from the original film elements, this movie has never looked better. The colors literally spring to life off the screen and sequences compromised by an overuse of darkness are brighter. It really does feel like a totally new movie in and of itself. The only drawback of the transfer is the occasional sight of speckles on the print (mostly dust particles accumulated on the cel before the camera photographed it), but otherwise, the video quality is amazing with a capital \"A.\"\n\nIn what may be a controversial move to fans of the Streamline dub, Sentai Filmworks has opted not to include that version on its BD release, but instead provide a brand new version. This will likely be a point of contention, as a lot of Streamline titles which received new dubs (___Akira___, ___Castle in the Sky___, ___My Neighbor Totoro___, \"Nadia--The Secret of Blue Water\", ___The Castle of Cagliostro___, \"Getter Robo\", \"3x3 Eyes\") have often been harshly maligned by old school fans, even though some might argue in the cases of some of those films, these newer versions were sorely needed, as a lot of these older dubs hadn't aged well at all.\n\nI do have a couple of minor issues regarding Sentai's newer dub, but unlike the Streamline version, this revamp, headed by Matt Greenfield of ADV fame, does a very commendable job of bringing the movie closer to its more serious intent, stripping it of much of the unintentional humor. The script is a fresh new translation of the original Japanese and sounds much better written and more natural, giving a more \"adult\" vibe. As far as the voices are concerned, the weakest voice of the dub is the same character that I had similar issues with in the Streamline version: that of Dan, Doris' little brother. In all fairness, Shannon Emerick does bring a bit more spunk to the role, but her voice, like her older dub counterpart, still strikes me as unconvincing for a little boy (at least she's not as distractingly feminine, though, thank goodness!). Otherwise, the rest of the cast is appropriate and well-fitting for the most part. I will always prefer Andrew Philpot and Mike McShane as D and his chatty left hand from Yoshiaki Kawajiri's later semi-sequel ___Vampire Hunter D:  Bloodlust___; however, John Gremillion's performance as the title character is still a big improvement over that of McConnohie from the original, sounding far less cheesy and more natural throughout. As D's left hand, Andy McAvin, who also plays Rei Ginsei, is also thankfully less nasally than his Streamline counterpart, and even gets the best line: \"This guy is such a HAND-ful.\" Luci Christian also sounds much more convincing and puts a lot more emotion into her role as Doris, making her a sympathetic character and her dialogue is thankfully free of any Kate Capshaw-isms. However, it's David Wald who really steals the show; as Count Magnus Lee, Wald has a smooth, regal-sounding baritone who sounds somewhat similar to Keith David. He's also very charismatic and dripping with pure evil; a _huge_ improvement over Jeff Winkless' laughably stilted turn in the Streamline dub (the fake sound vocal effects not even helping). Surprisingly, both he and his daughter, L'armica (Brittany Karbowski) are both given upper-class accents as opposed to the Transylvanian ones in the older one; frankly, though, I think it's all the better for it. It's a bit of a surprise that the people of Doris' village, including Greco, are given Southern accents until one remembers that this is supposed to be a \"Western\" vampire. It takes some getting used to, particularly in the case of Jay Hickman's drawling Greco, but having said that the actor does provide a bit of a slightly humorous touch to the role, giving him more character than Steve Bulen's too wispy-sounding and not forceful enough turn. The sound mix also sounds really good; not only are the voices better recorded, the music and sound effects also much more crisper than the Streamline version -- even mixed to 5.1, on the DVD it still sounded very muddy. As mentioned, Streamline's dub was not well received by the Anime community; time will tell if Sentai's newer dub gets better recognition (although Streamline loyalists will find it jarring either way), but as far as I'm concerned, this is a huge improvement over the original. (And yes, purists, the Japanese version IS still on the Blu Ray, complete with subtitles -- and for the first time, the ending song \"Your Song\" is translated!)\n\nThe only slight negative about Sentai's otherwise stunning BluRay is that there aren't enough extras. Urban Vision's DVD has the upper hand when it comes to that; aside from the Japanese trailer (the only thing from that release which is still retained here), there was also a \"making of\" featurette featuring director Toyoo Ashida and members of the original Japanese cast recording their roles. That is sorely missed, as is a video game preview and a gallery from Amano. If you still have your Urban Vision DVDs, you might wanna hold onto them just for that.\n\nOn the whole, though, Sentai deserves a shootout for their reworking of this fan favorite. Not only does it look amazing, it sounds better than ever. More importantly, it gives what some might consider a lesser animated feature new life. I still maintain that Kawajiri's ___Vampire Hunter D:  Bloodlust___ is the superior version of this tale -- much more complex and ambiguous -- but having said that I recommend this newer edition of the original. It truly prowls the night."}, {"id": 3652, "score": 50, "body": "[Usamaru Furuya](https://anilist.co/staff/96919/Usamaru-Furuya) is probably one of my favorite mangakas.\n \n#___LYCHEE LIGHT CLUB IS NOT FOR THE LIGHT HEARTED.___ IF YOU ARE NOT LOOKING FOR SOMETHING FULL OF HORRIFIC VIOLENCE AND DISGUSTING SHIT AND... well... on top of _everything else_, this is also technically a yaoi so... though, probably a fucking very strange one.#\n \nYeah. Let's just hop into this one...\n \n~~~img500(https://i.imgur.com/0KnNrDl.png)~~~\n \n___\n \n#Introduction#\n \nI've reviewed a Usamaru Furuya manga before (the [one about the Children's Crusade](https://anilist.co/manga/47020/Innocents-Shounen-Juujigun/)), but Lychee Light Club was the first of his manga I ever read and is probably the one he's most commonly known for. And probably for good reason, if you take a look at this fucking thing's description:\n \n> For the sooty industrial town's lads there's only one point of light: the Light Club, a secret brotherhood they've organized in an abandoned factory. They're on the verge of booting up their crowning achievement, a \"thinking machine\" fueled by lychee fruits. At the same time, the middle schoolers' cooties-fearing solidarity is devolving into a downright National Socialist muck of murderous paranoia, perverse aestheticism, and (not always) suppressed homosexuality.\n \nI had to read it after that. Okay so it's like... a club of youths that have formed a national socialist club and are constructing a robot that runs on fruit... and... what is the purpose of that robot you may ask?\n \nWell. To kidnap girls, of course.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/h1pcmpu.png)\n \n___\n \n#Probably One of the More Fucked Up Manga I've Ever Read#\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/8Z5vuA9.png)\n \n_Oh yeah, a super important note before we get too much farther into it, but if you decide to read this, definitely read the [prequel manga](https://anilist.co/manga/53805/Bokura-noHikari-Club/) Furuya did following this one after you're done with the original. It genuinely not only answers a lot of questions but also improved my opinion of the original._\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/cSRFiJT.png)\n \nFor this review, I'm going to restrain myself a bit more from posting any spoilers but... like from the very first chapter it is just complete and utter insanity. The Light Club has already been established at this point and the way we're introduced to the members of the club is that the leader asks what they should do with a guy who has seen their hideout.\n \nAnd several of their answers are... disturbing, to say the least. It immediately clues you in onto the sort of manga that you've begun reading.\n \n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/hZTF5Gf.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/tOoY6Q3.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/bdueUF0.png)~~~\n \nThen later, the first chapter of course ends with them literally collectively ripping the clothes off of their female world history teacher who also happened to see their little hideout and then you know, one of them _just disembowels her with a knife._\n \nThese are middle schoolers. These are middle schoolers. __These are middle schoolers.__\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/0rmVYpX.png)\n \n...I mean this is just the first chapter. And at the time of these events, they haven't even finished the girl kidnapping robot that one of the members of the club voluntarily donated one of his eyes for.\n \n\"Yeah fuck it. Supreme leader Zera, you can totally take out one of my eyes and hook it to this robot we have absolutely no fucking idea if it'll even work or not.\"\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/eZIdeyN.png)\n \n...Honestly, I just fully reread the original after beginning this review and there's actually a hell of a lot I ended up forgetting. I already kind of thought of it as this, but now I just want to underline it. __This is definitely one of the most graphic and fucked up manga I've ever read.__ Like I honestly kind of can't believe I forgot any of this. Chapter one actually is like just a fucking appetizer.\n \n>\"Disembowelment??? An appetizer!\"\n~TGG 2018\n \nOne of the biggest reasons probably why I've held off so long reviewing this is... I have no fucking clue who in this world I would actually recommend this to. Like jesus christ. Even if you're like me and you actively search for fucking horribly disgusting and gory things to read/watch, this is pretty... yeah.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/QDt0Xt1.png)\n \n___\n \n#Conclusion#\n \nAt the end of the day, I would probably call this manga _deeply fascinating_. Especially when you add the prequel into the mix because that was just straight up Usamaru Furuya returning to this manga and... refining it, I suppose.\n \nLike there's the fucking sick gore which gets so extreme that it could maybe be enough on its own, you have the yaoi angle which is a whole thing, but then you have the Lychee Light Club itself which is this one kid who essentially views himself to be superior to all that is absolutely paranoid that someone is going to betray him, and then all of his underlings who were just fellow teenagers who he lead or pushed into basically becoming psychopaths.\n \nThen pushed on top of all of that, you have the robot who has this like Frankenstein's monster thing going on where it wants to be human but it keeps getting commanded to do these horrible fucking things...\n \n...Again, it's a deeply fascinating series.\n \nIt's sick, it's gross, it's violent, it's weird, it's... it's 100% Usamaru Furuya actually. I ended up basically deciding I would read every single thing of his that he's made and every single one of them I've read so far after Lychee has been... if not a gory and soul crushing nightmare like the Children's Crusade manga , then just completely weird as shit.\n \nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/oiNnSlB.png)\n \nBecause of some of the content which pushes the envelope maybe a bit too far even for me, I give the original Lychee Light Club manga a __50 out of 100.__ _For the record, I give the prequel a 60 out of 100, but they genuinely should be read together with the prequel after the original._\n \nDespite the lowish score, I definitely don't regret reading Lychee Light Club and would recommend others to read it if... if you can stomach it, that is. This is definitely a \"feel bad\" manga.\n \nAnd by \"feel bad\", I of course mean feel fucking _DISGUSTED._\n \n~!Also it genuinely does work really well as \"okay here's a group, now let's watch as paranoia and betrayal just fucking tears it the FUCK apart\" thing. But the over the top violence and sexual stuff is... way more fucking pronounced to say the VERY LEAST.!~\n \n~~~img500(https://i.imgur.com/QUecMrX.png)~~~\n"}, {"id": 3661, "score": 50, "body": "_[Previously!](https://anilist.co/review/2301)_\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/EipcjYZ.png)\n\nI can't believe this. \n\nI actually cannot believe this. \n\nYami Shibai 5 ended with a goddamned story about a woman turning into a giant praying mantis monster and eating a guy. Then the mask guy literally walks off into the sunset.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/IccaVlj.png)\n\nI figured there would still be a sixth season because _why wouldn't_ ICLA keep going, but I truly thought after some of the episodes in 5, it was just fully set to just keep on going downhill.\n\nBut no. Yami Shibai 6 actually turned out to be decent. Hell, some of the episodes are actually genuinely creepy. When I watched the first episode, the opening being like the mask materializing from darkness immediately stuck in my mind.\n\nAnd it turned out there was an actual reason for it.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/XYMd2V1.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/BBnVOLi.png)~~~\n\n___\n\n#The \"Dark\" Yami Shibai\n\nI don't really know what happened at ICLA. ~~I [never](https://anilist.co/review/2244) [do](https://anilist.co/review/2387).~~ But there's plenty of art that looks similar to the stuff that was in 5 and Sekai no Yami Zukan. Yet the tone of this season's episodes are just so completely fucking different that it honestly mostly feels like it was made by someone else entirely.\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/pUlTYNE.png)\n\nIn addition, there's actual movement through all of the episodes! They actually didn't do the thing where an entire chunk of an episode is just obviously like one single drawing! Amazing!\n\nDon't get me wrong, there's still some of the good old Yami Shibai goofiness and/or a jumpscare ending or two, but I really cannot describe this season as anything else but a pleasant surprise. You know, even excluding the typical insanity that did make it into the season.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/aijP0J1.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/1E972Mx.png)~~~\n\nI really can't stress how terrible 5 was enough. It genuinely felt like they were just 100% out of ideas or were just tired of making Yami Shibai. But lo and behold! There's actual energy in this seasons! It feels like, god forbid, that they're actually TRYING again.\n\n...Or maybe not that they're trying again, but they really seemed to right a ship that seemed like it was sailing full speed towards an iceberg. Like rather than fully focusing on jumpscares and the schlock I've come to expect from Yami Shibai, there are actually several episodes that are more about people who have lost loved ones, or more psychological stuff.\n\nLike the very first episode clearly appears at first to be yet another spooky woman ghost episode, but the entire thing of the episode isn't that a spooky woman shows up and does a spooky scary jumpscare. It's that the father murdered the mother and she's coming back to \"surprise\" him.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/84WRQmD.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/PpdXe7B.png)~~~\n\nThen, in another episode there's like a swamp people throw precious possessions into as like an offering of sorts to appease an entity called \"the Muddy\" and I was just so fully prepared for a mud monster to emerge. \n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/Dh26U9P.png)\n\nBut nope! Instead, it's _VERY_ strongly implied that the wife just dragged her mother-in-law off and threw her into the swamp for throwing her ring from her biological mother into the swamp.\n\nWhat about the fun filled episode where a hospital patient is hearing voices from the room next to him, and it turns out to be the voices of people who hung themselves from the cherry tree outside?\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/PRbikQA.png) \n\nOr the episode where a mother dies on her way to pick up her daughter from daycare but dies in an accident and then the daughter also somehow dies? No... no ghosts huh? Just a dead mother and daughter. That's...\n\nimg440(https://i.imgur.com/CZsIOhQ.png)\n\nOh yeah, what about the mountain hiker who genuinely does hear the voice of a ghost trying to get him to come outside of the cabin into a horrible storm, but the ghost is claiming to be his dead son who died before he could get to climb the mountain with his father? And then the father is just about to give in to his grief and meet the ghost outside, but stops and doesn't go through with his suicide at the very last second, because he doesn't want to leave his wife alone.\n\n~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/NpapggO.png)~~~ ~~~img440(https://i.imgur.com/B5TaLh4.png)~~~\n\n...They should have stopped trying to scare us years ago!

While the anime is a little bit of it, although there are also some people who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really like it, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPrison School\u00e2\u0080\u009d is as infinity and beyond. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beyond its genre, one of the genres and the most favored by the community, especially the majority of men. The genre itself doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to hold back when they wanna show it but the anime shows it without anything holding it back and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I like about the anime although it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not one of my types and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m doing that because of research; there is no other intention. Initially, I was surprised by how many responses to the manga were hated by fans and one of the main factors of why it could happen is because of the unexpected and worst plot-twist ending ever. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pointless and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meaningless about it. Besides, the manga is pretty good after the anime while the rest of it, what I disappointed from this manga is that the author is trying so hard to do the jokes, have a meaningless character development, although the first is kinda promising and as I say, because of the ending. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPrison School\u00e2\u0080\u009d is no longer one of the same as the philosophy of boobs and ass but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more into the philosophy of how to be a freedom when someone has pissed you right in front of your face; that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what many people feel about after finished this piece.\n\nWhile I read it after the anime, after the group of perverted boys managed to get out of prison, Mari Kurihara and friends sent into the prison through the new student council led by Kate Takenomiya whose schoolmate of Mari. The first act of the story, as the anime is shown, is one of the best because of the build-up and the humor. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s combined with anything to do with what ecchi really is. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s combined something like adult thing but connects it with a very smart concept that it seems so funny yet fantastic. Therefore, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not one of the manga you can read in public or for certain people. While the second act of the story, it seems like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s poorly writing. At first, it was promising because we learned a lot about how Meiko and Mari Kurihara had been in the past. In addition, we learn a lot about Hana Midorikawa, her deepest feelings for Kiyoshi and the past they have lived with Mari. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interesting but there is a little difference.\n\nThe story went downhill constantly with its own humor. Besides, there is a quite nice relationship between Kiyoshi and Mari which I thought that it would be a good sub-plot for the next chapters. But, I expected too much. Kiyoshi with his characteristics and personalities that beyond the limits becomes the major background and it comes from nowhere. The story didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bring what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the unique part between those. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have anything to do with the plot that seems repulsive over and over again and other characters seem to be pushed aside from Kiyoshi. Instead, some kind of unexpected humor turns out there are still ridiculous like the gay misunderstanding relationships between Takehito and Jouji which I think is funny and hilarious. Shingo seems no longer something like the first act because I like this character of how the author made it as a trigger and a messed up character to further grown the conflicts. Besides, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing to do with him. Reiji is a strange character and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really find out what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most important to deal with the story in addition to the sub-plot. Moreover, there is kind of sweet yet weird relationship between Risa and Reiji and I think that Risa is a little cute heroine in this manga because its development but we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really care what makes it important. At least, it makes both of them get a happy ending.\n\nTakehito was a serious one because he is a character who has an important role besides Kiyoshi along with Mari and her friends. In the end, there is a friendship from a group of people who initially enemies become friends; and finally become an \u00e2\u0080\u009cenemy\u00e2\u0080\u009d again. There is a sub-plot from Takehito as well which sometimes cover several plot holes and unfunny moments but sometimes they are the opposite. There is a side story from Mari\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dad which only acts as a filler from a story that has nothing to do with it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brought in an absurd and strange way but it only fills with a part of the chapter. Some kind of unexplained thing like why all the boys get together doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean anything whatsoever and that also doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to give any obvious reason of a rocket plastic or something like that they consider as God but not. It seems the humor is really trying so hard to be as humor itself besides Reiji as the character that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really understand. Hana, at first, I think would be a type of bad guy turns good character. However, the author seems to do that; for certain reasons. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really understand about this heroine which the relationship between Kiyoshi is actually good enough to improve many more sub-plots besides Kiyoshi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deepest feelings. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone because we never know a real reason she has on Kiyoshi. Does she love Kiyoshi so she feels jealous of Kiyoshi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feelings? Is she jealous of Chiyo that Kiyoshi doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deserve? Does she hate men? You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re stuck in such a philosophy about a mind game but you never know the answer because the author is like you have to use your imagination, interpretation, or high IQ to understand this character.\n\nMeiko is a character with its own story and I started to care about this character because of her psychology and background. But, it messed up with other main characters how this character was mocked. There is an exaggerated moment about her, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just become awkward and ridiculous. It didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really stick with the main plot and it felt like, we also started to forget this character as well. There are also changes from Mari\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character which I think will be even better when this character also becomes the major but it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem. There is anything that explains why this character immediately turned away, why did she leave everything without any reason, why, why, and why. In the end, Kate is a good person in this manga. And I wanna say one more time: the ending sucks so much. Forgetting everything from the beginning from the end or building it from scratch to destroy it until the end doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a plot-twist. If you want to make a plot twist, at least you shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ridicule your readers so they would love your works which become meaningful.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPrison School\u00e2\u0080\u009d seems to end with a steep derivative. At the onset, it was deliberately so slow because of the over-textualized but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a suicide roller coaster you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ride. The art is excellent but there is no transition between the main plot with the side plot. The artwork style is so detailed and there is no blur thing or something like that. I mean, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a guy who wants to find some research too. The first act of the story is unique, hilarious, and there are main points of it while the second act of the story seems to be just impressed at the beginning but it meaningless at the end. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not one of those people who will take this manga seriously but there are some people who say that the ending is worse than Jun Maeda\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cCharlotte\u00e2\u0080\u009d which I started to think like that. Besides how this manga seemed has an interesting concept at the beginning, I had to be able to hold it back how this manga fairly made me a little angry and annoyed. Aside from, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBunny Drop\u00e2\u0080\u009d isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t one of them."}, {"id": 3667, "score": 50, "body": "\n\nKimi no Suizou wo Tabetai, also known by the English title \"I want to eat your pancreas\", is a drama anime film with tragedy. It is about an outgoing girl who has a pancreatic illness which she has not told anyone except her family that she has this illness. A boy from her class stumbles upon her diary that she left in the hospital and she comes back to fetch the diary only to realise that he read it so she ends up telling him about her illness. Due to this secret knowledge of theirs that none of their classmates know about, they start to grow closer. Sakura Yamauchi, the girl with the pancreatic illness, notices that the boy is a bookworm and does not talk with anyone and does not have any friends so she feels she has some sort of duty to become friends with him and change him for the better. This all sounds good on paper, but it falls short due to the way this film was structured along with other things that this review will touch on. Some scenes felt out of place and did not add much too the film's main story.\n\nThe animation of this film was quite disappointing. It seems that this anime film didn't have much of a budget and a lot of the animation was quite lazy. This film was very much heavy in dialogue to make up for the still shots of animation that had a pan effect on the cinematography showing several still animated shots in one after another that conveyed the character's activities rather than animating their movements. This made the movie tell the story verbally rather than showing it to us and it felt very lazy. Due to this sequence of several still shots throughout the film, it felt very rushed in terms of pacing as it was evident they were trying to squeeze as much as they could into this film.\n\nThe soundtrack was not memorable and the opening theme was just shoved into the film in a distracting and \"pushy\" way. The voice actors did a good job though. No real complaints in that department.\n\nCharacter development was okay. It could have been a lot better. I liked how they symbolised the unwillingness of opening up doors for friendship with the rejection of taking gum when offered by a classmate. I thought that added a nice little metaphorical touch to the anime film. Where this film lacks though is the reasoning with the actions of the cast in this film. I could not get fully emotionally invested in the relationship between the two main characters as their attitudes and emotions seemed to have a convenient \"light switch\" wherever it was convenient for the plot to do so. Yamauchi's best friend was a character in this film which was included just to add unnecessary drama to this anime film which could have been a bittersweet tale with more character development on the main characters' relationship but it decided to be more of a rivalry with attention and dictatorship of who Yamauchi should be friends with or the reasons as to why the other characters do not open up to the introverted boy.\n\nI still found some enjoyment watching it as there were sweet moments that occurred in this anime film. It's just a shame that it was tainted by the poorly written aspects of this anime film.\n\nI found this anime to be similar to another anime called Your Lie in April, particularly with the motivations, actions and relationships that are conveyed in both anime. I would suggest watching Your Lie in April instead of this if you have the patience of watching an anime series rather than a film. I cannot recommend this anime unless you find deep enjoyment watching growing friendships within characters that is interlaced with tragedy.\n\nIf you do end up watching this anime film, stay to the end of the film as there is a post-credit scene which does make the film a little bit better and adds a better conclusion to the ending before the credits roll."}, {"id": 3670, "score": 50, "body": "Gabriel DropOut\n-subbed\n\nStory:\nGabriel DropOut is the about the daily life of a lazy angel,  a friendly demon, a sadistic angel, and a megalomaniacal/incompetent demon going to high school in Japan.  Honestly it's not that original as far as character personalities and activities go.  That's not to say it isn't entertaining, just that it's nothing I haven't seen before with minor variations.  The real standout episodes are 9 and 10 where they actually use the premise for something original, the Christmas party and the scenes in Heaven & Hell being pretty entertaining and making me wish more time was spent in those locations.  I do like the idea that Heaven is super boring compared to Earth, due to its excessive wholesomeness.  One thing the show gets right on numerous occasions are visual gags that it doesn't draw much attention to which makes them hilarious.  Anyway, there isn't really much else to say, so I'll move onto characters.\n\nCharacters:\n\nGabriel-\nThe show's titular character, she's the star student at her school in heaven, but quickly devolves into a messy and lazy shut in obsessed with MMOs once she starts living on Earth.  Her deadpan attitude is pretty entertaining she's kinda like a combination of Tomoko (Watamote) and Umaru (Himouto Umaru-Chan).  As an aside I really appreciate the lack of upskirt shots despite her wearing a red jacket with no pants a lot of the time, it shows that her design was done for character purposes and not fan service.\n\nVignette-\nA character named Vignette in a show focused on comedic vignettes, hmmmm. . .  Anyway Vigne as she's most often called is Gabriel's best friend and a demon who acts like an angel to directly contrast Gabriel.  She's a pretty likeable character, although I question how she made it to high school when she constantly fails to act like a demon.  She's probably my favorite of the cast.\n\nSatania-\nA, stupid, megalomaniacal, wannabe archdemon whose repetitive gags get so old that you want to slam your head against the wall repeatedly by the end of the 3rd episode.  She's obnoxious, which she's supposed to be, but it's also supposed to be funny which to be fair she does have a number of good scenes, but the running gag with her shouting out her name and the dog stealing her bread get really really old.\n\nRaphiel-\nA sadist who puts on the air of being a role model of an angel.  She constantly laughs at others misfortunes.  Also boobs.\n\nThere's a couple side characters as well, but for the sake of brevity and not boring you I'll leave it there.\n\nAnimation:\nI'm going to start out talking about something I've never really discussed before and that's character design.  I immediately noticed that Gabriel and Vignette looked a lot like Umaru and Ebina (Himouto Umaru-Chan) respectively and Satanica was pretty reminiscent of Riko (Love Lab) well a quick check of MAL showed that this was done by the same animation studio, Doga Kobo.  So what's my point?  Well it's just kinda distracting, not enough for me to detract points from the final score, just distracting.  I wrote that when I first started watching, for most of the show Gabriel looks damn near identical to Taiga from ToraDora which ,again, is distracting but certainly not worth docking a point.  \nThe animation just generally looks like a Doga Kobo show, jumpy, comedic animation.  It's colorful and lends itself decently well to comedy, but certainly isn't on par with Kyoani, which yes, I do have a massive hard on for them.\n\nMusic:\nThe OP is decently, and the chorus is relatively catchy, but nothing too special.  The ED is downright forgettable.  The music in the show is nothing to write home about either.\n\nOverall:\nI may have come across like I didn't like this show very much, and while I certainly don't love it, it's still a decent show that held my attention and made me laugh a few times.  Now mileage always varies on humor and some people may absolutely love this show, but I'm not one of them.\n\n5/10\n"}, {"id": 3677, "score": 60, "body": "So, I watched 74 episodes so far, I was realizing more and more how it kinda irritates me for certain reasons.\n\nBoruto annoys me and not because of what happened in the beginning when he didn't respect or understood his dad, Naruto; I understood the reasons for that. I think it's how how they are developing his character. He's cocky and unruly (I know that's a bit harsh to say but that's how I feel right now). The reason for this is he doesn't think of this consequences of his actions like time of the chunin exams when he used the ninja tools fully aware that he was cheating, getting into his situations that could get him killed but that plot armor protecting him and the recent one when he tries to find Mitsuki fully aware that the Hokage (Naruto) issued an order that anyone who leaves the village is going to classified as a rogue ninja. When Naruto was chasing Sasuke he at least had permission to do so as a mission to bring him back. Boruto doesn't get punished at all from these decisions even though he should have been.\n\nNostalgia is another one. Because its essentially a sequel of NARUTO, I can't help but compare it. I keep wanting to see more the old characters again and see them getting some action. While its a peaceful time, I don't think Boruto and the rest of the new generation are going to be stronger than the old ones because the harsh training they used to have. You have to had noticed that the chunin exams were a joke compared to the previous ones. Genins risk their lives in those exams and this one didn't have an epic tournament arc at all.since the only one who seemed to be close to the strength from back then was Gaara's son. They tried to do similar things that happened in Naruto at the end too. And the major upset was how they tried to fit Boruto in the fight with Momoshiki, who wasn't even as strong as Kaguya. Sasuke probably noticed Boruto's special ability to teleport the rasengan but that wasn't the reason he brought bring him to the fight. Think about it, why would you bring a 'genin' to fight a powerful foe like that and they purposely lessen Naruto's power at the time so they could find a way to give Boruto recognition. Not trying to say it was a bad idea but if Sasuke had said he had planned on Boruto's ability to defeat the enemy then it was going to be a great strategy and reason to bring him but he didn't.\n\nThere's a bit more but those are the two main reasons. Its hard to not compare Naruto to Boruto and It feels like I'm trying to find the same sensation of Naruto from Boruto which lessens my enjoyment even though I try not to. So, I decided to stop watching for the time being or until he becomes a teen when the story furthers on and things changed.\n"}, {"id": 3706, "score": 55, "body": "__~~~Minor Spoilers~~~__\n___\nAn unorthodox approach to an anime can lead to mixed results. A lot of the people who watched Crybaby loved and praised it as the best show of the year, because it was so odd and different than the usual offering. Others downright hate it because of that same reason.\n\nWatching Crybaby was a tough task to be honest. I couldn't find myself being invested into the story. And what exactly was the story? There were bits and pieces of exposition thrown around, a lot of plot lines were being forgotten and being left aside to continue the overarching \"story\". The pacing is inconsistent and the story is overall a jumbled mess. There are drastic tonal shifts that come out of nowhere. I always feel like I'm left confused and disinterested the more and more I kept watching. They just slapped on a story.\n\nLuckily, the anime picks up in the latter half and delivers something more entertaining. Or... that's what I believed at first. I appreciate the allegorical references to the bible, the BGM was pure awesome, the animation was wonky but cool, and the action sequences were quite the sight. But... that was all there was to it. It kept my attention, but nothing beyond that. \n\nThe ending really hits the spot. Once I realised what it all meant, I still can't find appreciation for the moments that lead up to the severely rushed climax. A climax that's 10 minutes long, appearing right at the end, is not what I would prefer. \n\nAnd here's where I really felt disconnected from the show. The characters. Where's the development? Where's the journey? All I see is someone being the same person they were in the beginning, besides the whole transformation right in the first episode. Akira Fudou, Devilman himself, doesn't really change. And the antagonist? He goes through more of a phase, but I end up disliking him even more, and not in the \"good-written villain\" kind of way. I couldn't relate to him, I couldn't understand him. He was just... there. Throughout the series, we are introduced to characters that, sooner or later, will eventually die. Nothing was to be gained from being attached to them. Nothing special stood out.\n\nSo, maybe the anime is just story-driven? Except, there wasn't much of a cohesive plot.\n\nThat's the main problem. I didn't feel invested. And nothing really considered me otherwise. So many things out of place, so many pointless exposition, so many inconsistencies. \n\nOverall, I found _Devilman Crybaby_ to be mediocre. It wasn't horrible. I just think of it as being \"there\". The journey to finish it was a pain. Focuses a lot on the blood and sex, yet doesn't spend enough time giving it purpose. Even if I appreciated the audiovisual aspect, I still couldn't find myself invested and ended up being dissatisfied as a result.

Few series pack as many disparate elements into their runtime. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s condense it this way; an idol show in which the idol troupe our protagonists wish to join is also a paramilitary organization with its own planet that fights repressive governments and anti-music terrorists, with the benefit of mecha and all other sorts of advanced weaponry. Also, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a space opera. *AKB*, regardless of its actual quality, might just qualify as simply one of the conceptually silliest anime ever made. There is an almost gleeful commitment to piling ridiculous--sometimes outright stupid--concepts, and execution, on top of each other. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gaudy CGI, diehard otaku who fight with glowstick missiles, light sabers that spring from microphone grips--10 points if you correctly guessed that these are called \u00e2\u0080\u009cmic sabers\u00e2\u0080\u009d--combat and idol training taking place side by side and being treated as equivalently difficult, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not even mentioning the anti-art terrorist group DES, whose missiles are, as the camera reminds us every time they show up, hilariously stamped with a massive logo reading \u00e2\u0080\u009cNO IDOLS\u00e2\u0080\u009d and a struckthrough silhouette of a performer. That I somehow managed to get a whole paragraph in without mentioning the dynasty of idols that one member of the titular space idol troupe belongs to, or the shinto shrine inner sanctum hidden inside their starship, says a lot about how truly caution-to-the-wind *AKB0048* is. This is a show that genuinely, truly, through and through, does not care if you think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ridiculous.\n\nimg220(https://i.imgur.com/q8qRXku.jpg)\n\nYou can only get so far on sheer silliness, though, especially for something that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not actually a comedy anime (indeed, for being as funny as it sometimes is, *00* is surprisingly bereft of many actual *jokes*, and the ones that *do* get made tend to fall firmly in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cso bad they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re funny again\u00e2\u0080\u009d camp, if they land at all). No, *00* would be completely lost if not for the fact that the anime has a very, very big heart, and wears it on its sleeve. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a classic love it or hate it type thing, either you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a sap like yours truly and will find this immediately endearing, or you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re, well, not, and will find it incredibly grating. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a lot of wiggle room with *00*, and I suspect that that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the reason the franchise doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to have had much of a longtail despite the real-world star power backing it up. \n\nThe writing, meanwhile, has its ups and downs. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impressive all on its own that the large cast largely manages to stay distinctive. The show ostensibly \u00e2\u0080\u009ccenters on\u00e2\u0080\u009d the core trio we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re first introduced to, three young girls--Nagisa, Suzuno, and Yuuka--from a planet called Lancastar who (along with a fourth, Episode 2 inclusion Chieri) witness a 00 concert as young girls, and pursue their dreams to become idols within the troupe as proper \u00e2\u0080\u009csuccessors\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the current performers (something the show does establish as being complete with a full-on name change. Second-stringer Shiori is introduced to us as Minami Takahashi V). The truth is though that the cast balloons quickly, and some members get more screentime than others. Still, as said, they all manage to remain distinctive (sans perhaps Q-lister Megumi, whose main trait seems to be vague jealousy), which is impressive enough given the large size. Where this largely falters is when the show attempts to delve into a more serious / \u00e2\u0080\u009cdarker\u00e2\u0080\u009d side of the galactic idol biz. *Revue Starlight* this is not, and the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempts to handle these aspects are generally where it falls flat. \n\nReally if 00 has a major problem, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not always aware of its own best quality, which is being deliciously over-the-top. Too often, the series takes an unfortunate dip into either rote performance melodrama one could get in *any* idol series (there are enough \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy does she get this position / I wanted that position\u00e2\u0080\u009d scuffles in the series that listing them isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t meaningful) or in one particularly ill-conceived instance--the entirety of episode 10--hacky ecchi comedy. When 00 *is* aware of its own strengths though, conversely, it leads to moments that are genuinely affecting, such as the Lancastar Quartet meeting their first group of fans on an entertainment-banned world. Ultimately what sabotages 00 the most, when it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work, is its own nature as an idol series, and by necessity, as a promotional vehicle for the very real AKB48. 00 can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be as idealistic as it would need to be to truly measure up to its own world. The universe that *AKB0048* paints is one where pop groups genuinely have the power to save entire planets, but unfortunately, the kind of story that that calls for--a very focused, tightly-paced narrative that doubles down on its thematics first and foremost and is built around a strong central protagonist--is not what we get. 00 is too scattered for that. Instead, we have a flawed series with a big heart, one that understandably chooses to go out like it began--with the AKB0048 members, now including the Lancastar Quartet, kicking ass against DES while singing their hearts out, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moments like these when the series truly shines. \n\nimg220(https://i.imgur.com/BotoQSi.png)\n\nSadly, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re probably too few to make the series a truly easy recommendation. 00 is, premise-wise, certainly among the more out-there anime, but that kind of novelty wears off, and what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re left with is a show that shoots for the moon but misses. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s frustrating in a way, because maybe if 00 wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shackled to a real idol franchise it could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had more freedom to either subvert or double down on its theme of reaching for your dreams, and been truly great instead of merely decent, but, one reviews the show they watch, not the one they wish existed. Still, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in the mood for idols and mecha painted with the same CGI brush, and *Idolmaster Xenoglossia* just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sound up your alley, there are far worse ways to spend 6 \u00c2\u00bd hours than with *AKB0048*. Plus, hey, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRIVER\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a banger.\n"}, {"id": 3715, "score": 50, "body": "_Island_ represents for me one of the two death flags for anime, and if you start to notice them, you may be able to save yourself the time and energy I find myself wasting in pursuit of criticism. The first, not represented here, but I am sure I will get there eventually, is that the anime you are watching is based on a light novel. Generally, this is a sign that the plot is not going to be satisfying because it is designed to entice you into reading the LN. There are exceptions of course, but in the main, I find this is true.\n\nThe second is that the show you are watching is from the science-fiction genre (but not a mecha show). Enter _Island_.\n\nDisclosure: according to AniList, I watched Island over the course of four months, but I watched the last half or so probably within the last week and a half or so. A binge session may result in a different experience\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I doubt it though.\n\nIn as spoiler-free a summary as possible: a man (Setsuna) wakes up on beach with no memory of who he is other than his name and the name of the girl who finds him later (Rinne) and the fact that he needs to 1) save someone and 2) kill someone, and he believes he has come from the future. Pretty \u00e2\u0080\u009csimple\u00e2\u0080\u009d as far as typical anime contrived plots go, but then we must layer on the B-Z plots. Everyone has personal problems needed resolved, the titular island is wary of strangers (we hear this a lot, but only one person every raises any issues regarding this), Rinne has a mysterious past of her own, and there is a mysterious sickness that affects some of the town\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population. The series revolves around Setsuna dealing with the mysteries both within and without his control.\n\nFor the first \u00c2\u00be of the show, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m on board. It is exploring the (inter)personal relationships of our four main characters and has a surprisingly laid-bare romance that is refreshing in a normally cloistered medium. I had even forgotten it was a sci-fi show until\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the sci-fi jumped out and slapped me in the face.\n\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the thing about science fiction in anime, and perhaps in all media, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know: it is frequently too light on the science. I remember the same feeling in _Kiznaiver_ and _Dimension W_ (to name a few off the top of my head) where the story develops to a point and is interesting, but there comes a point where the writer or someone doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to make the science make sense\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. So they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Whatever needs to happen happens, usually in the waning few episodes and the story ends.\n\nI got on board with the romance, the setting, all of that, in _Island,_ but once the science entered the picture, with less than half the run to go, it proceeded to crap both the bed and itself. The change in tone and pace is abrupt. The series had been fairly slow, but it takes a violent left turn and never looks back. The result is a science-fiction anime that hand-waves past the science and a romance anime that jarringly shifts and refocuses in the closing minutes in such a way that leaves the viewer (or at least me) confused and rethinking all the decisions that preceded that moment. \n\nA thematically-unrelated shift could be seen a short while ago in the _How I Met Your Mother_ finale, if you watched that. I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spoil _HIMYM_ here, but if you are familiar, the jarring last act switcheroo is reminiscent here in ways that go well beyond the normal \u00e2\u0080\u009cbest girl loses\u00e2\u0080\u009d troupe of previous romances in anime.\n\nIn short, I suppose, _Island_ is an okay show. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look bad or sound bad, and 95% of the story is okay, but that last 5% is enough to spoil the whole affair. Maybe, just maybe, if the science had had more room to breathe, and there was less time spent on plots going no where (Karen getting married? Who cares. Soot Blight Syndrome? Not important. Why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they like outsiders? Who knows?), Island could have been good. Instead, it feels incredibly mismanaged and inconsistent.\n\nShould my sister watch this anime?

If an average person is put into a difficult situation, and makes poor choices, does that make them a bad person? Complicated ethical debate is part of the viewing experience. Many of the characters actions tend to fall into moral grey areas. Sorting out who is right and wrong, if their is a villain to cast the blame on, is a task left to the viewer.\n\nThe portrayal of both women and men in the series can be very frustrating. Character logic is sometimes tossed aside in order to create and further dramatic developments. While our main trio is always punished and suffers for their missteps, a few side characters seem to be invincible. The comic relief characters are too happy go lucky to fit in the series naturally, and a male side characters reprehensible actions seem to be forgotten, or accepted.\n\nThe series can be hard to follow at times. Episodes skip back and forth through several years of time without any major indicators. A high school uniform is pretty explanatory, but one year after high school, or three years after, who knows? The series predominant focus is three years after high school.\n\nThe animation varies between poor and minimal, but combined with the content of the show fits really well. It is a lowbrow soap opera, and it never tries to be anything else. The show is filled with a unique kind of fanservice, call it dramaservice. Fanservice in the traditional sense is almost nonexistent. There is nudity and sex scenes, but they are central to the plot and very non-erotic.\n\nThe most important part is that the drama is __JUICY__. That is what we are all here for right?

Animation. Characters. Plot. Sound/Music. Every gradable metric turns up a poor score, but the series has a hidden merit that will see it be a riveting experience for some viewers. Anime viewers often hold the belief that bad shows can only be enjoyed ironically. Kimi ga Nozomu Eien exists in defiance of this principle, and while you groan at the poor dialogue and shallow characters, you might accidentally be swept away by the hard hitting and well timed dramatic events.\n\nIn a word: dramaservice."}, {"id": 3735, "score": 60, "body": "Penguin Highway is an anime film about a boy who is mature for his age but still has some things to learn as a growing boy.

Not everyone who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the school where gambling is about to earn a lot of money or erase their status of slavery, Jabami do gambling because\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 he likes it. She sees gambling more than someone normally but gambling is her main food of Jabami itself. She is smart, able to understand her opponent, to become one of the people who shook the academy. She is unpredictable and so overpowered when it comes to gambling. But what makes her so unique \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from all the characters in this anime \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 gambling is her fetish. Every time she plays gambling, she always gives off an orgasm reaction when she hears the words gambling. From here, I found irregularities where I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really understand the character.\n\nJust like other overpowered characters, she isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t given too much background to us to be able to see her characteristics not just from one point of view, making us think of being female characters who orgasm when playing gambling. In addition to her vague background, each episode doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t allow her prowess to play gambling which it makes this anime seem so ambiguous. Why and what makes it like that? We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really see it as a character in general or you can say, almost all the characters in this anime are like that. Besides Jabami, all the characters in this anime are psychopathic-like characteristics. The second character we see besides Jabami is Mary Saotome. Just like Jabami, her madness makes her character seems predictable. However, the anime seems trying not to be impressed by showing all the psychopathic characters but we see from two specific points of view. In addition to giving an exaggeration of expressions of these characters, sometimes we see them as normal characters. A few seconds, everything changes both the character of your first impression looks normal but turns out it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a psychopathic thing like.\n\nHonestly, the first episode is exceptional because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite impressive and promising so I keep wondering who else will be defeated by Jabami. But, the farther it feels, the more predictable it is that it raises thousands of questions from one scene to another. Every gambling starts, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see how this anime is trying to explain the rule. We just forget in an instant because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just too dense to understand. Some scenes really make me able to see this anime a bit interesting because there is some twist but sometimes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just predictable especially the ending which I guess one of the most memorable things at the beginning but I just didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really see any interesting thing about it.\n\nThere aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t many normal characters in this anime except only Ryouta Suzui. In fact, his presence doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to be there to be able to make this anime even crazier than others. Aside from being a side character which I think he is main characters, he can be said as human beings in general. Indeed, the law of the pyramid where the strong will survive and the weak will be under while being a slave isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t something so complicated for Suzui besides always relying on Jabami alone regardless of his role at the end is quite important. The thing about this anime, again, besides doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really explain why Jabami can be overpowered is that almost all characters don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any background at all. Where do they get the money? Why can they go to school there? Is this only for rich people? We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really see it, but just look at it from one perspective, namely madness characteristics. Besides that, the system in this school I think is very ridiculous. Kirari Momobami as the leader of Student Council explains if this system changes the order of human\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life. Like, an aquarium that contains lots of small fish but can be defeated by just one big fish with one appetite. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how the system in this school works. Regardless of which, she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give a definite impression of why.\n\nThe enemy of my enemy is my friend. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I can get when I try to understand all the characters in this anime, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, nobody can be trusted. There is only a betrayal, and there are two-faced. There is one thing that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so promising to \u00e2\u0080\u009cstart\u00e2\u0080\u009d in this anime is the battle between Jabami and Ikishima. Ikishima might be the craziest character in this anime, crazier than Jabami, crazier than Momobami, crazier than all. She is violent, which means that pain is a worth-stake rather than money according to her. She sometimes imitating a Russian Roulette where she points a gun containing one or two bullets at her head and relies on luck. This is what I found unique in this scene between Jabami and Ikishima because life is at stake. Now, this is something I like besides the Russian Roulette from \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Deer Hunter\u00e2\u0080\u009d or any lethal game. Turns out, it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really fit with my expectations because it ruined with a goddamn ridiculous twist.\n\nThe art is impressive and excellent. It gives you some aesthetics with its own artistic value ranging from color selection, character design, and details, even I like with that expression character expression because all of them have their own unique impression. At first, this anime gives us a lesson that playing gambling can make you orgasm or make you a psychopathic-like. I mean, \u00e2\u0080\u009cKaiji: Ultimate Survivor\u00e2\u0080\u009d does it in a unique way because the anime knew how they depict the psychological beside the anime reminds me of \u00e2\u0080\u009cSaw\u00e2\u0080\u009d movie. The anime and the movie both have such a big consequence. If you lose, then you die. Both material always gives such intense impressions that we never know what the characters would be like after that. Meanwhile, \u00e2\u0080\u009cKakegurui\u00e2\u0080\u009d doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem like that. Besides giving the impression of a \u00e2\u0080\u0098psychological\u00e2\u0080\u0099 element, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really see the consequence even though some characters make their lives at stake I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel it too much. Although, the two anime are indeed different from any point of view.\n\nBesides the art style which is so stylized for aesthetic impressions, I love the music in this anime. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the best anime soundtracks I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever heard of the piano impressions, beat, and tempo played in a way that is so unique as to remind me of the opening theme song of \u00e2\u0080\u009cDeath Parade.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The opening theme song is one of the best for its jazzy impressions. Sometimes, it gives an intense scene because it fits with the music and scene, especially at the gambling scene. The voice acting is impressive too and almost everybody because they are sometimes out of character. Saori Hayami is probably the best in this anime because she portrays many personalities with different voices in every characteristic of Jabami itself. Likewise, Mariya Isei for her psychopathic madness voices, Mayu Udono who sound cute characters but it turns out you know well what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to happen, and Yuu Serizawa who is the same.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cKakegurui: Compulsive Gambler\u00e2\u0080\u009d put gambling in a low-stakes. Besides I also like this anime because of several reasons, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of those shows. Too promising at the beginning, but the more distant it is, the more predictable because the story seems flat. The art gives aesthetic impressions which I love that so much as well as the soundtrack and voice acting in this anime, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so impressive. The characters may not be the worst because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the main point which makes this anime has an interesting impression too. There are so many twists which I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think are too exciting even more ruining to the scenes. Turns out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cKakegurui\u00e2\u0080\u009d is one of the most memorable for me even I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad this anime got its second season. However, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a bit of April joke out of season when changing gambling as the weirdest fetishes ever.

Neon Genesis Evangelion, Ranma \u00c2\u00bd, Cowboy Bebop, and Akira are just a few such anime for me, if you were wondering. That isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t to say the impression is always a pleasant one. Fuuka is _also_ an anime I just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shake, no matter how much I want to. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the few anime I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve completed that just left a bitter taste in my mouth that no amount of mouthwash can erase.\n\nThis review isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for the anime, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give you the quick and dirty - Fuuka initially started as a slice-of-life about a shy, awkward boy and his outgoing classmate. The anime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focus shifts onto music, but what will stick out more is a frustrating love triangle and the annoying two main characters. Infuriatingly, the lesser of the two love interests wins out. \n\nMost notably, towards the end of the anime, Fuuka is seconds away from being hit by a truck. This would be the most dramatic, the most interesting moment for the show. \n\nShe inexplicably survives and the mediocre anime concludes predictably a few episodes later. Anyone who follows this anime knows that in the manga, Fuuka does indeed perish due to the vehicle, named Truck-kun by viewers.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make no bones about it. I picked up the manga so I could see Fuuka die.\nimg220(https://pm1.narvii.com/6367/a31afc62dfbbd3f67b4a9186db801e48dafbe84f_hq.jpg)\nimg220(https://images.sgcafe.net/2017/03/truck-kun.png)\n\n\nAnd I was satisfied. She was, in fact, quite dead. The question becomes, what comes after? Is it worth reading until the end? Is it even worth reading up to the arrival of Truck-kun?\n\nFuuka starts off interesting enough. Sure, Fuuka may be annoying initially, but the premise of a socially awkward boy who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obsessed with Twitter opening up to people is interesting enough. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surprisingly not too hamfisted either. Compared to the anime at least, the love-triangle is handled fine, and I care about the band members. The character dynamic is good and it actually doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take forever for relationships to progress. The band aspect is interesting, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s genuine conflict, and the characters are likable enough. I was actually surprised that I ended up liking Fuuka as much as I did. I hate to admit it, but I was actually kind of sad (in addition to gleeful) when her day of reckoning came. So over all, yeah, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say the manga starts off pretty solid. Its funny, its interesting, its fast-paced.\n\nAnd the truck-kun incident is handled pretty well, too. It comes out of nowhere, yes, but I enjoyed seeing the grief that the characters dealt with as a result of Fuuka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death. All-in-all, pretty good stuff.\n\nWhat comes after is when things start to fall apart.\n\nThe main character, Yuu, soon decides he wants to carry out Fuuka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dream of having their band perform at a famous concert venue where The Hedgehogs (their favorite musical group) played. After getting the band back together, they decide to start chasing the dream they shared in order to make it a reality.\n\nSoon, Yuu runs into a singer who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coincidentally _also_ named Fuuka and bears an uncanny resemblance to the Fuuka we know. The two soon grow closer, and any reader who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even a bit savvy can guess what happens next. This alone will make many roll their eyes, but there are even weirder plot points to come. I actually think plot points such as these are some of Fuuka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s greatest strengths. As insane and/or contrived as they are, they keep the story interesting and keep readers on their toes.\n\nUnfortunately, these are few and far between and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re left with more mundane nonsense plot points, which are _great_ at irritating readers. Not to mention, Fuuka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s greatest weakness - poor plot progression. They say the journey is more important than the destination, but Fuuka wants to cross a country in a broken-down jalopy. We get nowhere fast and even as the band plays more and more concerts and gains notoriety, it always seems like they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in dire straits, with no clout to speak of. This is my biggest problem with Fuuka: the plot seems to slow to a crawl and become cyclical in nature. Band is struggling and practically unheard of, band overcomes struggle and become more famous, band is struggling and practically unheard of. The manga can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really seem to shake this until close to the end of its 195-chapter run. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t doubt this is how it is for many bands in the real world, but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make it any more enjoyable to read, in my opinion.\n\nIt just really gets tiring after a while. With Fuuka, however, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come to enjoy boredom, because when Fuuka isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t boring, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s infuriating, with idiotic plot points and characters acting dumb. You have no idea how many times a character frustrated me due to a stupid misunderstanding. In particular, one character acts nothing but horrible to the main characters, but they learn to love them and brush the behavior aside as \u00e2\u0080\u009ctough love\u00e2\u0080\u009d or something.\n\nBut...I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, the series certainly has its moments. The last arc in particular was terrific and adrenaline pumping. The long journey finally seemed to pay off, with the main characters growing, their skills being shown, and all the friends they made along the way having meaningful roles in the end. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little too late, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be lying if I said it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bring a smile to my face, make me exclaim in shock, and think the journey was pretty good in hindsight.\n\nDo I think Fuuka is a good manga? No. The last paragraph might just be stockholm syndrome speaking. Fuuka, as the sum of its parts, is average at best. It has some genuine great chapters, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re grossly outnumbered by chapters that are \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeh\u00e2\u0080\u009d at best. \n\nIt isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t terrible, but if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s merit to it, then who do I recommend it to, and __how__ do I do it? As a general reader, the evolution of a band is a cool concept, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure there are other manga that do it better. The romance grows more and more lackluster as the series grows on. Really, the only person that might get something out of this are fellow viewers of the anime adaptation. If you saw the anime and for some reason want to see how things could have turned out, you could pick up Fuuka. Even if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that great on its own, it still blows the anime out the water and perhaps you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll feel that your time wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wasted, after all (Koyuki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still largely a joke, though).\n\nBut I try my best not to rate fiction in relation to other works. With this in mind, Fuuka simply isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worth the time investment. On concept, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great, in execution, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s painfully average seven times out of ten. \n\n5.9/10\n\n\n"}, {"id": 3772, "score": 56, "body": "<center>img600(https://i.imgur.com/rtVpJGQ.png)</center>\n# ~~~__Spoiler-free review__~~~\n<n></n>\n# Review in brief:\n\nFullmetal Alchemist possesses a dark tone, some amount of moral ambiguity (mixed in with the usual force-fed black-and-white morals), and frequent drama within a shounen adventure core.  Unfortunately, despite its high underlying potential it chooses not to maintain the level of detail needed to keep its ambitious story consistent or preserve suspension of disbelief, prioritizing its quota for mindless action and comedy instead.\n\n# Review in full:\n\n2003's Fullmetal Alchemist may reside in the shadow of its younger, manga-faithful sibling FMA: Brotherhood, but many still recommend watching it beforehand.  It is said to feature a slower & more digestible pace, a darker tone, and deeper thematics.  I haven't watched Brotherhood for comparison but I can attest that this anime does at least attempt to make good on these points but not in an effective manner.  In fact, the theme of this review will be that this anime does have many commendable aspects to it, but it's mixed with some wholly uninspired elements that result in a product with a frustrating lack of purpose akin to a gem-encrusted plunger.\n\nEven from the very beginning problems are made apparent, thanks to the decision to start off in the middle of the story.  The first episode starts by saying close to nothing about the setting & lore and simply throws the Elric brothers into action while bluntly stating their basic motive of \"get our old bodies back\". It establishes rules for its world (mostly pertaining to its alchemy) and immediately proceeds to break them without explaining what allows it to do so.  This occurs throughout the show, but starting off like this makes it especially difficult to suspend disbelief as it keeps happening.  Some of these rule-breaks are explained many episodes later but said explanations are often done quickly and hand-waved away, as though the anime doesn't want to explain itself.  These faults in the storytelling appear in both visuals and dialogue.\n\n<center>img400(https://i.imgur.com/P5kY8xD.gif)\n_Yep, there was totally enough metal in the stone wall to make a cast-iron door complete with bull-themed decor.  What are tailings anyway?_</center><n></n>\nThe main issue with the visuals is that the explanations for many transmutations don't match up with their animations, making them hard to believe. In the first scenario Edward is able to transmute both a wood-and-metal spear and a large stone wall from sand with only the slightest visible disruption/reduction in said sand.  It's animated as though these objects teleported into the scene rather than created from nearby materials (the given explanation) and given some of their compositions relative to the materials they spawned from they may as well have.  A large amount of transmutations have this problem.  Edward is also able to animate a giant stone statue early on without any known catalyst.  This is given a explanation through dialogue but only at the very end of the show and even that explanation is questionable, vaguely expressed (in an attempt to cover multiple inconsistencies at once), and something Edward had no idea about at the time.  More to the point, the show waited nearly 50 episodes before even attempting to explain where the energy needed to make a multistory stone statue walk somewhere else (last I checked statues aren't even made with functioning joints) comes from in a system that supposedly requires \"equivalent exchange\" to function.  In the end, transmutations with this inconsistency are never directly questioned.  They are only indirectly and partially answered in about 40 seconds of exposition.\n\nIn spite of its exposition issues, the story of Fullmetal Alchemist is actually quite involved and entertaining.  There's many intriguing details and events that build up who the Elric brothers are and what they do.  At the same time there's also plenty of needless comedy and filler fights thrown in that detract from what is a touching journey at its best and make it a stale shounen slog at its worst.  It is this disjointed method of storytelling that sees serious plot points explained in a convoluted way, raising many questions (such as the previously mentioned transmutation issues) and forgetting half of them before a point is reached where the show feels comfortable with providing answers.  Perhaps it would be more tolerable if these sidetracks provided a worthwhile experience, but when half of the jokes are just Edward having a height complex & Al being an empty suit of armor and half of the fights are mostly basic melee slugouts with minimal amounts of alchemy involved it's hard not to see it all as being tacked-on.\n\n<center>img400(https://i.imgur.com/uxOV0r2.jpg) img400(https://i.imgur.com/V7nPP5O.jpg)\n_Apparently using alchemy __before__ it's absolutely necessary is just too darn complicated for ~~the writers~~ Edward._</center><n></n>\nThe Elric brothers' journey is by no means a walk in the park and they often find themselves getting involved with shady characters and sinister happenings. Sometimes rather complicated (for a shounen anime) issues that have no clear-cut answer are brought up, leaving the brothers (and the viewer) to find their own. At other times the show goes out of its way to be extra dark and force-feed a particular moral to the audience not with reason but with shock value through gratuitous violence & gore or emotional manipulation. It's frustrating because there are plenty of moments in the story where interesting subjects and events come up that practically beg to be mentally digested but there's also many moments where the show clearly expects your brain to be turned off.  I consider dark & edgy stories to be a guilty pleasure of mine but here it mostly felt unnecessary.\n\nIn particular, the ending emphasizes a lot of the problems I've mentioned and raises many unanswered questions.  Many actions taken beforehand (such as motivations for some of the villains as well as some of the lessons the Elric brothers learn and grow from) are rendered pointless by it, and it's not helped by all the meandering & pointlessly melodramatic dialogue leading up to it.  It also creates a lot of holes in the final explanation of \"the gate\".  I won't spoil \"the gate\" here as it's a major plot element but I will say that the way the ending abuses the function of \"the gate\" by conveniently forgoing the conditions for it to do what it did just 2 episodes after explaining it was its worst aspect since so many key events are built up around it throughout the show.  Out of all the times this anime threw its own logic to the wayside, this last one with no hope of being explained is by far the worst.  It all seemed to happen just to present sequel bait for a continuation (the Conqueror of Shamballa) that doesn't promise to answer those questions.\n\nAll but one of the villains are overly corny, predictable, and simple.  Many of the sin-based homunculi (such as Gluttony and Envy) can be entirely characterized by their names alone.  Many of the villains in general are nothing more than psychopaths that know no other actions than gloat and kill (because what else would they need to know to fight?) and the amount of them means a lot of seeing the same cutout villain appear many, many times with a different face (and not just because characters don't always stay dead when they're killed).  Meanwhile, just about every non-villain character (even the filler episode side characters) can be defined by a sole desire they possess.  This approach to characterization is both nonstandard and uniquely fitting to the underlying theme of the anime, but these characters need more than a desire and a couple bullet-point traits to be truly convincing.  While there are some characters that receive decent development, many of them end up dying partway through, clearing room for much shallower characters that don't really develop.  It's a shame because this clear effort to give as many characters a place in the story as possible (even down to filler episode characters) does end up making the world feel more alive, but only at the high cost of some of the anime's standout characters.\n\n<center>img600(https://i.imgur.com/RKhOhrk.jpg)\n_Enjoy your favorite characters while they last.  No really, not all of them last._</center><n></n>\nOutside of the lacking visual explanations the animation is fairly standard though with the caveat that it tends to go light on the visual effects.  That said, such conservatism doesn't add to its presentation.  On a more positive note the animators did a great job with their use of color palettes to complement each scene.  The sound is of considerable quality with a fair number of memorable, setting-appropriate music pieces and convincing voice acting (I watched the Japanese version).  The OPs are all quite nice as well; so nicely animated at times that it makes the rest of the anime look worse.  All in all, it's enough to make the setting feel fairly convincing and whole, even though maps and regional history are rarely brought up.  This isn't an issue however since the rest can easily be filled in with a grade-schooler's level of understanding on European history.\n\nI could say so much more about this anime (even without veering into spoiler territory) but it would all just be discussing more fantastic toppings on a cardboard pizza.  I really want to like this anime and aside from the ending I don't regret any time I spent on it.  Unfortunately everything awesome thing it does is sandwiched between two unbearably uninspired elements.  It makes me wish I could just pull out the meaningful parts of this show and throw away the poorly utilized shounen action & comedy it was all glued to.\n\n# Verdict:\n\nYou would be hard pressed to find a person who truly dislikes Fullmetal Alchemist's story with its interesting journey and the myriad of themes it at least attempts to explore.  However, that story is put at odds with the shounen conventions it was placed with and the experience is diluted to the point where its standout properties can barely be tasted within the watery and stagnant concoction it became."}, {"id": 3774, "score": 60, "body": "As someone who is not really into the series enough to call himself a fan, I did see the rebooted movie from last year and went to see this with some good excitement. Last year's movie had absolutely gorgeous artwork and great animation. There was an antagonist who was befriended in the end, Ash had a goal of meeting and battling Ho-Oh, and the battles throughout the film were fun and interesting spectacles to see.\n\nThis movie has none of that. Yes, the artwork is good and so is the animation, but there aren't any breathtaking scenes like in the first movie. No gorgeous artwork or background shots. Just standard shots without anything specifically noticeable unlike _I Choose You!_ where we saw a butterfree fly off with a flock of others or the beautiful vistas of the forest and nature. But what sets this film apart and makes it so boring is that there is no central antagonist to it. The main conflict of the movie is two disasters concerning the environment and the town itself. The second half of the movie is Ash and a group of relative strangers the movie gave focus to trying to stop the disasters (non-natural, of course) from destroying the town and hurting people and Pokemon.\n\nBecause there is no central antagonist, we don't have the interest of seeing his or her evil ways put to an end. There is no motivation to see justice served. There also aren't really any Pokemon battles. Yes, there are a few tiny skirmishes that involve capturing Pokemon, but nothing like last year's reboot. The battles in this film are very short, basic, and nothing spectacular. They are not a focus in this movie like they were in last year's because the point is the story. But there again is the problem. The story is just characters reacting to some disasters that hurt people and Pokemon. There isn't a fight or big climactic battle like Ash & Pikachu vs Ho-Oh or the mean guy who only wanted powerful Pokemon.\n\nThus we get a film about five or so random characters and how they interact with a festival going on in the town the movie takes place in (I forget the name). There is a contest going on, but naturally it's interrupted early on in the film. Team Rocket makes an appearance and causes the disaster to happen, but they don't do much else besides that. They don't get punished in the end or anything. They are more of a plot device to cause a conflict than any real villain. They are a tool in this movie to move the plot forward.\n\nAll in all, I was disappointed. I wanted plenty of awesome battles. I wanted an antagonist who had to be beaten and maybe befriended. I wanted Ash to have a real goal besides \"help save the town.\" I wanted the characters to do something besides saving a town via methods that don't really involve fighting other Pokemon. Hopefully next year's movie is better."}, {"id": 3777, "score": 55, "body": "With an interesting premise that is dark and alluring, this show looked very promising. The thing with some anime adaptions is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to pull off while the source material is still on-going. Studios and Staff that take on this type of project are now tasked with a challenging job of getting the execution right. Akuma no Riddle is sadly held back from the poor execution on many of the aspects, ideas and story elements it presented that prevents the show from being great.\n\nAdapted from Yun Kouga's manga, Akuma no Riddle follows the path of Tokaku Azuma, a seasoned assassin who transfers to a private boarding school in Myoujou Academy to attend Class Black. It consists of 13 students, 12 being assassins and 1 being the target in Haru Ichinose, a bright and cheerful girl who aims to become friends with her peers. Unknowing to her, things soon take a turn for the worst. The purpose of this Class is more of a test or game for the assassins, they have to find out who is the target among them and then assassinate her within the rules that have been established. The ruling is that the target must be informed that she is going to be targeted and killed and that it must happen within 48 hours after issuing the notice. Failing to follow the ruling or the completion of the assassination within the time frame has one expelled from Class Black. If successful, one is granted any wish of their desire.\n\nTokaku concludes that Haru is the target after thoroughly examining her peers and has her sights on her. She finds out that Haru will become her roommate and after spending the time to getting to know her more, she becomes drawn to her to the point where she defects to her side and becomes her protector as they both strive to graduate Class Black. This is how the story begins and I found this rather interesting. I like the whole idea of this survival concept but as the story progresses, it felt that it was following an episodic format where an episode is dedicated to each one of the girls trying to kill Haru. While we get some flashbacks about their past and how they came to Class Black, it leaves every character besides Tokaku and Haru one episode for development. This led to shallow characters, rushed conclusions and a drowned out overarching story which for the most part makes Akuma no Riddle fail to make anything meaningful. \n\nThis is where I felt Akuma no Riddle was lacking and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how the show handles its characters. I wish there was more exploration with our main protagonists though we get to see their true self behind the fa\u00c3\u00a7ade they put on and also learn important details of their past. For the rest of the characters, due to time constraints of only 12 episodes, it was a tough ask to get more from them or to care for them. This is a big flaw, given the setup of the show is extremely character driven and with the \u00e2\u0080\u0098assassination of the week\u00e2\u0080\u0099 approach it gives limited ways for development, which in this case comes from a flashback, what they want for their reward or how they failed the assassination. One episode for development is simply not enough to feel invested.\n\nOne of the things to appreciate about Akuma no Riddle is its distinctive look and style. The world is well designed, the art style and colour palette used helped create a dark and eerie atmosphere which increased the intensity of the assassinations. The character designs were very well done and each character's look suited their personalities. Diomedea studio did ok with the animation, it was consistent despite drops in quality occasionally. Majority of the action scenes were very fluid and choreographed very well. An interesting choice the show implemented was the custom Ending that each episode got dedicated to each character of the series. I found that very creative and it added more content\u00e2\u0080\u0094showing a little summary about their story.\n\nThe score is mainly fast-paced and dark atmospheric tracks to keep you engaged in the assassinations but no particular track was inherently memorable. Immediately I found myself hooked to the Opening song, \"Soushou Innocence\" by Maaya Uchida. It really sets the mood and tone for the series while also fitting the themes. As mentioned before, I was pleased by the custom Endings and to go along with the different animation used in each one was also different songs. This is what made the Endings so refreshing and another plus factor in the creativity category. I had no issues regarding the voice acting, each of the voices used fitted the design and personality of the character. They deserve praise for showcasing the characters true killer instinct perfectly both in and outside of the assassinations.\n\nWhen the series began, I noticed it had a \"Yuri\" tag but that was later switched with \u00e2\u0080\u0098Shoujo-ai\u00e2\u0080\u0099. Call me blind if I missed anything but there was no Yuri, sure there were hints with Tokaku and Haru's relationship but nothing serious or anything that would turn viewers off who may not like Yuri. The concept of survival game is nothing new but it did attempt to give it a bit more flair, something I can appreciate. The rating I had for it before the last two episodes was a bit higher but I had to bring it down because I felt the ending was anticlimactic and was disappointed on the route it chose. Despite its flaws Akuma no Riddle can still be an enjoyable thriller for those who like episodic series with lots of action, it has its moments and I felt that I may have enjoyed it a bit more if I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go into the show with high expectations."}, {"id": 3782, "score": 65, "body": "Have you ever felt disheartened after seeing a person with more talent figure out what you have been working on for days in a matter of minutes? She then goes on to receive rewards for her work while you sit on the side and you ask yourself, \"why did I even try\"? This has happened countless times to people at home, school, sports and at work. When we reward people for their talent. The competition feels the gap in skill and loses confidence in their capabilities while the talented individual doesn't feel challenged or a need to work hard to stay at the top. The themes in Hanebado! suggests that we should stop rewarding people for their talent and here's why. The purpose of rewarding people is to help them improve themselves and stay motivated. Motivation explains why a person chooses one action over another. A motivated person faces challenging problems head-on and works to find better solutions to the same problem. They tend to be more creative. Motivation leads to success. Without motivation, people lose sight of what they want to accomplish with their life.\n\nSuch is the message that Hanebado! tries to convey with its characters through the story that is adapted from Kousuke Hamada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s manga \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the story of the race between the tortoise and the hare is a great metaphor on this topic. The hare was more talented but he lost motivation to keep on running. The one who won, in the end, was the tortoise who put much more effort than the hare to win. This best explains our main characters, you have the prodigy in Ayano Hanesaki, daughter of the most decorated badminton champion in Japan with all the raw talent in the world. Then we have Nagisa Aragaki, blessed with height but determined to be the hardest work in the room in order to be the best. The story starts off with an event that takes place several months prior to the main story, the event is a match at a national high-level competition for juniors where Ayano and Nagisa square off. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a real cinematic that you have to see for yourself, some of the best animation sequences you will ever see in anime. The end result of the match leads both characters to their lowest point, resulting in a lot of frustrations. Now in the present, both characters are in high school and the fates would have them meet again.\n\nNagisa is determined to improve her skills through pure effort but is doing so at the cost of her interpersonal relationships and health. Ayano, on the other hand, is just purely talented but is hesitant to play badminton because she views it as a pointless sport to play. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a battle of raw, natural talent versus tirelessly hard work that pits the girls as seemingly inevitable rivals despite their position on the same team. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very easy conflict to invest into, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to see that Nagisa and Ayano\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future rivalry will help drive each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal development and uncover the motivations beneath their actions. The two have a troubled past and are both struggling with their relation to the sport, but coming from very different places. You see them face their demons that they fight and struggle against internal and how they confront their fears overcome mental obstacles. Hanebado! fleshes out the main characters through the perspective of side characters, they are used to support the main characters \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Erena for Ayano and Riko for Nagisa. A lot of the focus is on Ayano, the way they handle her split personalities was very messy and cringe at times but all at the same time the show is sort of pitting the viewers against her in favour of Nagisa. You start to get lost in the direction the show is going in.\n\nHanebado! depicts women as driven, despairing, and headstrong in the same fashion as many male sports anime protagonists and for the most part, are taken seriously. Furthermore, the characters are physically strong and play at a high level from the get-go. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a shame that the character drama \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Ayano in particular \u00e2\u0080\u0093 managed to undo some of the good things the show actually does portray very well, it gets to the point where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s irritatingly unbearable. A strength is how great the animation is, its so stunningly detailed in capturing the realism of the characters in badminton matches \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from their reactions, body language, attention to detail on the movement of clothing, perspiration and muscles. Both girls fly across the court in a way that makes both their exhaust and energy feel real. The various camera angles along with slow-mo and stop-motion effects used help emphasize the badminton racket, the net and the shuttlecock responses. Lindenfilms really pulled a rabbit out of the hat with their work, its cinematography gold albeit a few times where the visuals and animation saw drops in quality.\n\nIn the sound department, the soundtracks are standard for sports, you could probably pick a few that really help build the atmosphere in the tense and emotional moments. I know when it came to the big matches, especially with Ayano and Nagisa, the tracks used brought the hype to intensify the moment. When you have an epic music playing in the background over top-notch animated sports sequences, it turns into a spectacle. Both OP and ED are nice but nothing special. Voice acting did its job but I only felt connected to Nagisa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s VA in Miyuri Shimabukuro. She knew how to make her voice fit with Nagisa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appearance and personality, knowing how to sound strong and stern while also showing the feminine side of her tone. The sound effects are just as good, we get to her loud solid hits of a racket against a shuttlecock with all the whoosh and booms along with the sounds of rubber shoes rubbing against the court etc.\n\nHanebado! is more of a \u00e2\u0080\u0098what-could-be\u00e2\u0080\u0099 if handled much better. It started off with a lot of promise, there is a lot of emotional stakes on the line, it had all the setups of being a real character-driven story where all the aspects to \u00e2\u0080\u0098talent versus hard work\u00e2\u0080\u0099 concept are deeply explored. But the writing loses its way and the melodrama gets out of control but it has some redeeming qualities that still make it a fine anime. It can be a hit or miss. Its been a long time coming but now a series exists that brings women off the sidelines and onto the same field as their male counterparts in a lot more serious way. Rather than functioning as a group that pops up when the boys need encouragement. In the end, Nagisa ends up being the saving grace of the show. You become invested in her character, you appreciate the sacrifices she has made to achieve her goals and you cheer her on all the way. When the slow build up to the final showdown arrives between Nagisa and Ayano it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a thrilling spectacle of how hard work can overcome talent."}, {"id": 3797, "score": 65, "body": "Japan is famous for many things. Seen as a hub of wacky trends and colourful fashions, people associate Japan with innovation and uniqueness. However, there is another part of Japanese entertainment which is something of a phenomenon and now dominates the industry. It is Idol Culture, and it is attracting people both in the country and overseas. This massive industry is getting bigger all the time and generates huge amounts of money for the music industry. Idols are everywhere, on every TV and billboard. Young people dream of becoming them and look up to them. However, despite the flashy perception of an idol\u00e2\u0080\u0099s celebrity life and the glamour associated with it, there is a dark side to this life and this industry. Wake Up, Girls! Asks the questions. Is it really so good being an idol in Japan? Is it liberating, or just entrapping? Lucrative, or just exploitative? And does it matter either way, if people want to be idols despite the drawbacks?\n\nAlready smitten the \u00e2\u0080\u009cidol and music\u00e2\u0080\u009d sub-genre, Wake Up, Girls certainly does present a unique experience from its other counterparts: not as campy, affable, or imaginative\u00e2\u0080\u0094it is at least very capable of painting a grounded and merciless depiction of the idol industry. Not a feat attempted by many titles, yet one that is handled moderately well and produces some fascinating results. To this end, it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the only thing that makes the series interesting, but if you like the typical \u00e2\u0080\u009cdark horses becoming worthy competitors\u00e2\u0080\u009d troupe then this is the one for you. Of course, calling the Wake Up, Girls! a dark horse is more than an understatement. With the prequel movie showing how the girls came together and to be, the series chronicles their struggle to become fine idols. They can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t dance well, but can carry a tune with ease, and seem to be only kept together from becoming just \u00e2\u0080\u009canother idol unit\u00e2\u0080\u009d by the graces of former I-1 Club\u00e2\u0080\u0099s center, Mayu Shimada that joins up to reclaim some happiness that she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find before. Just like with the prequel that makes Mayu the main focus, the TV series does as well for most of the earlier episodes, but also develops the other characters personalities later on as the girls run into roadblocks, both external and internal that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to be recoverable from with each episode, but does in the end. \n\nAiri Hayashida becomes a more skilful and confident member, a better, stalwart leader in Yoshino Nanase, and Nanami Hisami puts her Hikarizuka Theatre dreams on hold for the sake of the group. Considering how compact and rushed the episodes seem from a writing standpoint, the execution of ideas actually pans better than expected to create a nice journey of drama and a few laughs along the way. Regrettably, it does hit a few rough spots with regards to how some of the elements like drama plays out or how some of the elements come off less than stellar, yet doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly pose anything of serious consequence that subtracts from the series. Although, where Wake Up, Girls! journey takes a more \u00e2\u0080\u009cCinderella story\u00e2\u0080\u009d approach, their rivals, I-1 club is the more calculating and more so on the ruthless side of the idol industry, as the show gives a few insights on how the I-1 club girls unit produces perfection. Admittedly, more of the harsh punishment that goes on in the unit seems like sensationalism to many viewers, yet with the show throwing around various call-backs, references, and allusions to the idol scene, it is believable and portrayed as truth. \n\nAs previously mentioned above, Wake Up, Girls! takes a different approach from other idol shows in that it reveals the idol industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dark side, a lot of it is very disturbing. Our heroines\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rival is this monolithic entity that treats girls as cogs in a machine, tosses them out at the drop of the hat, pits them against each other in this vicious environment, and no doubt overworks them and refuses to give them overtime pay\u00e2\u0080\u0094actually it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unclear if they receive any pay at all. It makes you think if this industry was truly founded on child labour. Idols being forced to project an image of pure innocence, the amount of sexual harassment and exploitation that occurs behind scenes and dealing with numerous creeps daily, is it really worth going through all of that at the expense of your own well-being? Very hard to imagine how physically, emotionally and mentally draining it might be. Episode 9 is a highlight example of most of these things while episode 2 goes into detail of the sexual harassment and exploitation side of things. Ironically, the show tries to have its cake and eat it too. The girls are being stared at and even groped by the creeps they have to perform in front of while wearing skimpy swimsuits. While it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an eye-opening commentary on not only fanservice but sexual harassment and exploitation, the very next episode has a straightforward fanservice segment by having some of the girls appear on TV in swimsuits which only sends mix messages to the viewers.\n\nWith studio Ordet at the helm of Wake Up, Girls! the bar is set low when you take into account their previous lacklustre titles. Trying to be one of few that implements full-frame animation in lieu of CGI for some the dance numbers and performances, it just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work or maintain any consistency and results in being jagged and awkward. This might be in an effort to further the authentic concept or break away from the traditional means of doing things, yet not exactly the series you want to attempt something so high budgeted when the artwork itself is not well-defined. Examples of this can been seen in the character designs that look generic in the case of the Wake Up, Girls! members that are only saved by unique identifiers such as Airi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s facial birthmark or Miyu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009ctwin tail\u00e2\u0080\u009d hairstyle. Most of the music, vocal or non-vocal also fall into the category of average\u00e2\u0080\u0094accredited to Satoru K\u00c5\u008dsaki, Ordet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in-house composer. The instrumental and vocal pieces seemed lacking or limited for an idol anime series\u00e2\u0080\u0094yet I did enjoy some of the vocal pieces like the Opening theme, \u00e2\u0080\u009c7 Girls War\u00e2\u0080\u009d that fits in perfectly with the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motif.\n\nWithout reservations, I can say that Wake Up, Girls! might not resonant with those that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so friendly toward idols or idol anime, but will at least be appreciative of the story of a bunch of nobodies close to becoming something more. It does have its fair share of problems when it comes piecing together general story elements and even bigger problems maintaining its animation, but elsewhere, the series does more than it needs to. I appreciate its depiction on the idol industry but it was lacking in other areas that can really make it a hit or miss. Being an idol can be fun, but it requires a lot of effort, luck, and sacrifice as well. Idols work to the bone in an effort to be everything Japan wants them to be, but perhaps this is unattainable. Does it depend on what the idol wants more, fame and recognition, or a normal life? Next time you watch famous Japanese idols on your TV screen, looking happy and smiling for the cameras, remember that there is a hugely dark and negative side to this industry which is often not addressed, but which perhaps should be."}, {"id": 3808, "score": 60, "body": "img820(https://www.absoluteanime.com/outlanders/index03.jpg)\n\nFor someone who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s read the source material, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to look at an adaptation objectively \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not trying to, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll always think about how it differs and measures up the source material.\n\nAnd let me tell you, this ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it chief.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll only compare the OVA to the manga briefly, because as futile as it is, I try reviewing works themselves, without considering their relation to other creations. For one, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really capture the tone of the manga. The comedy that was sparse in the manga is cranked up to eleven. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s funny, yes, but not very accurate. Compressing a 33-chapter manga into a ~50 minute OVA means that many characters are cut out and only a portion of the story is shown \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a revised beginning and a slightly altered section from roughly the middle of the story. The stakes on paper are high, but in practice very low. If you wanted an alternate take on the story, then by all means watch, but it is in no way superior to the manga.\n\nOutlanders is the story of Tetsuya, a newspaper photographer who runs into an alien named Kahm. After encountering him, Kahm decides she wants Tetsuya as a fiancee.\n\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not much to it, which is natural, given the short run-time. The romance (if you can even call it that) doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any time to develop and Kahm then Tetsuya is inexplicably enamored with the other member. The OVA exacerbates the biggest problem of the manga \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the lackluster romance.  In addition, it does away with its biggest strength: the drama. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talk of an alien invasion, but it effectively doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no sense of adventure. The little action that remains is quite gory, with no payoff. The violent scenes are never mentioned again and achieve no purpose other than giving the anime a bit of an identity crisis.\n\nThe animation looks pretty enough.\n\nThe way I recommend you watch Outlanders is to stick your finger in your ear, find the switch inside your head, and turn your brain off. If Outlanders is good at one thing it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comedy. There were times when I was legitimately laughing and the irreverent tone helps with this. It helps that in the English dub, Sean Schemmel of Dragon Ball fame plays Tetsuya and gives quite an animated performance. If you like a bit of crude humor, then Outlanders will be up your alley.\n\nStill, as funny as it can be at times, the anime still isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that great. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s less than an hour, so if you want a dumb comedy and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a lot of time to invest, then you should check out Outlanders. Just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect anything great out of it, though.\n\nThe insert song\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty cool, though.\n\n6/10"}, {"id": 3821, "score": 64, "body": "Before I start this review: This is my first one, so beware.\n\nThat said, let's get right into it:\n\nNozo x Kimi is mainly an ecchi somewhat romantic comedy with a strong emphasize on the ecchi part. \nFor the inclined viewer of this 3part OVA it means a ton of panty shots, groping, a few nipples and other nice visuals to behold with all the fun little accidents and intentional PLOT accompanying it. \n\nAs the source material is the manga written and illustrated by Wakou Honna, the story is based on a similar premise: It's about two individuals revealing each other to themselves by peeping or at least one's reaction to it, which is not unlike her other creation Nozoki Ana. \nYet Nozo x Kimi is overall way more harmless and less dark (in the OVA) as it focuses more on the interpersonal relationship between the mcs Suga and Komine, who interact with people they are more or less interested in. The story mainly lives off the interaction of Kimio and their growing relationship and some running gags, about how much one is a perv and the other a ~~literal closet perv ~~ good hearted boy .\n\nThe three OVA-episodes are visually nice regarding coloring and style although it cannot quite convey the facial emotions on which the manga heavily relies due to the shift to an easier to animate style. The animation is not bad (imho) and the voice acting is quite enjoyble while the music is at best unnoticable, in fact don't bother with the ED at all, the song is funny trash and the visuals are only recaps. \n\nStorywise the first two OVAs were pretty much the same as in the manga apart from it choronological order and left me overall very satisfied with the adaption. \nStill if it weren't for episode 3 that seemed to miss the tone of the source material by overexerting some character traits (like making a certain character unnecessary meaner or another way more stupid) or completely missinterpreting motivations while at least clogging up the plotholes (by implementing some context scenes out of order or simply inventing new-ones which led to said changes in characterization and tone) accordingly . \nEpisode 3 is pretty much why this OVA fails to deliver the good points of this manga, which leaves it as a whole only little bit better than a mediocre product that entertains but doesn't really entices one into reading the manga.\nLike already said above the story lives off the two main characters, whereas Komine is a rather well-fleshed out character I really enjoyed watching, by reminding me a little of a nicer version of Senjogahara. While Kimio is at least from time to time (disregard most of EP3 he's misrepresented) a good fit and not a complete loser. \n\nTL;DR: Fun ecchi shots, KOMINE, nice visuals, KOMINE , bad music, good VA, KOMINE, good production values a decent adaption which fails to advertise for the manga. \n"}, {"id": 3833, "score": 55, "body": "This review contains spoilers\n\n---\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never good to start this sort of thing off with a negative, so I will say, before I begin in earnest, that *Blood-C* is far from the worst anime I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen (that title probably still goes to  the sole episode I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve watched of *Modern Magic Made Simple*), nor the worst I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever completed (*Occult Academy*\u00e2\u0080\u0099s final act is far more insulting and the film *Expelled From Paradise* is much more boring). With that out of the way, I should note though, that *Blood-C* takes an earnest swing at being among the most pointless.\n\nThe core concept of *Blood-C* isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hard to grasp. Our protagonist is Saya, a high schooler who is also a miko who, at night, defends her town from vicious demons called Elder Bairns with the help of a sacred katana and her own ability to heal quickly. \n\nimg880(https://i.imgur.com/KfskuhN.png)\n\nThis simple premise is an iteration of among the oldest stories in fiction--protagonist with special abilities slays wicked monsters--and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really, genuinely quite hard to screw this up. A better series, even if it were not exactly transcendent, would milk this setup for all the pulpy action that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth. Indeed, the first few episodes are promising on that front. After sitting through about 15 minutes of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dullest high school life anime, the first few episodes conclude with Saya fighting a Bairn. These scenes are, from the series\u00e2\u0080\u0099 start to its end, the major highlights. The fights are (with one exception), universally well-choreographed and animated, the earlier ones especially might remind watchers of the video game *Bloodborne* and if the show had stuck to this formula throughout, it might not\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever become *great* exactly, but it probably would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve at least remained fun.\n\n*Blood-C*\u00e2\u0080\u0099s idea of raising the stakes is where the real problems start to arise. About halfway through the series, the first named character (Nene, one of Saya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s classmates along with her twin Nono) bites the bullet by having her head quite messily chomped off by a Bairn. This starts an escalation of sorts, where the series seems to confuse intensity with bodycount. What starts as initially shocking and frightening quickly becomes merely gross, then dull, then outright boring. By the time a squadron of dividing bunny demons show up in the series\u00e2\u0080\u0099 final episode, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re more likely to sigh than be revolted when one of them grabs a gaggle of townspeople, puts them in a giant sack, and blends them with an eggbeater. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nauseating sure, but given enough exposure the human brain will get sick of just about anything, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as true of the countless gory (and in one of the series\u00e2\u0080\u0099 more unpleasant fixations, vory) deaths here as anything else.\n\nIf the problem was *merely* that the series didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know when the chain of messy gruesomeness became too much, it might be a glaring flaw in an otherwise good show. Unfortunately, it marries that problem to an equally large one, which is that aside from Saya herself, who is a cool protagonist if not an especially layered or thoughtfully-written one, it is difficult to impossible to care about pretty much *any* of the other characters. So, while it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shocking when Nene gets her head chomped off, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not uspetting because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Nene specifically, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a swerve. Similarly, in a later episode when a giant frog-crab-spider Bairn murders the vast majority of Saya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other classmates, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really quite hard to care. It becomes obvious before too long that this is a show that equates bodycount with meaningful narrative development, which is a mistake that can pretty much cripple any attempt at serious storytelling.\n\nimg880(https://i.imgur.com/gVD0mw7.png)\n\nAnd goodness, does it make a genuine attempt at squeezing something resembling an interesting twist into its final two episodes. So it turns out that the entire town that Saya lives in--including her own father--are a manufactured \u00e2\u0080\u009cgame\u00e2\u0080\u009d controlled by a vaguely-motivated villain to test her, Or Something, explanations are offered but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hazy, and even if they weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, this twist (which I am sure is intended to be super shocking) comes in as mentioned, at the tenth episode out of twelve. Even if this *was* an attempt to take the series in some other direction, it is by that point too late for it to matter much. Sadly though, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not even that, as the whole \u00e2\u0080\u009cit was all an experiment!\u00e2\u0080\u009d shtick mostly serves as an excuse to cheat all the named characters that had previously died on-screen back to life with very little attempt at justifying said happening, and then to kill all of them again. Exactly **three** named characters make it out of this series alive; Saya herself, the man who runs the cafe` she eats at every day before school (who turns out to be the mastermind behind it all. Of course), and one of her classmates who turns out to be a woman in her 30s playing at being a high schooler, and has possibly the least personality out of anyone in the core cast.\n\nTo be sure there is detail that could be gone into other than what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve covered here but, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really no point. *Blood-C* is a thoughtlessly-written series that tries desperately to impress you with its bodycount and willingness to show blood, guts, brain matter, and in one deeply unpleasant instance, maggots, splattered all over the settings and the protagonist. Unfortunately; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pointless enough exercise that the main thoughts I came away from the show with were that Saya deserves a better anime to cut up demons in, and that at least the fight sequences were pretty good. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ultimately a pretty iffy way to burn six hours, I cannot in good conscience recommend it to much of anyone, unless they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a truly diehard fan of the larger *Blood* metaseries of which this is a part. Even then, sister series *Blood+* seems to be more well-regarded. At the end of it all, the prevailing feeling one gets with *Blood-C* is that nothing that happened in it actually mattered at all, which is really not what you want to leave your audience walking away thinking.\n\nimg880(https://i.imgur.com/0aDqpna.png)\n"}, {"id": 3835, "score": 66, "body": "~~~img600(https://i.imgur.com/ytyqM6t.png)~~~\n# ~~~__Spoiler-free review__~~~\n<n></n>\n# Review in brief:\n\nPsycho-Pass is dark, brooding, and surprisingly slow in its first season.  It presents the viewer with a lot to reflect on both during and after each episode, making it a fine show to discuss in a group, but it sacrifices the quality of its story & characters to do so.  Combined with its questionable pacing & direction, Psycho-Pass is difficult to recommend, especially if you want action, novelty, or a memorable story.\n\n# Review in full:\n\nIs Psycho-Pass for you?  For all that it is and does, you need to know what Psycho-Pass isn't to figure that out.  Don't watch this if you want lots of action, substantial character growth, any sort of novelty, or an intense thrill-ride.  Aside from the infrequent action scenes (which are mainly just the climaxes for each scenario) Psycho-Pass never so much as intends to possess any of those traits.  Instead its primary goal is to be a dystopian sci-fi crime drama that takes plenty of time to analyze the nature of criminals, stress, and emotional (in)stability within a society that's set up to eliminate these things before they even exist (via the Sibyl system) and what that means for said society.  If you're still interested, know that while this ride does reach its destination, its creators missed many of the aspects that would have made it a memorable experience.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better explained with some mind to the order each point became apparent in, so this review will mix the good and the bad.\n\n<center>_Not really a spoiler, just potentially unsettling._\n~!img400(https://i.imgur.com/eFIYzJS.gif)!~_This anime can get quite gory by the way.  Something else to consider before jumping in._</center>\n\nDespite what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said, the first episode could easily fool you into thinking this is set to become a fast-paced action-thriller.  It utilizes one of its simpler yet darker crime cases as a means to introduce the main characters and the Sibyl system, which their jobs and lives revolve around.  It also flaunts its visual design with plenty of action and gore (more than a typical case in the season does anyhow).  After that first case, much more time is devoted towards piecing together why the criminals do what they do (mainly as a reflection of the Sibyl system and the society it has created).  Much of this is initially done through the investigation of many \u00e2\u0080\u009csmaller\u00e2\u0080\u009d criminals whose cases get about two episodes each, though there are also a few episodes that focus on members of the investigation team instead.  Eventually this leads to an overarching conflict with the main antagonist that spans multiple cases.\n\nThis brings up one of the more questionable decisions made in Psycho Pass\u00e2\u0080\u0099 production: for all of the character driven plotlines, flashbacks, and monologues, there is little in the way of character development or even definition for much of the cast.  Most of the characters remain the same throughout the show, and some hardly display any sort of character during segments focusing on them.  Instead, it's nearly all used to flesh out the setting (Sibyl's society) or present a dilemma/topic regarding the scenario the characters are in for the audience to ponder over.  This is alright for many of the criminals, as their dilemmas (the crimes they're committing) often say enough about their characters anyhow, but the recurring characters suffer for it.  For instance, the enforcer Yayoi has an entire episode revolving around her backstory, and all we learn about her is that she's an ex-musician who developed a taste for music Sibyl disapproves of.  Learning that Sibyl holds such strict regulations over artistry helped flesh out the setting, but definitely was not something that needed over 20 minutes to explain.\n\nAs such, Psycho-Pass' generally slow pace isn't the product of a show that seeks to provoke thought or build a mystery around its setting, despite the fact that it does those things.  It is instead caused by its insistence to indirectly present itself from the perspective of oft-shallow characters, rather than directly focusing on its setting and criminal cases with the characters simply existing within the space created therein.  Perhaps this inefficient method of storytelling was used to justify the awkward 22-episode runtime, which leaves some episodes & segments (including the aforementioned Yayoi episode) sticking out like infectious growths from the anime as a whole.  At its worst this causes this season to skip over what would appear to be important plot details in favor of providing dialogue, leading to overcomplexity when raw exposition is inevitably needed to explain some things and even a few minor plot-holes in its conclusion (more on that later).\n\n<center>img600(https://i.imgur.com/ORruNKz.jpg)\n_Not only does Psycho-Pass' technology show up everywhere but it's also consistently useful to the plot._</center>\n\nPlain characters aside, Psycho-Pass' setting does end up well defined.  A lot of information about the society built around the Sibyl System is given, but slowly and evenly, making it all easily digestible.  Many details of everyday life in this world are briefly shown multiple times (such as the use of holograms to decorate rooms, structures, and even clothing, or the numerous cameras & checkpoints where one's Psycho Pass is checked, updated, and used to determine access rights) which goes a long way in cementing this world as its own society rather than just \"Generic Sci-Fi City #43\".\n\nSuch interactions allow the few standout members of the investigation crew to display development and growth outside of dialogue as their reactions towards societal elements change over time.  They also lead to later criminals leaving bigger impressions than earlier ones, as the viewer can better understand the conditions that led them to their criminal intent and more clearly see which of society's roots they've chosen to tear at.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely why the main antagonist, Shougo Makishima, is remembered fondly by series fans.  While his actual character is rather simple, what he does and why raises (and answers) major questions with many potential standpoints that lead to engaging dialogue both within the show and outside of it (i.e. amongst the audience).\n\nSpeaking of discussion, Psycho-Pass loves to present moral quandaries and bits of philosophy to the viewers as bluntly as it can.  While those who profess to be intellectuals may find the over-the-head delivery of famous dilemmas and quotes from literature & philosophical works dry or pretentious, the laymen won't have to worry so much about understanding what the show is trying to tell them and will have a few sources of further reading on certain plot specifics should they wish to dig deeper.  This is what makes Psycho-Pass better as a group watch versus a solo experience, as the dialogue & issues presented in each situation comes prearranged for discourse between people with different levels of expertise or sources of reference. \n\n<center>img600(https://i.imgur.com/3Rebwfg.jpg)\n_Lots of quality wallpaper material, but wallpapers alone don't make an animation._</center>\n\nWhether the characters are having a philosophical discourse or gorily killing each other, the visual artistry is of decent quality, but for a strange reason.  With a clear & clean style befitting a sci-fi nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempt at utopia chained to the basic expectations for Japanese animation (and rarely more) this anime can provide good wallpapers and some visually engaging static moments but doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t manage to do anything out of the ordinary when in motion (except for the OPs and EDs, which have the highest production quality out of anything in this anime).  Fortunately, the sound quality is consistently both excellent and fitting.  The soundtrack has memorable pieces and can carry the visually unimpressive moments while the voices are distinct, clear, and match their characters.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m convinced you could just close your eyes and listen to this anime while still understanding almost everything that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on.\n\nEarlier I said that this ride reaches its destination, but I would be remiss to say it reached a smooth stop.  While the story around Shougo Makishima serves as an appreciable high point for the show (even alongside the previously mentioned issues), the final case is poorly executed in many ways.  In this arc the characters involved make numerous awkward decisions, often as though they know things they shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t if the story thus far is to be believed, which makes some scenes appear forced and opens up a few plot-holes at critical plot points.  At the same time many conclusions the plot reaches (especially regarding certain characters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 decisions after learning \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really going on\u00e2\u0080\u009d) are disappointingly predictable, passive, and shallow, seemingly just so that the old conflicts would still exist in the sequel.  The predictability of events here also messes with the pacing at the end, making it all feel drawn out and reinforcing the notion that this story never needed 22 episodes to be properly told.\n\n# Verdict:\n\nAll in all, Psycho-Pass\u00e2\u0080\u0099 1st season is a brooding & generally enjoyable sci-fi crime drama but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also thin and lethargic in certain aspects and that keeps it from being a consistently good ride, especially at the end.  Still, it does a passable job of doing what it set out to do while providing a neat sampler plate of intellectual topics to reflect upon afterwards."}, {"id": 3849, "score": 66, "body": "\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow Not to Summon a Demon Lord\u00e2\u0080\u009d is honestly a long title. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just another cliche, light novel adaptation, or Isekai things. Overpowered main character? Check. Harem? Check. All the heroine love the main character? Check. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any weaknesses? Check. So, what distinguishes? This show is indeed one of the cliches where we often see it. But, I think this is more enjoyable than \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn Another World With My Smartphone\u00e2\u0080\u009d and has quite different for this anime. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about escapism, honestly. There is no reason. Even for someone like Kirito, Diablo is a gamer who is trapped in a video game he plays.\n\nHe doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a life. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the same with us. After entering into a video game he played, he considered himself as a demon king from another world. That is, from that video game he plays. There is a slight difference between the game and the world he entered. That is what makes him have to learn a lot from himself. Experience many events, including improving the way he communicate with people.\n\nA concept like this is actually no longer a new thing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Devil Is a Part-Timer!\u00e2\u0080\u009d is one of the opposite anime. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about the demon king who is in the human world. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow Not to Summon a Demon Lord\u00e2\u0080\u009d is exactly what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for those of you who only like typical anime like this. When Diablo was summoned to the fantasy world by two heroines, he turned out using a Magic Reflection by turning the slave effect to the two heroines. So it became the demon king who had two slaves from such heroine. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s simple as that.\n\nSo, where are we? Oh, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forget about the fanservice. Fanservice this and fanservice that. Rem Galeu and Shera L. Greenwood are two main characters besides Diablo. From here, their adventure begins by searching\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. There is no definite initial motive for these three characters until when Diablo discovered that there was a real demon king residing in Rem\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body. Until finally, the main point appears. Diablo has a mission to defeat the demon king and also save Rem from her curse. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s simple, right?\n\nAnyway, Diablo is a joke in this show. Being one of the summoned game characters in a weak small town doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make him have enough motivation why he is there. He is strong and can beat everyone who fights him. I found every action scene appears, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just bland and flat. There is nothing interesting, no strategy, and no tactics. One down, there is more to go. Diablo who made the two heroes became slaves I thought I could guess. After learning a lot from the two of them and knowing more about the background for both of them, we seemed to know how those two heroes felt. Yes, they have a feeling to Diablo. Besides, Diablo is an introvert who is a coward and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know to talk to women. Kind of like that to conclude.\n\nSimply put, Diablo is a generic character for the Isekai genre. Almost everything except \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Rising of the Shield Hero\u00e2\u0080\u009d for the next upcoming anime. I found this light novel is different from such a genre. The development of the main characters here is inversely proportional to zero. The concept of the character is also unique, namely an anti-hero like. Diablo is just a solid character but cares on the one hand. He even prefers to live in that world compared to his native world. Because I thought, I agreed with Diablo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thoughts. Being in an environment where no one believes you, life sucks. When is there a simulation world like in an episode of \u00e2\u0080\u009cUSS Callister\u00e2\u0080\u009d from \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlack Mirror\u00e2\u0080\u009d? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just impatient.\n\nIts potential then disappeared at the end of the episode which I thought was just another pointless thing. Apart from Diablo having a mission to Rem awake the demon king inside her body, the show then further extended it. Glebsklem seems like a pointless character and I think the potential of the story disappears. Not too many minor characters besides Rem and Shera earlier. The minor cast is more forced in the end so I think this show is just too pushy. Alicia Cristela is a character that is too forced at the end so that her development isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t too visible. Edelgard also like that. Even the antagonist is unmemorable. Likewise with all the characters.\n\nWhile I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m quite love \u00e2\u0080\u009cIzetta: The Last Witch\u00e2\u0080\u009d besides this show also loses its potential and quite forgettable for people, Ajia-Do works on both but only a few TV anime. The animation is so Isekai-like. The fantasy element is average and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t raise many expectations. The action is bland and solid. The fanservice? Just your cakes. The design of the character is just your typical mainstream. There is Shera with her \u00e2\u0080\u009cbig\u00e2\u0080\u009d body and Rem as your loli. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just put you into shame. The voice actor is great. Thanks to their talents who fill all kinds of roles. And thank you with the fanservice too. I use it for reference. There is no other reason.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow Not to Summon a Demon Lord\u00e2\u0080\u009d just your typical escapism, harem thing, and overpowered anime. This main trio came to introduce you to a world of adventures full of\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 pointless things. But, this anime is at least quite enjoyable if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think too much about it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to turn your brain off. Generic characters, bland actions, average soundtracks, average animations as well, and decent voice actors. Just take it easy for anime like this if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think too much about it."}, {"id": 3853, "score": 50, "body": "Ghost in the Shell has always been a series that I love and enjoy watching the various movies and tv shows based in the universe. And with the announcement of a Netflix Ghost in the Shell, I figured I should finally get around to finishing up the rest of the existing tv shows and movies at the least. But Arise: Border 1 Ghost Pain just wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a Ghost in the Shell movie remotely close to what I would want and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enjoy in the least. Instead I got more explosions and fight scenes, alongside fast paced story telling that ends up being severely lacking in many aspects. \n\nThe story seems like it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do anything new or expand on the characters at all. Somebody ends up dead so Major must investigate the murder and solve the crime. Along the way she ends up questioning who she is and what is real. Except the pacing of this investigation is so quick it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have enough time to breath and ask any questions. So, it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so much as an investigation, as going from one set-piece to another in order to get some scene or fight in. I never got a feeling that Major was using her \u00e2\u0080\u009cwizard\u00e2\u0080\u009d level hacking skills to uncover some massive piece of the puzzle and put the murder together or working with other people around her to lead her to the solution. Instead it feels like she just happens to put things together without warning or explanation until the final scene when it all gets explained. None of which ends up feeling deserved or hard fought for, it is just feels handed to us.\n\nThe characters beside Major are essentially non-existent. Major is the main focus of the movie completely, and a main plot point revolves around her and her cybernetics. And once again the question of what is real and what isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shows up again in this movie, but it is never explored or questioned. And Major never really has a questioning her humanity moment like she has had in the past, no brilliant diving scene in this movie. Her character design also got a major change which I feel like is the biggest issue with her character really. I can understand changing a character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s backstory and putting the movie in an alternate universe to give everyone more space to work with. So, while I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m annoyed at the changes they made to her backstory, I can accept it and ignore them. What I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like are the changes they made that end up having her character look like a 16-year-old. In 3 years, she ends up being this rather badass looking character with an amazing design. But in these movies, she has none of those features that she has in Stand Alone Complex, and instead she looks like a young teenager who looks out of place. It would work better if they had set it farther back in time, but as it is it looks disjointed if your used to the way she looks in essentially everything else. \n\nMinor touch on the way the movie looks, well I guess it looks bland and kinda boring. It didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any moments of camera pan that make me stop and say\u00e2\u0080\u00a6Wow. Instead it looks kinda like a generic futuristic city without anything special. Just another disappointing downgrade from everything in the previous shows and movies. \n\nTo finish this up, I would say that unless you are a fan of Ghost in the Shell like I am. And just want to finish up the video content to say you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen it all, I would go watch a better movie. Cause this doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have anything impressive or interesting when compared to the previous entries. \n"}, {"id": 3854, "score": 50, "body": "My main gripe with Toradora and the underlying issue driving my frustration is the weak and unconvincing motivations, personalities, and relationship dynamics, which make the characters feel empty and shallow with little meaning to back up their actions. The plot depends on you believing and justifying the actions of these characters in order to move forward, but it is difficult to become invested if you do not believe that they are genuine or realistic. It is greatly exacerbated by the fact that reactions and displays of emotions are so overemphasized and overstated. This can be great if the intentions and the reasoning are reasonable and funny, and as a side plot or comedic relief, but in TD it is way too overused and is one of the only things moving the plot forward. It also takes everyone forever to accomplish anything meaningful, because no one is forward or open with their desires despite very, VERY obviously showing them. \n\nAll of these factors make it feel as if their resulting illogical and irrational decisions are solely used to create drama for the sake of creating drama, instead of depicting a more natural progression of events and obstacles. Simple problems, that have simple solutions that should be as obvious as the sun is bright, are dragged out for hours thereby resulting in a plot that barely goes anywhere for well into two-thirds in. By that point, where the plot finally starts seeing some progress, it is hard to have any stake in the outcome as any credibility to the realism of the character relationships has been destroyed. The rest of the show feels rushed and speeds through finally progressing on a relationship on which the foundation is shaky and unconvincing. \n\nI honestly do not understand why this show is so highly rated. There are a few good moments scattered throughout, but every single character except Ami (who is the exception to most of what I said in this opening) is irredeemable and undeserving of a happy ending. Spoilers from here on out.\n______________________________________________________\n\nSo let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start with __Taiga and Ryuuji__. First is the fact that their relationship is built upon their desires for other people; which, in the case of both crushes, are poorly defined and justified from the beginning. However, this is definitely not my main complaint with their dynamic. Ryuuji is a complete doormat to Taiga and her verbal and physical abuse, and selfish, ungrateful, conceited, and downright nasty attitude. A little masochism in small doses can be great. However, there is absolutely no logical reason for Ryuuji to put up with it for that long as it would reasonably drive anyone away, and it is also way too overplayed. It may be funny the first few times, but it relentlessly drags on well into +16 episodes. And sure there are people who love cooking and cleaning for other people, but the level Ryuuji takes it to is absurd. I guess what makes their relationship insufferable for me is that I don't enjoy the quirkiness or the eccentricity of these characteristics because they're just not convincing for me. Taiga reciprocates nothing, it is a completely one way relationship. The reasons that have been explained to me of why Ryuuji likes Taiga, such as understanding, compassion, and someone to vent and act natural to around, are not only not believable, but can also be said about Minori and Ami. I can understand that others may enjoy or even relate to Taiga and Ryuuji\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship, but I find it way too unrealistic and frustrating. This is the underlying problem I have with TD. It just falls apart if you do not find the main relationship of the plot to be believable from start to finish, since everything revolves around and is built upon it. \n\nSo now onto __Kitamura__, who is honestly pathetic. He spends a few episodes brooding and running away from an extremely simple problem in the most pathetic way possible. We later find out that it was all a pitiful stunt to try and win over the sitting student council president. A cry for help should not drive the plot of over 40 minutes of screen time. Again, completely unconvincing motivation since we have very little backstory and reason for why we should be invested in his crush, and absurd over personification and overreaction. While this arc of his is more of a side story and easy to separate from the main plot, it does become the motivating factor or foundation for many of the events between Ryuuji and Taiga. This adds another layer of unconvincing motivation which makes everything that follows that much harder to believe and justify. Back to the story; so now this goes back to Taiga who finally realizes that the guy she has been creaming herself over for the past +16 episodes loves someone else and not her - something that a chimp would be able to deduce after his repeated ignoring of her being publicly aroused to the point of near aneurysm. After about 6 whole hours of this extremely frustrating and largely stagnant plot, she realizes that Ryuuji is the one she loves. How convenient and lazy of a motivation is that? Sure Taiga may have seen Ryuuji as a father figure before this, but that's a thin wall to hide behind considering the little amount of time it takes for her to change her view. The quickness of it (especially compared to how long and drawn out the plot was before this point) makes it seem forced and not very natural or realistic of a progression at all. And the kicker is, Ryuuji welcomes it even after the downright abuse, ungratefulness, and contempt that Taiga has inflicted upon him relentlessly. Repeating what I said before, just seems ridiculous that the ending and payoff of the show depends on you believing in the validity of their initial relationship.\n\nBut the main conflict of the show is that Ryuuji likes __Minori__ and now she starts to like him back - a bit before Taiga but at around the same time regardless. This is more than 15 episodes in, where before it was long and dragged out line of X loves Y who loves Z who loves etc. Within that time by the way, the whole plot could have been easily solved if someone actually said something, ANYTHING. So much time spent on nothing, driven by everyone not wanting to say anything but showing it so obviously that it numbs the brain how it goes unresolved. So anyways, now we actually have a love triangle and Minori also starts liking Ryuuji, but the problem is that Minori is extremely loyal, obedient, and submissive to Taiga. Trying to pass this dynamic off as believable is another aspect that the plot is hinging on in order to move forward, and is the main focus of my frustration with Minori. Again, extremely unconvincing motivation and reasoning behind it. Taiga deserves basically none of the affection she gets, both from Minori and from Ryuuji. Oh boo hoo her dad is rich and pays for all her shit which she, by putting in the slightest amount of effort towards, could live a wonderful life. Father not around? Neither is Ryuuji's. Got family issues? So does literally every single one of the 5 main characters to varying degrees.\n\nSo now we get to __Ami__, the only redeemable character. She makes decisions that for the most part make sense, has a great character arc, and reasonable, well explained plot development that adds substantial depth to her character and is not just used for a plot device. She seems to be the only one of the group who has eyes and uses them to perceive the world around her. The only one who actually confronts people and talks about things, trying to take action to accomplish what she or the people around her wants - to no avail thanks to the denseness of everyone else. The only who does not let their blinding emotional desires overpower simple decision making. The only one who calls out the sheer stupidity of the conflicts stemming from the emotional attractions within the group, which are poorly defined but are the only things driving the plot forward. Sure she starts out as a terrible person, but literally the next episode her entire motivation and backstory is explained in a way that makes sense and explains her behavior, and she pretty much stops being such a terrible person. Her attraction to the MC is one that grows over time instead of a blinding love seemingly popping into existence at just the right time to move the plot along.\n_____________________________________\n\nNot everyone needs a happy ending - I am perfectly fine with that. However, Taiga definitely does not deserve one being the terrible person that she is, especially at the expense of both Minori and Ami. They are much better and more redeemable characters whose motivations and decisions are more reasonable, and whose attraction to the MC is much more believable and convincing. I realize now after having it explained to me, that the last few episodes with the eloping (as weird as they were) do show Taiga's arc and ultimate motivations. I will admit that it does make some sense, but I still have issues with the show. It is such a departure from her personality and her behavior from the previous +20 episodes, and feels extremely rushed compared to slow and stagnant progression up until that point. \n\nThe ending, actually the entire show really but the ending to a greater extent, requires big jumps in logic and assumptions to be made; putting trust in both the changing and unchanging motivations of the characters that I personally like seeing instead of believing. A fitting end, where the outcome relies on superimposing your personal belief that these characters have grown and progressed. Making the assumption that you will just believe it and go along with it without showing the effort and the self reflection that relationships take, instead opting for derivative, trumped up drama and showing you the result, hoping that you will fill in the gaps yourself and believe it to be convincing. While I can understand some of the appeal in that, in my opinion; the situations and character personalities presented compared to the outcomes of the plot are just too big of gaps to fill in."}, {"id": 3857, "score": 68, "body": "~~~img600(https://i.imgur.com/NQhOYH3.jpg)~~~\n# ~~~__Spoiler-free review__~~~\n<n></n>\n# Review in brief:\n\nClannad, especially in this first season, is a free-spirited, slow-burning, and ultimately romantic slice-of-life.  It is a mish-mash of whimsical, childish humors and melodramatic, yet sometimes ethereal reflections & revelations.  While it is overly immature at times and is overall lacking in substance & consistency, it has one aspect that allows the whole season to resonate when viewed under the right lens; that it is wholly emblematic of the end of adolescence.\n\n# Review part I ~ the underlying story:\n\nThis is a difficult season of anime to separate from its series to discuss standalone.  The standard visual novel adaptation setup and abundance of common rom-com tropes don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make it clear what Clannad is or where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going.  Clannad is so named due to a misunderstanding about the Gaelic word for family, but much of this season focuses on high-school events.  The series as a whole is known and often judged by its reputation as the poster-child of \u00e2\u0080\u009canime that will make you cry\u00e2\u0080\u009d, but many will find this season\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heaviest moments to be melancholic at most.\n\nBefore getting into the meat of this anime, one must leave their pre-conceived notions at the door.  Strangely fitting as it is, this is a teenage Clannad on display.  It struggles with self-reliance and often fails to heed the criticisms surrounding its ilk.  Yet the patient and caring observer will be able to see that it is isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t done preparing itself for that fateful first step out the door and that its strengths, though not fully realized, see it capable of admirable deeds in the right circumstances.  All of this is readily apparent right out the gate in the first episode\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first scene.\n\n~~~img600(https://i.imgur.com/6zWdn99.jpg)\n_\"Oh wow, how many other times has this type of anime started with the sak-\" just be quiet and soak it in a little, okay?_~~~\n\nClannad opens with its protagonist, the troubled delinquent Tomoya Okazaki, at the bottom of the hill his high-school sits atop.  He despises his lot in life, and is convinced he has good reasons to feel that way.  At the foot of the hill stands another student, Nagisa Furukawa, and her optimistic yet uncertain demeanor plays an odd contrast to Tomoya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assured negativity.  Nagisa suddenly exclaims her favorite food of all things, sparking a brief conversation that Tomoya passes off as inconsequential as he begins climbing the hill.\n\nNow a critical thinker who is versed in this medium and its genres will see ample reasons to say \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen this countless times before\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI bet he meets the tsundere next\u00e2\u0080\u009d, or perhaps \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey should have just called this Kanon II\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  They truly can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be blamed either; these are indeed all valid responses to an opening as standard as this.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an unfortunate truth, as in this scene also resides the very spirit that comes to define Clannad.  It can be seen in Nagisa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s silly introductory line inciting enough curiosity to get Tomoya to listen further.  It can be seen in Tomoya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assuredness being given to Nagisa in response despite his negativity.  It can be seen in the very hill the scene takes place on, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just a part of the school or even just the town, but a part of life, one that Tomoya has unwittingly began climbing.  All of that is thematically referenced throughout the series.  Though it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to tell from the get-go, there is an underlying yet overarching story layered within the otherwise typical high-school + supernatural shenanigans Jun Maeda is known for.\n\nThis persistent usage of typical & expected events as a vehicle to deliver deeper connected meanings is both Clannad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s greatest strength and biggest weakness.  Not many of these events are as layered and few still are as important as the scene at the foot of the hill, but a lot of Clannad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scenes, despite how uninspired they may appear on the surface, often carry a piece of the underlying story that ties the romance, drama, and childish comedy together.  The supernatural elements of the story often act as the visible strands, especially the \u00e2\u0080\u009cillusionary world\u00e2\u0080\u009d that seems to represent occasional dreams yet seeps its way into surface-level events.  It all makes Clannad accessible to younger viewers without _necessarily_ being too shallow and pointless for a more mature audience.  However, the overarching story encompasses the whole of Clannad, not just this season, so the viewer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focus will tend to be set more on the standard high-school rom-com on the surface than the layered and slightly supernatural drama that only begins here.\n\n~~~img(https://i.imgur.com/B4IJM3R.gif)\n_The story of the illusionary world only begins here, but it's connected to the surface-level story both subtly & directly as this season goes on._~~~\n\n# Review part II ~ the surface story:\n\nAs I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve implied thus far, the surface-level story is childish, clunky, and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell much that hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been told better elsewhere.  It follows Tomoya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interactions with a standard harem\u00e2\u0080\u0099s variety of girls as he helps sort out their problems and gets to know more about them in turn.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a setup that heavily relies on characters to make a worthwhile experience, and Clannad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cast is not properly balanced for this.  Tomoya himself is a fairly competent individual whose strengths and flaws often come into play as he goes through each arc (though his development is rather light in this season).  The side cast has a number of effective foils for Tomoya and the main girls (like Nagisa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father Akio who is always putting on acts and Tomoya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friend Sunohara whose loud and careless demeanor gets him in frequent trouble) who occasionally give the anime a quirky charm.\n\nUnfortunately, Clannad fumbles the handling of its main girls, which is where a lot of its problems truly lie.  The common complaint is that the majority of them act more like children than budding adults.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something that the characters in question have reasons for inside the story, but nonetheless severely hampers their development and ultimately the quality of their surface-story arcs.  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Nagisa (whose _mystery illness_ plays a role in her arrested social development), Kotomi (the quiet autistic savant; not that she displays a whole lot of intelligence in the story, but she certainly displays a complete lack of social skills), and Fuuko (basically a loud Kotomi with an obsession towards starfish and no claimed savantism.  Her actual reason for being childish is a spoiler).\n\nNagisa does get enough development to be tolerable thanks to having her arc come later and from her more central story role as the heart of the drama club used to connect the story segments.  However, the early arcs of Fuuko & Kotomi do nothing to make them hold any purpose beyond being shallow copies of previous Key characters.  Those of you who have seen Kanon probably already know which characters they're copies of, and their arcs are copied almost as much (the differences being that all that made those two characters in Kanon meaningful is torn out and forgotten).  For those of you who have seen Air, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to get back with you after I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen it.  With arcs that are mostly inferior recycled versions of previous Key arcs that only have Clannad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s underlying story to keep things interesting (unless melodrama, meme pranks, and repeat jokes can hold you over) there is no consequential rebuttal for the criticisms leveled against these characters.\n\n~~~img(https://i.imgur.com/Qf2hrPm.gif)\n<i>\"Genius\" at work.  Clannad features only the </i>freshest<i> jokes on repeat.</i>~~~\n\nSpeaking of the comedy, the majority of it comes off as shallow filler, especially when it comes to padding out Fuuko & Kotomi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arcs.  While some of it can be quirky depending on what characters are involved, much of it amounts to childish teasing and memery.  Simple humor for simple minds essentially.  The real issue is that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more of it early on than later, so while Fuuko & Kotomi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arcs get enough time to have made substantial surface-level developments, too much time ends up getting spent on cheap humor for that to happen.\n\nAfter those two drawn-out arcs, the next arc does the opposite and crams two main girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (three if you count Ryou as a main girl, though the attention she gets is lacking enough to make this debatable) development into a shorter arc than the last two.  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plenty of indications that Kyou & Tomoyo have more character than is initially presented, but little of it is delved into.  Even the OVAs these characters received later don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fully patch the holes this season makes in their development.  This leaves the last arc (Nagisa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s) as the only arc where the pacing works.  For what her rather standard dandere character is worth, she gets enough serious moments (including more that tie into the underlying story) to at least make her arc better than the others.  So long as Nagisa herself doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bug you it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely to be the best part of the season.\n\n# Review part III ~ all in all:\n\nSo in the end, what this season has to offer plot-wise is the beginning of a supernatural drama which is tied into a poorly-paced and overall shallow high-school rom-com (until the last arc anyhow).  However, before reaching a conclusion there is a need to discuss the production values, which as has come to be expected from Kyoto Animation is top-notch for the late 2000\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and holds up strong today.\n\nWhile Key\u00e2\u0080\u0099s huge-eyed character art style isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite seamlessly integrated in this season, the overall picture quality is high and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of smooth animation in place, especially for a story sourced from a visual novel.  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also an impressive amount of detail put into the background art, which combined with the skilled use of filters allows the visuals alone to instantly set the mood, something the poorly paced story ends up relying on.  The \u00e2\u0080\u009cillusionary world\u00e2\u0080\u009d scenes are particularly well made.  The completely hand-drawn girl in the mostly CG world works astonishingly well, and the CG designs are so fitting that they hardly feel dated more than 10 years later.\n\n~~~img(https://i.imgur.com/F6UBIHM.gif)\n_At least the constantly repeated gags get some good animation._~~~\n\nEver better than the visuals is the sound quality.  In the Japanese dub, the skilled voicework gives the characters a more down-to-earth vibe than the silly comedy and abundance of melodrama would typically allow, which goes a long way in keeping things grounded enough for the underlying story to matter when it comes in between the surface shenanigans.  As for the music, well, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just say I respect Jun Maeda much more as a composer than as a writer.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surprising how easily his music can instantly create a mood, even when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as simplistic as Clannad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soundtrack.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been said that perfection is when there is nothing left to take away, and while I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not the sort to throw that word around lightly there is so little that could be removed from Clannad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pieces that the aforementioned saying instantly comes to mind when I listen to one of them.\n\nSo, with all of that said and done, is Clannad worth your time?  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always a tough call when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m asked this, but the biggest decider is typically how patient the asker is.  As cheesy of a rom-com as Clannad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first season is, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just a rom-com when you step back.  Much like how the end of a budding adult\u00e2\u0080\u0099s education makes for a beginning more than it does an end, Clannad is only getting started here.  This is not the end of yet another melodramatic romance, but the beginning of something far grander, the likes of which rarely show up in this medium or any other.  While the stale exterior is not excusable, the story\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core does add a considerable value to the experience even before it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been fully developed.  It still is able to make some otherwise melodramatic moments work even if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t connect with the characters and even makes some of the jokes ring clearer.\n\nClannad is not a fair-weather friend; it needs to be tolerated through thick and thin to be truly appreciated.  Perhaps that description doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sound very inviting for an _anime_, something often seen as entertainment first and foremost, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not supposed to be.  Even so, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve read this far and haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t experienced Clannad for yourself it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hurt much to try out an episode or two.  It won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take long to figure out if you can tolerate Clannad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s faults or not.  If you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no harm in leaving it be and moving on, as skipping to After Story doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even get you all the way past the story\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shakier portion and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have missed too much to understand what makes the actual After Story what it is.  If you _can_, however, you could easily find something so special that it changes your outlook on life.\n"}, {"id": 3859, "score": 60, "body": "WRITER\u00e2\u0080\u0099S NOTE: *SPOILERS* This review assumes that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen Ghost In the Shell(1995), as it simply focuses on the changes between the original film and this version.\n\nGhost in the Shell 2.0 is to Ghost in the Shell what the Special Editions are to Star Wars, and while GitS 2.0 is nowhere nearly as egregious as the Special Editions, it still feels like a pointless exercise in updating a previous work.\n\nGitS 2.0 was released in 2008 in celebration for the release of The Sky Crawlers in theatres that same year, as a way for it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s director, Memoru Oshii, and studio Production I.G. to cross promote both projects. The intention of 2.0 was to \u00e2\u0080\u009cremaster\u00e2\u0080\u009d the original film in away, but it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really feel like a remaster, it feels like a project intended to make money of an established franchise. And what we got was a weird mix of 2D animation from 1995 mixed with 13 years worth of advancement in CGI attached to a film never intended to have it in the first place.\n\nThe main difference between Gits 2.0 and The Sky Crawlers, besides the obvious subject matter and presentation, is that The Sky Crawlers was planned from the start to have CGI integrated with the 2D animation, and as a result, the mix between the CGI and the 2D animation for that movie mesh a lot better in that film.\n\nThe biggest and most obvious change in 2.0 is that a few scenes have been replaced with fully 3D animated versions of those scenes. These new scenes conflict with the original, not only because the switch between the 3D and 2Dcan be a bit jarring, but the 3D is presented in a different style to the 2D. This wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have been so bad if it weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for the conflicting film making styles between the 2D and the 3D.\n\nThe original film is almost entirely simple static shots, while the 3D animation has sweeping camera shots that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fit the style of the original at all, simply because the 2D animation wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t capable of these shots. The film was working with what it could the time it was released. It just feels weird going from smooth flowing movements with the CGI, to all of a sudden staring at a static couple of characters talking or plot happening.\n\nThere are several other shots throughout the film that have had parts of them replaced with CGI, such as aircraft or certain background features like an aquarium. I guess these were used to heighten scenes, but like I said before, the original Ghost in the Shell film was never meant to have CGI, so it just feels out of place.\n\nI wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t call the CGI awful, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely just OK. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty clear the team behind the CGI added shaders onto it to try and give it a bit of a 2D feel, trying to wash out any detail the 3D models had, but it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help. A minor nitpick i have is the difference between look of the digital picture. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t match the grainy filmic look of the original footage. That sounds like a weird complaint, but it just shows the difference between something made in a computer and something made in an analog format by human hands (ironic).\n\nThe only change that i thought looked good were the holograms throughout the film being replaced with the CGI. They were the only things in the original meant to look digital to begin with, so the replacement CGI is the least intrusive CGI in the whole thing.\n\nAnother minor grievance I have is the framerate difference between the 2D animation and the 3D animation. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just another reason on the pile of reasons that mixing the 2D animation and the 3D animation wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that good of an idea.\n\nEverything else that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t completely replaced with the CGI has also been modified to varying degrees. Every shot of the film has been tinted with a warm orange color, with varying intensity. Some shots it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s barely noticeable, and in some shots, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overpowering to the point of washing out a few scenes. It completely ruins the cold clinical blue look that the original film was going for, that was supposed to help heighten the sense of some characters losing their identities and becoming more robotic with how modified their bodies were. I assume it the color tinting was to help the older 2D animated scenes match the new CGI, but it just ruins the stylistic choices the original had.\n\nThe weirdest thing about this new version is the way it was re-edited. Several scenes have been changed, and there doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to be a reason why. All of the edits are simple trims, cutting anything from a couple of frames to about a second of time off at most. But the fact that these edits were made make no sense. They add literally nothing to the whole experience. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if it was done to make the whole experience feel different or was done just to make a change for changes sake, but it just felt unnecessary.\n\nThe other obvious and significant change is the new audio mix. The original soundtrack was re-arranged and re-recorded, and the whole thing was remixed into 6.1Channel Surround, done by Randy Thom over at Skywalker Sound,previously working on Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence. For the most part, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really have any problems with this. A lot of the new sound effects are not terrible, but nothing to complain about.\n\nAlong with the remixed audio, the Japanese voices were also re-recorded to try and modernize the dialogue. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t speak Japanese, but from what I can tell compared to a decent amount of Japanese performances that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard throughout the years, the performances are fine. The biggest change is that the original voice of The Puppet Master, played by Iemasa Kayumi, the male voice, was replaced by Yoshiko Sakakibara, a now female voice. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily a bad choice, but it feels like another change in a long list of unnecessary changes.\n\nI could see the argument that since it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a robot intended to be female, it would have a female voice, but then why does the Major\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice change back to her previous voice at the end of movie when she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in a new body? And since the new sentient AI was born in the sea of information, it would either go with whatever voice it happened to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cborn\u00e2\u0080\u009dwith or pick something that represented itself.\n\nI have no idea if this change was done with some sort of intent, but considering how many weird changes that 2.0 gets seemingly without much thought, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be surprised if there was any intent in the change of voice besides changing something for the sake of it, like maybe a perceived error in casting a male voice.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, this whole 2.0 experiment feels a little pointless. If the entire film was redone as CGI, it would have at least been consistent in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality. It still might have been a pointless shot-for-shot remake, but it would have felt less intrusive. But instead, what we got was a mixed bag in terms of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cremaster\u00e2\u0080\u009d. None of the changes feel like they enough of a change to justify their existence.\n\nBest case scenario,Ghost in the Shell 2.0 is a companion piece to the original and is for fans only. Worst case, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entirely skippable, but doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly ruin the film. I have a hard time recommending this when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incredibly easy to find and watch the original version of GitS over 2.0. The only people who would be interested in this version of the film would be fans of the original version anyway, and those are the people who would complain about this the loudest. And this version is not exactly a good way to introduce more people to a classic movie like this."}, {"id": 3861, "score": 50, "body": "The second movie in the Ghost in the Shell Arise series, and I think this one gave up on the whole philosophical aspect of Ghost in the Shell completely. I honestly don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember a single moment of this movie that made a person question what was occurring, or their feelings on a matter. Instead I feel like we got a rehash of the first movie, with the plot driven by some rather similar things that we have seen in the past. Incorrect memories, super powerful chips, and AI. All these plot points have occurred in the past Ghost in the Shell shows or movies and have always been done better in those past versions. So, it just leads to disappointment when stuff occurs with little build-up or suspense, and you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but compare it to those other shows and movies. \n\nThis movie also has a disappointing visual style that is unimpressive. The characters still don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look good or interesting, just kinda bland. And that carries over to the general feel of the city that they spend a bunch of time driving around. We get lots of boring shots of cars driving on generic raised highways, without any stunning visuals. I feel sad knowing that none of these movies come close to the show, and instead keep the generic anime feel. \n\nThe character development in this movie was essentially nonexistent, and all they did was introduce us to some new characters and some backstory. It would have hoped for a bit more development from most of the characters, given we are on the second of four movies and we barely know or care at all about the characters. \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tMajor went from place to place shooting up stuff and caused explosions. And her total character growth came to her finally deciding to put together the team and working independent. \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tThe second lead VV has a sudden surprise twist in the last fight. But unlike the other times we have had this surprise twist, this one had no build up and wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hinted at. So, you had no way of guessing who this character was. \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tSaito is introduced with the barest character possible. Here is some sniper who likes to gamble and has money issues. \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tPazu gets literally nothing in this movie at all. He just kinda exists and joins Major\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team because he wanted to join. \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tIshikawa also literally just exists, has 3 scenes or so, and does very little. Might as well not have existed in this movie at all. \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tBatou gets the bad guy spot in this movie. But his motivations besides wanting to help his superior Soga with his plan. \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tThe final bad guy would be Soga, the superior of various people. And the person we are told is the mastermind of the project for most of the movie. And given the larger plot that was mentioned in a single line is never explored, he might as well have been the only mastermind. \n\nOverall, I get the feeling with this movie as well, that they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to make a Ghost in the Shell movie. They wanted to make a generic action movie, but needed a world to place it in. And decided that since people like Ghost in the Shell, they can use the name to drive up interest in it. Watching it, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel any real love for the series or previous installments.  \n"}, {"id": 3862, "score": 50, "body": "Five men, all considered some of the most violent and dangerous criminals in the world await death row. Each one locked in high-security prisons across several continents unbeknownst to each other and, as if by sheer coincidence, break out from their penitentiaries and head for Tokyo Japan. Their goal: to challenge the fighting champion of the underground Baki Hanma in the hopes of finally tasting defeat.\n\nBaki is somewhat of an anomaly when talking about the series in depth. On the surface Baki comes across as the stereotypical shounen following a teenage boy training to become the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strongest fighter, a label currently held by his father Yujiro Hanma. However, when delving deeper into the story, Baki manages to encapsulate the concept of fighting and the themes that tie with such. The struggles, sacrifices and suffering felt when facing an almost unachievable goal, the unbridled enjoyment of experiencing your passion to the fullest and even the jaded, dreary perception that can set in when constantly at the pinnacle of one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s field of interest \u00e2\u0080\u0093 all are just some of the core ideas the series is firmly rooted in and all remain prevalent in this adaptation of Baki.\n\nThis version is set shortly after the Maximum Tournament arc, acting as a direct continuation to the past TV adaptations of Baki almost 2 decades ago, but still serves a solid entry point for newcomers of the franchise. The first OP gives enough backstory on its own \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Baki wins a fighting tournament and is crowned the world champion, but that title behaves more like a proverbial target on his back, attracting the group of convicts whose unmatched strength had led each to grow bored of life and now seek to challenge the young prodigy. This premise eventually leading to a showdown between the death row inmates and Baki alongside other underground martial artists prominent in past seasons; a 5-on-5 no holds barred match where fights are free to run amok between fighters anytime and anyplace, which would also soon involve various other characters in this battle between discipline and technique against sheer brutality and ability. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an arc that easily creates excitement and anticipation as to how such a story will play out, but the execution of this turns out to be a mixed bag depending on your expectations for the anime.\n\nThe plot for this arc, while it may seem grand on paper is actually fairly simplistic; progression and development are both dependent on fights between martial artists with at least one character gaining something from each encounter, from a newfound strategy to beat an opponent if they ever fight again to realizing weaknesses that keep themselves from becoming stronger. One would think this approach would make each fight more meaningful and hold more weight, except that when reflecting back most fights in this show came off forgettable and even sporadic, the latter being the result of very poor structure and pacing. Baki has a habit of introducing new characters and flashbacks at random points in the story, with some flashbacks being as long as 10 minutes in the middle of a match. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a habit that seriously disengages the viewer from the tension and unpredictability that this arc is founded upon, to an unpardonable extent with how often this is bound to happen. This kind of storyboarding is what constantly brings down my engrossment of the narrative here as it continues onward, meanwhile the eventual outcome of this arc is seriously underwhelming given how each of the five criminals are written off so unevenly. The lack of a succinct structure results in some antagonists being beaten in quick fashion in order to build towards the next arc of Baki and thus required bringing past characters back into the mix to do just that. Narratively, it looked to be full of ideas and potential develop but lacked a clear direction and framework to present the arc in a carefully planned and orderly manner.\n\nThe characterization in Baki is also lacklustre to an extent. Characters in Baki can often be considered embodiments of their chosen martial arts style, with the values and overarching philosophy of each forging the minds, bodies and souls of their practitioners. Through this understanding the show probably appears to be stacked with many distinct personalities to play with at the writer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leisure, yet it remains difficult for many to leave a strong impression on the audience. Partly due to awkward plotting as stated earlier, but also most characters lack in enough focus and development to keep most characters important. The events are often made out as more vital than the characters taking part in such. This leads to not only a declining interest in the fights as the series continues, but also makes the majority of characters used here more likely to be lost in the shuffle and only used when convenient.\n\nBaki as a whole has always been primarily about Baki Hanma, the protagonist, and his father Yujiro, the strongest creature on Earth both feared and respected by all. These two are constantly integral parts to the overall story as they should be, yet to witness so many side characters be treated so sparingly can be disheartening to say the least. However, my biggest problem with this adaptation when it comes to characters is with its handling of the main character Baki Hanma. This is a problem that I feel is more prominent to those who have followed the series from the beginning and have seen Baki grow from the hot-headed impulsive gifted brat to an exceptional fighter worthy of being called a champion. But in this arc, Baki appears\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. different. Not only is his personality more laid-back but his train of thought and subsequent actions at times come off somewhat autistic. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a take on the character that I had never envisioned or pictured, not only acting as the cause for several awkward moments, but also frankly feeling like a betrayal of the character that I remembered watching and reading. Baki still receives his own development throughout this arc, moving from a reserved anxious style of fight to the spirited, confident attitude that made him such a force to be reckoned with. Except for when you find out this change and increase of strength is solely due to Baki losing his virginity.\n\nI wish I was making that up.\n\nIf you were to read Baki in its manga counterpart, one of the first aspects that would catch your eye would be the art-style. There is a keen eye for detail in not only making each technique such a crucial part of the series, but in making the character designs such exaggerated portraits of strength in the human anatomy. A clear expression of weight and power through this absurdist aesthetic creates a strangely beautiful sense of art that further pushes Baki from the standard shounen manga series. However, if one were to watch this version of Baki, the visuals would easily be the first part that grabs your attention. But unfortunately, the visuals here are kind of trash. It is certainly an improvement from previous installments, but comparing it to the quality of its contemporaries, this has so many glaring issues. Designs have a habit of appearing out of perspective on different angles, animation for the most part is cheap and the juxtaposition of 2D and 3D animation is so god awful it is near impossible for viewers to take most fights seriously. It also doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help that the fight choreography makes the battles come across more turn-based than a Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon game. For one of the most jarring experiences I have ever had for watching an anime. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m honestly surprised how I can say a show with so many technical issues can still be tolerable, but here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the crazy thing: I actually enjoyed the show.\n\nEarlier I called Baki an anomaly, and this entry in the franchise is no different. Baki (2018) is honestly an insane show that should not be so enjoyable to watch, from both faults in production and writing. But here we are, with a series seemingly unbridled in taking action and martial arts to the irrational, all whilst taking itself absolutely seriously. This level of sincerity is almost palpable through every episode and makes it difficult not getting drawn into the bizarre logic of Baki, no matter how grating the lack of fluid animation and coherent writing may get. In this arc, Baki takes the leap of embracing its own ridiculousness to evolve into a genuine spectacle for the eyes that is hard to not take notice of, and with the finale acting as a teaser to a possible continuation of the story, I expect that the best of Baki is still yet to come."}, {"id": 3874, "score": 66, "body": "_\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe very definitely told your father there's a chance \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a very great chance, he said \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that Seymour may completely lose control of himself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 J.D. Salinger._\n\nA soldier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life is one of hardships. Seen as the pride of a nation, they are tasked with defending the honour of their motherland with both flesh and blood. A life that requires chivalry, discipline and steadfastness. Their existence serves as a beacon light to the tame and cowardly; a source of inspiration for the youth to grow strong. But underneath all the glory and medallions reveal a darker tale more telling of their lives. Ordinary people before donning a uniform and sent off to war, a life of violence and suffering entails them. A hellish nightmare seeming to never end makes it near impossible to return to their former self. One must be physically and mentally tough to ever hope to survive such a turbulent time, but not everyone is capable of carrying that weight.\n\nJ.D. Salinger was one writer who certainly understood the pressures put upon people in severe circumstances such as war, through first-hand experience being drafted into the US army in 1942, even being hospitalized by \u00e2\u0080\u0098combat stress reaction\u00e2\u0080\u0099 months after Germany was defeated in World War II. He was clearly affected, going so far as stating \u00e2\u0080\u009c[he] found it impossible to fit into a society that ignored the truth that he now knew.\u00e2\u0080\u009d These events all informed his writing of the short story titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cA Perfect Day for Bananafish\u00e2\u0080\u009d. While numerous interpretations of the story do exist, the common belief is that it symbolizes those soldiers sent off to war and came back traumatized; gorged by the anguish brought on from war and stained of bloodshed. Decades later this short story would be loosely referenced to in the successful shoujo manga series Banana Fish, written and illustrated by Akimi Yoshida that would later be considered highly influential to the BL subgenre. And now over 20 years since the manga\u00e2\u0080\u0099s initial release, Banana Fish received an anime adaptation produced courtesy by Studio MAPPA to run for 24 episodes in the latter half of 2018.\n\nBanana Fish focuses on the relationship between Ash Lynx, a cold ruthless teenage gang leader in New York City, and a na\u00c3\u00afve assistant photographer from Japan in Eiji Okumura. Both men, despite appearing as polar opposites in personality and upbringing end up being caught in a fallout over an entity known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cBanana Fish\u00e2\u0080\u009d, that also happens to be related to Ash\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brother and what occurred on his stint in Iraq. The pursuit of this mystery further pulls Eiji to the centre of this conflict, thereby leading to Ash pushing against the wishes of his bosses and gang members who put the safety of his newfound friend in jeopardy. It would be easy to summarize the story as simply a developing romance between two men, but the series is more concerned in making the story and overarching weight of it at the forefront of the tale, causing the narrative, despite being heavily reliant on genre tropes, works effectively as a fast-paced charming thriller. The series uses heavy topics regarding drugs, sexual abuse, corruption and other mature themes to craft a careful drama that avoids sensationalizing the sheer brutality inherent with such subject matter. Likewise, these ideas further accentuate the thematic correlation between Salinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cA Perfect Day for Bananafish\u00e2\u0080\u009d and this loosely inspired adaptation.\n\nNo other character is as carefully crafted nor developed to the same degree as the main protagonist Ash Lynx. His backstory alone would be enough to garner the sympathy of many: a boy who ran away from home at 8 years old only to be taken into custody by the head of the Mafia. Having been kidnapped as a sex slave numerous times later before being granted leadership of a street gang years later, he has seen his fair share of violence and trauma. Part of his likability derives from him never seeing himself as a victim and therefore is able to overcome adversity. However, his meeting of Eiji is what ultimately acts as the cause for Ash to slowly reveal himself emotionally and properly recover from trauma accumulated throughout the years. His character easily parallels that of Salinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s protagonist, as someone who has been exposed to so much that the idea of recovering from it all is improbable. Both of these characters take a liking to their more innocent counterparts, seeing in them what they once had but now have lost for reasons that were outside of their control. Clinging to that one person in the hope to keep them sane, and in the case of Banana Fish, no matter how the world might see Ash, Eiji will remain by his side. But similarly to Salinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s short tale, it may not be enough to help Ash change to a more civil lifestyle. \n\nDespite the original manga being set in the 1980\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, Studio MAPPA decided to move the setting to a more modern time and as such caused various changes to the anime that deviate from the original source. Some of the most obvious examples include using character designs typical of the current animation standards rather that the original\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well-defined character models, and the implementation of technology such as smartphones used by the majority of the cast. These changes, whilst they may come off slightly off-putting are fairly harmless in the grand scheme of things. Although when it comes to contemporizing the story and its themes, there are numerous issues that arise. For example, by revising the setting to present day, many of the topics covered can be considered outdated and requires a certain suspension of disbelief not to lose any immersion the viewer has with the world established. This take also renders most of the social commentary the original story had as nearly obsolete, which was one of the aspects that made the manga so important for its time. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something that most viewers probably wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a problem with, as it still remains a piece of fiction that can be enjoyed without social context. But for those that want to look at this show deeper that the ordinary fan, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an issue that can easily cause disappointment amongst certain anime fans.\n\nAnother key issue that I personally had throughout watching was how many elements regarding the plot and characters slowly become narrowed as the series continues. Allow me to elaborate; the beginning of this show was really appealing, not only on a visual level with how vibrant the settings were and the distinct designs on display, but with how many different parts there was to the plotline. From the main characters, to the supporting cast gang members, to the numerous villains, to everyone else involved, each of these groups felt like their own intricate parts to the storyline that had the potential to create something truly special. But as the plot continues, it becomes apparent that the storyline is only meant to focus on the relationship between Ash and Eiji. This is not necessarily a bad thing \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Banana Fish revolves around this in particular. But I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but feel disappointed when a show with so many moving parts to begin with are funnelled out to prioritize all the screen time on the core plotline. Especially if comparing the anime to the manga, which gave more balanced attention to the large cast of characters intertwined. The villains all had varying degrees of depth but none of which I would honestly call complex, most characters not associated with a gang are shafted halfway through the anime and the gang members that are fleshed out are always given time and focus corresponding to their relationship with Ash. This is not a severe knock against the show, but I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help it when I see a series like Banana Fish have so much potential and not seriously capitalize upon it.\n\nThe visuals for Banana Fish are a solid outing for Studio MAPPA. While I have my personal preference for character designs, the animation present here is energetic in how it depicts character movements and expressions, as well as providing the audience with some very exciting action scenes. The dynamic colour palette and background art are both visually appealing that while some might consider it detrimental to the tone of the show, I believe do better to initially attract anime fans to the series in general, acting as a pleasant treat for the eyes at first glance. The framing of the most controversial events that took place in Banana Fish was also commendable in giving the series a good sense of artistry. \n\nThe audio for Banana Fish is also praiseworthy with strong performances for voice acting overall, really capturing the essence of each main character. The soundtrack also fits most scenes well despite none particularly standing out, except for the OP and ED tracks which is just simply fun to listen to. No matter what your music taste, these tracks are pretty accessible and make for fun openers to each episode. The translations however could definitely act as a detriment to the series as a whole depending on your take of the sensitive topics covered in Banana Fish. Personally I found it funny when Ash calls a separate character a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfag\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the translation considering what the series is about, but some could easily take such as a homophobic slur and the anime as a whole as tone-deaf. Just be careful what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting yourself into, k? :)\n\nLooking back on Banana Fish, I see a series with a lot of upside to it. A carefully handled crime drama, innovative for its time, critically acclaimed source material, etc. And despite having my own criticisms against the series I would still recommend this to anyone interested in the series at all. Despite creative liberties it is at its core a well-made drama with emotionally powerful moments that are likely to entrance you in a tale barely brought to light by anime. There may be homoerotic undertones present, but the series was not made solely for such. Instead it clearly values a strong appreciation for storytelling, for that is how people from all different backgrounds can relate to fiction at a fundamental level.\n"}, {"id": 3882, "score": 65, "body": "__(An Abridged Take Inside TRIGGER Studios)__\n\nDirector [claps hands]: _Okay.

Hell, there was even a theory made halfway into Gridman about whether or not Rikka was secretly pregnant with the protagonist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s child the entire time (there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually a fair amount of evidence about it, not gonna lie.) But first impressions are usually not what they seem and this saying holds true for Gridman, as the very first episode comes off as anything but the fun mecha shows its constantly compared to.\n\nSSSS.Gridman introduces its audience with several long shots lasting for uncomfortable periods of time \u00e2\u0080\u0093 focusing on rather mundane things like a pile of shoes and dozens of students leaving school for the day, with only the sounds of cicadas being heard. Our protagonist Yuta wakes up in an unfamiliar room, with an unfamiliar female sitting across from him. The unfamiliarity continues as shots continue having characters fail to dominate the frames they are in, often outsized by their environment; constrained into small spaces of scenes. And when characters are allowed to dominate frames, the camera often takes weird perspectives placed either above or below their eyelines, almost intimately close to these characters. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a strong, distinct direction present that forces the viewer to rarely ever feel comfortable about what is being presented, coupled by a minimalist-style soundtrack that further emphasizes a quiet, environmental atmosphere rarely ever attributed with mecha shows. Its presentation is one that is more inclined to push anime fans away given just how different the show appears to contrast with the majority of anime airing nowadays. Some may call it a series with striking directing techniques that ultimately lacks proper direction. but I would urge otherwise as Gridman still has a lot of upside that helped make it one of the most popular shows of the season.\n\nThe story focuses on amnesiac Yuta Hibike, who after finding himself in the home of fellow classmate Rikka Takarada meets a robot known as Gridman inside of an old computer. This has coincided with a sudden appearance of giant unmoving Kaiji, with one abruptly attacking the city causing Yuta to merge with Gridman to battle the Kaiju. In the aftermath however, the city around them appears rebuilt, with those having died being forgotten and people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s memories being reset around this fact, all bar the main characters. Because of this, Yuta attempts to stop the Kaiji from attacking and uncover the truth behind these disappearances. The mystique behind these events is what ultimately drives the story forward, however majority of the first half of Gridman almost rigidly follows a simple formula akin to tokusetsu monster-of-the-week: slight plot development occurs, monster appears, big hero/monster fight ensues with the heroes coming out on top, maybe some followup and repeat. This is not necessarily a detriment to the show as it works well to further establish most side characters and the setting in general, but once again it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a tool that can easily alienate more viewers looking to see why Gridman is so well-liked.\n\nGridman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cast may not be seriously complex in their characterization nor development but still remain a solid aspect of the series, especially with the chemistry between more characters. The way each of the high school students are able to bounce personalities off each other is impressive and the least someone like myself can ask for of characters barely important to the plot. Although there still are some specific characters worth mentioning: Yuta as an amnesiac portrays a relatable human response in trying to carry on as usual to the best of his ability, reflecting how many of us will often try and find a sense of normalcy, coping to the best of our abilities instead of shutting out entirely despite the desire of sometimes wanting to. Meanwhile on the other side of the spectrum, Akane serves as the main antagonist to Yuta and friends, spending most of her time inside her eerie room, creating Kaiji inspired from daily frustrations and petty grudges. Underneath her outward reputation as a talented student lies a psychologically twisted girl barely able to be kept contained. Thematically, the series dangles along threads of memory and connection and both of these characters are integral to these ideas.\n\nAs far as visuals are concerned, this is where Gridman really shows its strengths. Distinct character designs and colour palette that never overwhelms a single scene, detailed backgrounds that give off an ominous sense of uncertainty, subtle edits to further keep the audience away from any settled feeling. Its animation is somewhat limited considering the number of stills used in Gridman but does utilize a significant amount of 3D animation in conjuction with 2D animation, and here is where opinions can get easily divisive. From the time of Gridman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s airing, anime still has a long way to go with improving CG animation to looking anywhere near as appealing as traditional-style animation, and when both styles are used in the same show, the consensus thought is that it comes off clunky, immersion-breaking and overall detrimental to the show visually. But Gridman stands as an exception to this, with the CG-animated fights coming across more reminiscent to that of tokusetsu battles. In this way, these action scenes give off a similar sense of scale of larger-than-life monsters duking it out, destroying vehicles and buildings as if they were mere toys. These moments also encapsulate what I feel are the best parts of SSSS.Gridman.\n\nWhen a Kaiju attacks and Gridman, the hero and giant ass-kicking robot enters the fray, everything regarding the purposeful directing fades out: the unsettling camera angles, the absence of music, the alienation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 all of the uncanniness is annihilated for this moment courtesy of the triumphant emergence of the hero confronting the evil. All of the sudden the cameras move into action, the music blares out, frames are completely dominated by the two behemoths. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t last very long but for this moment we as viewers finally are at ease and it becomes a glorious release of pent-up emotion. Expert manipulation of the audience that while it may sound simple on paper, could only work under the guise of splendid filmmaking ability. And that, is where SSSS.Gridman truly shines.\n"}, {"id": 3884, "score": 60, "body": "SSSS.Gridman is a truly bizarre experience. After the monumentally disappointing Darling in the FranXX and the surprisingly worthwhile Planet With, this show completes the year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s holy trinity of super robot anime by being a confusing mixed bag that is a nightmare to discuss. While it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly go full Evangelion, there are still references to it as well as stylistic similarities between the two. However, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more to this peculiar anime than just being another run-of-the-mill mecha series.\n\nFirst and foremost, this is both a tokusatsu and super robot anime. Sparing you the lengthy history of both concepts, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear that the trappings of the two genres aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t easy to deal with in contemporary anime\u00e2\u0080\u0094or any anime in the case of tokusatsu. Case in point: while reused animation is common in mecha series, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re mainly utilized for robot transformations and special attacks. However, SSSS.Gridman goes as far as to rewind even non-action scenes, creating unnecessary repetition. Studio Trigger also decided to render the Gridman and its Kaiju foes using CGI, and the jarring blend between these 3D models and their 2D environment causes a serious case of the uncanny valley. Not helping matters is how these hulking titans continually swap between 2D and 3D, making everything they interact with --i.e. the road, the cars, the debris, etc.-- become a visual disaster. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a shame these graphical problems make the fights harder to follow given their cool choreography and sakuga moments.\n\nThe art style of this series is far from appealing. Aesthetically, the show is incredibly bland. The inconsistent animation can sometimes make the faces look like deformed potatoes, which are further accentuated by the uninspired character designs. The characters look incredibly plain apart from their vibrant eyes, and even the more appealing individuals such as Anti and Rikka seem lacking. Another problem is the awkward movements, specifically the hand and arm motions. Long story short, this show has a bunch of visual oddities that dampen the experience.\n\nIn spite of all the aforementioned problems, SSSS.Gridman has a striking direction. There are moments between fights that highlight a sense of discomfort and eerie quietness, similar to the atmospheric pauses in Evangelion. These scenes feel pretentious at times, but the clever framing of shots that illustrate the emotional distance of the characters makes them more engrossing than not. Film buffs might find this directing standard fare, but such a thing is noteworthy in the anime landscape. The dream sequences in episode nine are particularly fun to witness and showcase the creative talent of director Akira Amemiya.\n\nS^4 Gridman heavily restrains its usage of background music. Most non-action scenes lack an accompanying soundtrack. You would think the absence of music makes their purpose more meaningful, but sadly this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the case. Since the soundtracks aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t utilized frequently, none of them are memorable as a result. However, there is one track that stood out: the opening theme \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnion\u00e2\u0080\u009d by OxT. As an uplifting song, it works as a call to action that plays when the main cast is gaining the upper hand against their Kaiju opponents. The song doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always mesh properly with the sequence since it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sometimes too quiet, but when it does, be prepared for some epic moments. Sadly, all this can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be said for the forgettable ending theme.\n\nThe cast of SSSS.Gridman is a mixed bag. For every character like Calibur, whose quirkiness comes from his silent, dorky attitude, we have someone boring like Yuta, our unremarkable protagonist. Most of the main characters, including the titular Gridman, are one-dimensional; the most interesting thing about them is their genuine interactions amongst each other. On the other hand, the three antagonists are highly fascinating. Akane is similar to a child trapped in her own sandbox video game world, twisted by her own influence, loneliness, and creations. One of these creations, Anti, is a foil to Gridman. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an overly serious edgelord so hell-bent on destroying Gridman that he ends up being hilariously awkward in social interactions. He would even pick fights with other Kaiju simply because of his desire to personally kill Gridman. As for Alexis, his voice and demeanor make him seem incredibly humorous and lackadaisical -- even as he shoves a buzzsaw to someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye.\n\nOne irksome trait the cast share is their tendency to restrict themselves for no proper reason. For example, in episode three, Yuta, Calibur, and Gridman worry the others by disappearing after a Kaiju defeats them, only for them to be on standby the entire time. One could make the argument that rushing back into battle or retreating immediately would have tipped the Kaiju off, but they could have escaped after it left since they can just warp back to the shop. \n\nAll this segues perfectly into SSSS.Gridman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obscure narrative. The mystery surrounding the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existentially horrifying world is unnerving in the sense that the narrative gradually becomes more destructive as secrets begin to unravel, a la FranXX. While I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel the show crosses that line enough to destroy any investment I could possibly have --at least until episode 10-- there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fundamental aspect of the world-building that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t strike me the right way. \n\nTiptoeing around spoilers, one of the major gimmicks of this show's world is that everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s memories of the dead are altered when a character dies at the hands of a Kaiju, or a Kaiju gets destroyed. With the exception of the surviving combatants, everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind starts to become hazy. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not quite on the level of Re:Zero where society begins to doubt the existence of certain individuals, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a frustrating gimmick that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t entirely make sense. As such, the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s convoluted narrative makes it difficult to recommend. The asspulls in the second half only adds to this problem.\n\nDespite its various shortcomings, SSSS.Gridman is still an entertaining mecha anime. The fights are fun to watch, the banters between the characters are engaging, and the twisted hellhole of a world leaves viewers with much to ponder. Maybe I would have enjoyed this more if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m familiar with the tokusatsu genre, but I doubt such knowledge would make this show any less difficult to unpack. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an enigmatic mixed bag that I am glad to have watched.\n\n\n\nOh, and on top of the Eva references, this show makes a Gurren Lagann reference, so there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another link between the Gridman Planet With FranXX trio.\n\n\nWritten/Edited by: CodeBlazeFate \nProofread by: Peregrine and Skittles"}, {"id": 3886, "score": 50, "body": "One of the most hyped up shows from last year, not just by the community but by me personally because I like everyone else watched the 3 prequel OVAs which were truly amazing in story telling, artwork, sound, and the sense of wonder and magic you feel when you watch it. It's basically a flashback story of an orphan girl (our hero Chise) who can see monsters and spirits and is at first scared and tries to run away from them but in the process discovers a magical library in the forest where she can find refuge and comfort under the care of the librarian along with other docile magical creatures. The story of the OVA actually has nothing to do with the anime and so can be watched before or after the anime. Considering how much I liked the OVA I went into the anime brimming with expectations.\n\nNow for the anime where all my expectations slowly turned into sadness. The show has NONE of the vibe of the OVA which contrasted the bright cheery side of the magical world with the dark scary side really well. The anime is pretty much all happy go lucky, with Chise meeting humans,dragons,fairies,sorcerers etc after being taken in my Elias and learning about the magical world through some loosely connected short stories. \nSomewhere in here is the origin of my main issue with the show. It's really boring. The anime is really difficult to take seriously most of the time which just negates the drama aspects which is one major reason why it felt really painful to finish. Some of the side stories are just cheesy romances with a supernatural twist. The relationship of the 2 main characters is a very weird one since it's basically some sort of pedophillia/necrophillia but it's they managed to normalize it enough to forget about it after a few episodes. But if this is supposed to be a romance that part also feels very bland and just unnatural and the anime as a whole feels very pretentious as if it's a lot deeper,meaningful and emotional than it really is. The character development while being there for Chise is close to  zero for the rest of the cast. No I don't count Elias learning a few human feelings as development.  \nThe main antagonist in the show is kind of decent and only when he shows up did I feel the show to be worth watching.\n\nConclusion, I would give the anime a skip unless it's REALLY your cup of tea kind of show. I would fully recommend people to just watch the OVA even though you would probably be left wanting more."}, {"id": 3895, "score": 52, "body": "Sigh; here we go. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIsland\u00e2\u0080\u009d is probably the most show that has great potential. It brings a tale with traditional trope about amnesia, looking for something missing, time travel, and romance. However, this show is trying so hard to be complex. It turned out to be a disappointing show that tried to focus on not just a plot. Even so, this is \u00e2\u0080\u009cDonnie Darko\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cBack to the Future\u00e2\u0080\u009d wannabe. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I heard from one of the reviewers who said it. I forget who wrote it like that.\n\nThis series is based on a visual novel to say at least. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to find a good series based on visual novels. Some are actually good in a different sense. \u00e2\u0080\u009cClannad\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cSteins;Gate\u00e2\u0080\u009d are premiere example for that. But, why doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it work with this show? With such a simple premise, complexity will make it even better. But, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a piece of unsettling. From the beginning, it was in vain, especially the plot-twist. All characters development from start to finish even raises many questions.\n\nThis anime uses the island as the main setting. Except for the second arc where I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll discuss it afterward. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taking place on an island, Urashima. In short, this is an island that alienates its existence. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re far from society and other cities. There is no contact for other islands. But, that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make them have to suffer. On the contrary, this island has many mysteries. From here, the show will deeper its narrative. There are so many \u00e2\u0080\u0098suspense\u00e2\u0080\u0099 things that combine intermediaries between past, present, and future.\n\nSetsuna Sanzenkai is the main character for this show. And I give you a damn thing. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not one of the worst MC all the time from all the anime. However, this is more a representation of blank characterization. If you want to make a character look more real, just write with a variety of characteristics, background, or anything. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t leave everything empty and flat. Anyway, this character comes from the future or the past. Nobody knows, nobody cares.\n\nThis guy has a lot of vague impression on his background. He can catch a glimpse of his future and past. He was amnesia after being stranded on an island. But more importantly, he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really have the impression of caring or take any right decision. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not much he does. And the fact that he is the main character, it feels so flat and has no motivation other than looking for lost memories. Even when the show reaches a climax, his characteristic immediately turns into some kind of a brat. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just nut.\n\nOn the other hand, there are three main heroines: Rinne Ohara, Karen Kurutsu, and Sara Garandou. They all have a lot of flashbacks and good theories for Setsuna and the islands they live on. In addition, they also have many problems and connections where Setsuna will help. So, this is indeed very similar to the visual novel. Although to be honest, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never played it at all.\n\nAt first, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good. I love all developments and various problems where Setsuna completes it. Including sub-romance or whatever, and Rinne. However, all that is meaningless. I just love why the second arc seems to want to make it deep, a lot of explanation, and a vague impression. Rinne Ohara is the most meaningless when talking about this. Initially, like this. But suddenly, it turns out like that. And then, they die. Then, we go through times. There are many similar characters even though they are not the same character. Suddenly, immediately returned to the first episode. Is it mindf*ck? Yes. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get me wrong, all the storytelling of each character is great. But, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just an eye for an eye.\n\nThis is a kind of show where I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll recommend for a newbie audience. I would recommend for those who only want eye candy service with a bit of complex story. This is one of them. This show is very good for audiences like that. But, the most part is why this anime is so missing apart from its blank characterization which is the pace. The pace is too fast. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a fast-paced but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just too fast. The show stepping from one comedy part became dramatic then became a comedy and became disturbing. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to stay and breathe in one time. You have to carry everything at once to continue the journey again. The comedy is just your typical cheesy thing with fanservice. Just miss.\n\nThis show uses the island as its major theme and I love that. This is one of the redeeming quality of anime with a bad story but good animation. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well-designed and the atmosphere is so relaxing. Sometimes, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to understand a philosophical thing about isolation or society. Just enjoy that life with your casual clothes. The characters design is pretty good though. The sound is just a generic-type. But sometimes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relaxing. The voice acting was pretty good as well. Just nothing unique. Average.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIsland\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a mistake of all. This is more worthy of being called time travel with romance gone wrong. For the ending, I think there will be a few percents of all for the second season. However, this is more of a show for newbies. The premise has great potential to make it even more complex. But, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just useless from the beginning to the end. All the character is just flat and dull. The animation and the soundtrack are pretty good. This is a kind of show you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to think much. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that deep. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just another example of poor based on a visual novel anime."}, {"id": 3898, "score": 62, "body": "K-On! is one of those shows that gets tossed around a lot as a great example of a slice of life comedy, being one of the more popular examples of one.  It's also one of the most mentioned entry tier slice of life shows, pretty much one of those must watch shows due to sheer popularity factor and inertia on the internet.  It was one of the first entries in the \"cute girls doing cute things\" genres that I sat down and watched, mostly on recommendations from folks and the sheer popularity of it.  I was hoping to see what the slice of life genre was all about and this was obviously the place to start from what everyone was saying and my own limited experience in the genre.\n\nThe first time that I watched K-On!, I didn't quite know what to expect from these types slice of life shows.  I grew up watching things like Hokuto no Ken and Cowboy Bebop.  I admit to a bit of a bias as to what I expected animated entertainment to be.  This wasn't going to be shounen action, mecha, or deep science fiction/fantasy, this was going to be about high school girls working to put together their band, and they were going to be adorable and drink tea while doing it.  \n\nWith regards to the technical, the art fully commits to its style. Nothing spectacular, but familiar looking. Animation can feel a bit wonky at times. The sounds are done pretty well, the music that is performed does actually sound like J-pop, and the voice acting doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give me any right to complain. The opening and closing credits are catchy, and the other songs that are performed work as well. I still occasionally find myself humming the tunes from the show when I think back on it.  This is the high-water mark of the show in my opinion. K-On!\u00e2\u0080\u0099s major stumbles are story and character development.\n\nI wanted to give the show a full season of viewing to make sure that I was seeing what everyone else was seeing.  Going in with high expectations was a bit of a mistake in this case.  I struggled to figure out what everyone was seeing in this show, even after a full viewing, even if on balance, I found myself enjoying the show.\n\nI was hoping to see more about the struggles of putting together a musical performance and how a light music club would operate, but was a bit disappointed that each episode seemed to be more about tea and dessert time and screwing around than actual Light Music. This could be interesting if it was a couple episodes before the story got a bit more serious/urgent, but that was the story in just about every episode. \n\nTo be fair, the story does have somewhat of a progression of time in it, with various activities happening more or less due to the needs of a light music club. Instruments are acquired, the girls work on the theory of practicing or song writing for a few minutes, and then they are back to doing pretty much what they were doing earlier, which is having a tea party and reacting to their situation in a clich\u00c3\u00a9d way based on their character tropes.\n\nThe characters in K-On! are not very deep or complex, and they pretty much have their one or two shticks that become a punchline repeatedly throughout the series. I watched the entire first season and past the first two or three episodes, I had figured out what the characters were going to do in most of the situations they were presented with. \n\nThe lazy characters were going to be lazy, the timid, serious one was going to freak out about something when she tried to get things back to serious, the refined one was going to make tea to calm everyone down, and the adult in the room was going to try to get the club into cosplay. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basically each episode in total, with perhaps a school festival, beach, or holiday setting to break things up once every couple episodes or vary the weather a little.\n\nI understand that cute girls doing cute things is a part of anime these days, and in that, I suppose that the show delivers, as for the most part, they all play their cute reactions to the situations well, and things comfortably meander along, same as they ever were in each episode.  This is what slice of life typically does, although the good slice of life does generally wander towards some character growth and resolution.   \n\nHowever, outside of the opening and closing credits, the Light Music Club seems to do precious little actual music composition and practice, which left me thoroughly confused, somewhat frustrated, and wondering if I was totally missing the point as people seem to love this show and recommend it as a must watch. \n\nThe big question that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had a hard time answering after watching the first season is if the whole music club is really necessary to tell this high school story. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure it added much to be honest, and it could have been any club at all if we're being fair.  One can sympathize with the poor kouhai of the show wondering why they're even in the club and despairing that no actual musical practice or anything is being done.  One would think that there would be a bit more musical passion from the main cast if the show was going to be about a music club, and not just stumble towards the big concert or what have you.  The music itself always seemed like a bit of a distraction from the next scene of the girls doing something that was exaggeratedly cute.  \n\nTo take example of another slice of life show about a high school club from the same year or so, Saki, the mahjong oriented high school anime, actually felt like a more compelling show to watch, even if it was technically weaker in art, animations, sound, etc.  It was also full of somewhat unnecessary fan service, somewhat exaggerated mahjong super powers, and trope heavy characters.  However, they went hard on the mahjong angle, and the story arc worked as the characters worked together to play and get better and the slice of life and character development occurred through the act of enjoying their club activities.  While I don't think Saki was a masterpiece, I look back on K-On! and wonder why they didn't take a similar approach towards making the music the focus instead of the cute stuff.  I think it would have worked for the better.  \n\nAll said, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get too much out of K-On!, as perhaps I was looking for something a little more substantial (I realize that may be misguided with a show like this). When a song is actually played by the group, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decent enough to watch. The problem is that this happens so rarely that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just not enough to really make up for the problem of it being the same thing over and over each episode. \n\nThere are shows with characters that are interesting enough to make you want to see them interact in various situations and the comedy or drama involved will make it entertain you.  I watched Azumanga Daioh some time after K-On! and discovered what slice of life really should be when trying to show high school girls life where nothing of grand import happens.  There was a charm to Azumanga that K-On! was trying to replicate, but didn't quite get there in my opinion.  \n\nIn fairness to the show, I recently re-watched K-On!'s first season to see if I got anything else out of it after watching quite a few more slice of life shows.  I would say that my opinion of K-On! has improved a bit from my initial reaction, but I still prefer other shows in the genre with a bit more character development and stronger personalities.  I did find a reasonable amount of entertainment (or maybe relaxation is a better word) in the show after completely turning the mind off and just floating along with it, but this isn't something that I can do for more than a couple episodes at a time.\n\nI highly recommend that you avoid my mistakes in the slice of life genre and start with something like Azumanga Daioh to see what slice of life and cute girl shows do well.  Then watch K-On! afterward.  It helps to have some perspective to compare this one to.    \n\nWhile this review probably comes across as a bit negative, I still enjoyed K-On! quite a bit.  But, it's not as high on my list of favorite slice of comedies for the reasons mentioned.  When the group of girls actually play music, it's done pretty well.  I would have liked to have seen more of it, and consider the show a bit of a wasted opportunity.\n\nIt's still worth a watch, it's had a large enough impact on anime culture that it is worth your time.  It's also worth noting that sometimes, \"fun things are fun\" and you shouldn't take anything too seriously anyway.  That is worth something in my book.   \n"}, {"id": 3905, "score": 60, "body": "# __Hi__\n\nToday I want to write some random scattered thoughts about Toradora.  I watched all 25 episodes in one day yesterday and have some things I want to get down on paper (figuratively).  I decided I wouldn't write negative reviews anymore, which is why I have decided this isn't a review, it's just some scattered thoughts, organized roughly by topic headers.  You'll have to forgive this as I don't want to spend the extra hours forming this into a proper review.  You won't understand any of this if you haven't watched Toradora, so for those who haven't: I would recommend watching this only if you are a fan of melodrama.  This is a show that only barely could be classified as romance.\n\nTo the reader: Naturally this will include Toradora spoilers.  I welcome discussion via profile comments if you are so inclined.\n\n# __Plot__\n\nThe plot is driven forward by Ryuuji's crush on Minori and Taiga's crush on Kitamura.  But neither of these romances ever feel believable.  Kitamura/Taiga and Ryuuji/Minori have no chemistry.  Even with all of the scenes of Taiga blushing up a storm in front of Kitamura and Ryuuji clamming up when Minori is around I don't *feel* it.  It just feels as if the show is forcing us to accept that these two have the crushes they do solely because that is the premise of the show and nothing would happen otherwise.  Only the main ship ever had a chance of sailing anywhere which makes all the fiddling around with these side romances up until basically the last couple episodes feel incredibly frustrating.  All I want to see is Ryuuji and Taiga happy together.\n\n# __Kitamura__\n\nPerhaps the biggest problem with Toradora is this guy.\n\nimg220(https://i.imgur.com/LQl4DJU.jpg)\n\nYuusaku Kitamura is evil.  If you ship him with Taiga, you are evil.  Taiga confesses to him in the second episode or so.  He denies her - but not by saying \"I'm sorry, I like someone else now.\"  He does so in the lightest possible fashion, in order to incite Taiga to keep pursuing him regardless.  He further provokes her at every opportunity - taking every chance to be alone with her, or come in physical contact, or dance with her at the bonfire - __all the while fully aware that she has already confessed to him.__  In order to stoke the flames of her heart and keep her running after him.  He plays with her feelings over the course of basically an entire year, and for what?  I can only think of two reasons:\n1. He is just a sadist, and takes sick pleasure in torturing Taiga emotionally despite having no intent to ever get together with her.  Or,\n2. He knows he probably will get turned down by the student council president once he works up the courage to confess to her, so he wants to keep Taiga around for \"backup\" in case that happens.  In which case he is just pure scum.\n\nIn either case, clearly he is a malicious character.  However, the issue is not that he's evil, but that I don't believe Toradora is intelligent enough to realize this.  Certainly no characters in the show ever confront him over his emotional manipulation, and it is never a plot point, which makes me think that his despicable behavior was not intentional on the author's part, which if so is just incompetent.  But even if if it is intentional, and Kitamura is meant to be like two-faced Ami but 100x worse, this aspect of his character is never explored in the story so it's basically irrelevant.\n\n# __Just Talk With Each Other__\n\nSeeing a confession in the second episode might give you hope for Toradora breaking the mold of traditional Japanese romance anime where every character is incapable of speaking anything they are feeling, but those hopes will be betrayed ten times over. \n You will be yelling \"JUST TALK WITH EACH OTHER!\" at the screen, either in your mind or literally, while watching this show.  Perhaps the worst example of this is after Taiga is rescued from the snow.\n\nimg720(https://i.imgur.com/nuwx2Tf.jpg)\n#####~~~_I'm sorry_  ___WHAT___~~~\n\nWhy does Ryuuji ask this of Kitamura?  The entire series has been nothing but people covering up their feelings with lies.  Does he still intend to get with Minori at this point?  It's just like... What the f\\*\\*\\* are you even doing Ryuuji?  Minori, after finding out Ryuuji has done this, is justifiably furious, despite her having done the same s\\*\\*\\* throughout the series.  I suppose that segues into the next topic well.\n\n# __Angry Scenes__\n\nSome of the best scenes in the anime are when characters get angry or fight over the fact that other characters are lying about their feelings.  It's very telling of what a viewer can expect from Toradora that this is prevalent enough to justify it being its own sub-subgenre.\n\nThe Ami vs. Minori fights, both verbal and physical, are great, as is the Taiga vs. Student Council President one.\n\nimg720(https://i.imgur.com/ZmL3IgR.jpg)\n\nAnd as I mentioned above, the one where Minori gets furious with Ryuuji is a classic.\n\nimg720(https://i.imgur.com/M6tprCX.png)\n#####~~~_\"JUST STOP IT ALREADY!\"_~~~\n#####~~~_\"hurr durr\"_~~~\n\n#####\u00e2\u0080\u0082\n# __Taiga Showing She Cares For Ryuuji Scenes__\n\nimg720(https://i.imgur.com/k8I9x3z.jpg)\n\nThe other type of scenes that were enjoyable where the ones where Taiga shows she cares for Ryuuji.  In particular, these are when Ryuuji was close to drowning in the pool, after Ryuuji left Taiga's apartment for the Christmas party, the bridge scene, and the kiss scene.  Honestly I think if you want to watch Toradora, you should watch up until the pool episode, then just skip to the penultimate episode.  In between there is just a bunch of melodrama where no one is happy and that's not fun for anyone.\n\n# __The Ending__\n\nimg720(https://i.imgur.com/gSqDetx.jpg)\n#~~~___...WHAT___~~~\n\nThe ending is so stupid.  The whole anime has a theme of finally learning to express your feelings and not keep them bottled up inside, and how does Taiga express her desire to return to her mother's house and mend her family relationships before returning to Ryuuji?  By leaving a note - a tiny little insignificant note - for the love of her life, speaking NOT ONE WORD to him, before leaving for an ENTIRE YEAR at the DROP OF A HAT.  What the FUCK is this.  All she had to do is TALK TO RYUUJI!  WHY DIDN'T SHE JUST TALK WITH HIM?  WHAT THE FUCK!  AAAAAAAAAAAAA\n\n# __Why SAO Is the Best Love Story Ever Told__\n\nOkay, it's not, but hear me out.  Some minor spoilers for SAO ahead if you care about that.  The few harem-y elements in the beginning are just for fun, since at its core SAO is a love story, specifically that of Kirito and Asuna.  The two meet, over the course of two years their relationship grows, eventually they realize they care deeply for one another, and they join together.  There is no melodrama (well, melodrama within the romance), the characters say what their feel, the plot isn't needlessly dragged out to prolong the inevitable pairing of the main couple until the last episode, the scenes showing the love between the main characters are heartwarming and believable, there is no bullshit to create even more drama AFTER the confession, and perhaps most importantly, we get to see the characters living happily together.  What more could you ask for?\n\nimg720(https://i.imgur.com/AxDnePM.jpg)\n\nFor these reasons, despite all its flaws SAO is a much more competent love story than Toradora, or indeed basically any other anime rom-com or rom-dram I've seen.  It is bizarre to me that anime producers don't understand the strong demand for happy, reciprocal, stable, consummated relationships.  It is even more bizarre to me that so many people watch Toradora or other Mari Okada dadaist insanity and see no issues with how the characters behave.\n\n# __Other Assorted Thoughts__\n\n __Side Ships__\nI would support Student Council President x Kitamura, except Kitamura is evil so I don't want him to be with anyone.  I also would support Ami x Minori - certainly that pairing has more chemistry than any other pairings each of the two could be in.  But I find myself against it just because Ami deserves better, as probably the most interesting character in the show.  She certainly deserves better than Ryuuji and somehow I don't see Minori making her happy either, even new, reformed, \"actually speaks her mind\" Minori.\n\n__VA Work, Art__\n\nimg720(https://i.imgur.com/YTfPn3b.jpg)\n\nRie Kugimiya is brilliant as Taiga, great casting and great acting.  Similarly, Taiga is drawn incredibly adorably.  One of the most visually appealing anime characters I can think of.  The art in general is excellent also.\n\n__Tsundere Overload?__\nSome people have called Taiga's violence too much, often calling her a \"bitch\".  Normally I am not too tolerant of excessive female-on-male violence but for whatever reason I was totally fine with it in Toradora.  Taiga is just too cute.\n\n__Mountain Rescue Stupidity__\n\nimg220(https://i.imgur.com/eFZSEBz.jpg)\n\n...Why did they just leave the scene where Taiga disappeared and go back to the hotel for several hours?  Why didn't they investigate for two seconds as soon as they noticed she was gone and see the obvious tracks from where she fell?\n\n#__Final Thoughts__\nToradora is a melodrama anime, not a romance anime.  The characters are frustrating and arguably the best-written one (Ami) does not play enough of a role to overshadow everything else the other characters manage to get themselves into.  Even if you ship the correct main couple you won't come away satisfied due to the ridiculous ending.  Despite all of this, I do have to praise Toradora for being incredibly gripping.  I simply couldn't put it down.  I think this is because Taiga and Ryuuji are just such a compelling couple.  I wanted to see them together, to realize their love and become happy together.  I think I loved everything up through episode 7, but after that it should have skipped all the melodrama from that point on to the finish and just focused on the main couple. In the end I don't know if that temptation to keep watching the next episode was worth it."}, {"id": 3915, "score": 69, "body": "When I was 13 I thought this was the greatest anime ever made, and that sentiment is probably everything  you need to know about Guilty Crown. \n\nThat said, while I see it's flaws, It's still a guilty pleasure (no pun intended) for me. As an initial statement, if all you've seen is Sword Art Online, Naruto, and Bleach, then this is a great anime to watch to see what else the medium has to offer, and I mean that in a mostly positive way. \n\nthe Art and Animation, for example, is just great, and is probably the pinnacle of what 2011 had to offer, which is saying a lot. Characters stay on model, the movements are fluid, the faces are expressive, the fights are well choreographed, the lighting is atmospheric, the sets are well designed and drawn, the CG is relatively well integrated. The backgrounds are my personal favorite element of the series, with tons of detail and imagination. overall, this aspect of Guilty Crown is a 10/10, and it still holds up today in this department.\n\nAnd then there's the soundtrack. I don't care if you watch Guilty Crown or not - Listen to the fucking soundtrack, Egoist, (the band formed specifically for this show and who have stuck together since then, producing some of the best that J-pop today) pulled out all the stops with this one. It really is just great. Also, the Op and Ed is superb and I still listen to it sometimes. definitely 10/10\n\nBut here is where everything starts to slip up.\n\nThe characters are a mixed bag. Shu, our protagonist, is bland and pretty forgettable, but his character arch is strong, going through multiple changes over the series and it ends with him becoming a genuinely stronger and better person. He's not revolutionaly by any means but he isn't terrible or even boring. Guy is my personal favorite, with his cool demeanor and shady background. Most of the side characters are pretty static (with exceptions) but they all have strong presence and recognizable quirks and characteristics. The only real problem with the characters is Inori, Shu's love interest, and unfortunately this is a pretty big one. Despite having the best design in the series and being critical to the plot, she is confusing and indesicive, frustratingly submissive, and worst of all boring as dirt and blander than bread. I genuinely belive if she memorable or interesting at all, all other problems aside, this show wouldv'e become a classic, but no, over the course of 22 episodes, we learn nothing of interest about her personality, and she never contributes except at a plot device, why so many people love her is a mystery. 5/10\n\nThen there's the story, and I'd like to say a few things. 1) I actually loved the mid season twist (Spoiler alert! the reveal of Shu's dead sister), and I think the second half is the more entertaing of the two. 2) No, this show isn't ripping off Code Geass, or Evangelion, or any other show for that matter, it's just using broader themes that resonate with the Japanese people, such as a disease killing everyone, Japan being at the mercy of foreign Nations, the youth rapidly advancing beyond Japans tradition oriented culture, and so forth, as well common tropes and elements that exist in any sci fi and fantasy anime. 3) the plot is great at creating mood and atmosphere; the beginning is fun shounen hype while the end is lovecraftian in its nihilsim and the show in general is filled with a sense of dread and mystery. \n\nbut when we get to the actual plot well . . .\nthe plot is stupid. I've heard some say the premise is good and the show just fails to execute it, and I mean, kind of? but the premise is honestly both overused and really stupid at the same time. the Guilty Crown itself makes no sense and is stupid, the SoL elements are dull, the grand plot reveal is dissapointng, 5/10\n\na few other random complaints\n-a terrorist orginization made up of teenagers? really?\n-why did Inori orgasm evertime Shu pulled out her sword?\n-the fansevice was really distracting\n-actually, every moment that was supposed to be \"inspirational\" was cringy as fuck\n-so did Shu's step mom really want to bang him? what?\n-purple haired bad guy was annoying. blonde brat too\n-tsundere was a bitch. I hated her\n\nOverall 6.9 out of 10\nthis show has great moments but overall the show is just okay, or rather, it's divisive in its elements. Personally i like it but I can see why others don't\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": 3916, "score": 60, "body": "Gridman is the proof that every TRIGGER show (except Imaishi's directed) are going to be a disappointment, except Little Witch Academia and Inferno Cop.\n\nIt's 2018 and we got an anime adaptation of Gridman, Tsuburuya's failed attempt to make another ultra series. That was a joke and I haven't seen the original Gridman. But, hey, no one does.\n\nIn my monthly reading of Tokupedia forums to find a good Toku to watch since Zi-O and Lupin vs Pato is a big disappointment, I found this. This thing is called another disappointment.\n\nAs a Tokusatsu, the writing is bound to be cheesy. But here's the thing about Gridman, it wasn't cheesy enough. What is the right amount of cheese? If the Toei Spider-Man is the cheesiest, the Power Rangers Movie (the old one) is the right amount, then the Godzilla VS movies are beyond the right amount just because you can see Godzilla \"Symbol for Atom Bombs\" dicking around and fight other monsters with various comedic ways.\n\nAfter blurting out some Toku references, I forgot that I'm supposed talking about the story. The structure of each episode is repetitive just like every live-action tokusatsu, but in the live action, the monster moves like a baby that can only jump and flail their arms around like an idiot and whenever the mecha are combined it's stood there, gloriously, that what's makes watching Tokusatsu as a grown man is all about. This thing's monster and mecha are fully CG, not the entire show just the most important part of any tokusatsu series.\n\nI see this video in my YouTube recommendations talking about how the janky low framerate movement is realistic and it encapsulates the movement of the bodysuit, that video was made by the same person who thinks the Detective Pikachu trailer is good. If a tokusatsu is done in animation, the designs should be more expressive and the movements more fluid. Instead, they use cheap 3DCG with stiff motion. This is even worse than Shin Godzilla. What we can take from all this? Ultraman (2019) is safe to skip.\n\nSo let's move to the characters, there's amnesia boy, cucked glasses, thigh girl, god girl, and an alien wearing Kamina shades. Whenever I see a TRIGGER character using those shades, I got reminded the fact that Kamina died a virgin. The God girl is TRIGGER's attempt to make another religion, the only thing that stands in their way is that Akaneism doesn't roll off the tongue very well. The character design is the best thing about the show, I found 31 artists to follow just by looking at Danbooru, I only found 14 with Yuru Camp. The subtle naming of the mecha power up cast's school is the most stealthy reference of the decade that only people with high IQ will understand and the voice for Rikka's mom is just Haruko.\n\nDespite all this, I fully enjoy it. The dream sequence at episode 9 is exciting, the background kaiju are really cool, the character interactions are fun, the last fight finally uses 2D, the last shot makes me giggle like a little kid and this makes hopeful for another TRIGGER anime."}, {"id": 3931, "score": 50, "body": "img520(http://i.imgur.com/1t3tmFM.png)\n\nAs far as ecchi anime go, Iketeru Futari was pretty darn bad. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not even sure where to begin. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s go with the description found on Wikipedia and work our way from there, shall we?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c16-year old Keisuke Saji loves to fantasize about young beautiful women. He hopes to land the object of his affection, Koizumi Akira. However, Koizumi hates Saji (as well as all men) to the point of assault. While most guys take Koizumi's cold shoulder as a hint, Saji pursues head-on without having rejection faze him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe description of some horndog harassing an asexual/lesbian girl didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give me much confidence in the show going in. The actual show is paradoxically better, yet worse than this description would lead you to believe. In good news, at least from what I could gather, Koizumi doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually hate men. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a story of \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe right guy\u00e2\u0080\u009d mounting a war of attrition in an attempt to change a violent girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sexuality. Instead, Koizumi proves so confusing that I still don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a read on her, and Saji\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so unlikable that Koizumi striking him was 100% justified.\n\nEpisodes of Iketeru are ~six minutes long. As stated before, the show is ecchi \u00e2\u0080\u0094 shamelessly so. Practically every other episode begins with a sexual fantasy, there are detailed panty-shots galore, and plenty of bare breasts. If you like fanservice, then boy...you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re probably better off somewhere else. The anime also tries to have a bonafide story, and at only six minutes an episode, you can see where the problem lies. Given how much of the runtime comprises of Saji being a lecher and dumb jokes, attempts to be serious are laughable and jarring. \n\nThe anime focuses on Koizumi, Rei Ayame\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slightly more emotive, dimensionally displaced twin sister. Her only notable traits are that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s diminutive in size, mysterious, and cagey. Why is she mysterious? Who knows? Who cares? The anime didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give me any answers, so I just rolled my eyes whenever her mysteriousness was brought up. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help that said mysteriousness is stated, never shown. \n\nimg520(http://pm1.narvii.com/5664/c3e1b8b267a524510f1ee3e94dc0b005e69a097a_00.jpg)\n\nWhile Koizumi is boring, Saji is downright insufferable. He can barely function because if he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not groping someone or staring at their panties, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s having a sexual fantasy that he conflates with reality. The anime tried to push a romance, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unbelievable thanks to the fact that Saji will get his rocks off to any woman. \n\nThere are a few other recurring characters, but they might as well be cardboard boxes. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a love triangle with Saji\u00e2\u0080\u0099s childhood friend that ultimately goes nowhere, in case you wanted your time to be even more wasted.\n\nCharacter relations don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make any sense. In the first episode, Koizumi has a fun night with Saji. Okay, fine. The problem is that the next day and for the rest of the series, she goes on hating him. If the anime was going to have Koizumi dislike Saji, it should have did away with their date at the beginning of the series. Koizumi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feeling toward Saji flip flop so often that I was just left confused.  \n\nThe anime also tries to be comedic, but none of the jokes landed for me. The comedy amounts to Saji screaming (which I found obnoxious), Koizumi and other women beating the living crap out of Saji (which was justified, but not funny), and Saji making goofy faces (which still weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t goofy enough to garner a laugh).\n\nimg520(https://neko-anime.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IketeruFutari_08.jpg)\n\nDespite sex-appeal being this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest strength, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not even that good. The cel-shaded art automatically places this as an older anime, but the nostalgia stops there, because the art is pretty average, and at times just plain bad. The character designs aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t too striking, which is practically a cardinal sin when making erotic animation. The only thing that would help is accented features, and for the most part, proportions are fairly plain in Iketeru Futari. Sure, there are times when the show is sexy, but those moments are few and far between.\n\n\nThe last episode is a perfect example of the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s faults. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a dramatic episode, but we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really know why the characters make the decisions that they do. It ultimately ends with character relationships back to square one, with nothing resolved. I guess I prefer that than the show trying to pretend it had dignity all this time.\n\nIketeru Futari is a comedy that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not funny, a romance that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anything but romantic, and an ecchi that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seldom sexy. It flounders in nearly every aspect. To add insult to injury, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just plain gross. The short runtime doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make it more enjoyable; it makes it more bearable.\n\n5/10\n\nD-\n\n\n"}, {"id": 3936, "score": 65, "body": "Parti fran\u00c3\u00a7aise\n\nC\u00e2\u0080\u0099est quoi l\u00e2\u0080\u0099histoire en r\u00c3\u00a9sum\u00c3\u00a9 ?\nGoblin slayer est un anime qui nous raconte l\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c3\u00a9pop\u00c3\u00a9e d\u00e2\u0080\u0099un aventurier, Goblin Slayer, et nous raconte au fur et \u00c3\u00a0 mesure qui il est r\u00c3\u00a9ellement.\n\nEt en d\u00c3\u00a9taille ?\nCette anim\u00c3\u00a9e nous apprennent plusieurs choses dont la premi\u00c3\u00a8re et la plus importante selon moi sont la fa\u00c3\u00a7on de voir les petites difficult\u00c3\u00a9s non pas comme des petites mais justement comme des grandes ce qui nous permet donc de toujours \u00c3\u00aatre pr\u00c3\u00aat \u00c3\u00a0 tout \u00c3\u00a0 peu pr\u00c3\u00a8s, de plus on voit aussi les bienfaits de l'entraide dans un groupe ce qui est beau \u00c3\u00a0 voir.\n\nParlons du personnag principale en particulier, LE Goblin Slayer, au tout d\u00c3\u00a9but de son aventure, il refuse toute aide et travail uniquement en solitaire mais la nonne, Onna Shinkan, parvient \u00c3\u00a0 travailler avec lui et de l\u00c3\u00a0 s\u00e2\u0080\u0099ensuit un groupe d\u00e2\u0080\u0099aventuriers qui tue les goblins ensemble, ce groupe est compos\u00c3\u00a9 de Yousei Yunde, une elfe arch\u00c3\u00a8re, Tokage Souryo, un l\u00c3\u00a9zard pr\u00c3\u00aatre, et de Kouhito Doushi, un nain chaman.\n\n\u00c3\u0080 la toute fin de l'anime, le Goblin Slayer demande de l\u00e2\u0080\u0099aide \u00c3\u00a0 toute la guilde d\u00e2\u0080\u0099aventurier pour sauver l\u00e2\u0080\u0099endroit o\u00c3\u00b9 il vit mais surtout l\u00e2\u0080\u0099endroit ou vit une personne proche de lui, Ushikai Musume, son amie d\u00e2\u0080\u0099enfance.\n\n\nEnglish part\n\nWhat's the story in short?\nGoblin slayer is an anime that tells us the story of an adventurer, Goblin Slayer, and tells us as we go along who he really is.\n\nAnd details?\nThis animated film teaches us several things, the first and most important of which, in my opinion, are the way we see small difficulties not as small ones but precisely as large ones, which allows us to always be ready for almost everything, and we also see the benefits of mutual aid in a group, which is beautiful to see.\n\nLet's talk about the main character in particular, LE Goblin Slayer, at the very beginning of his adventure, he refuses any help and work only alone but the nun, Onna Shinkan, manages to work with him and from there follows a group of adventurers who kill goblins together, this group is composed of Yousei Yunde, an archaic elf, Tokage Souryo, a priest lizard, and Kouhito Doushi, a midget shaman.\n\nAt the very end of the anime, the Goblin Slayer asks the whole adventurer's guild for help to save the place where he lives but especially the place where a person close to him, Ushikai Musume, his childhood friend, lives.\n"}, {"id": 3943, "score": 56, "body": "The second season of Iron-Blooded Orphans is a disjointed sequel that is disappointing to say the least.

In the first season, the audience was introduced to a group of battle-hardened child soldiers bent on forging their own path. And like almost any other story in the same vein, there is tragedy and death along the way. While this aspect of IBO continues on in the first season, IBO S2 suffers from the problem of creating tragedy for the sake of tragedy. \n\nAnd yes, this is Iron-Blooded Orphans, so expect protagonists to die as well.\n\nWhereas the first season had Tekkadan members die in order to create meaningful plot development, the second season feels rather empty when it comes to its attempt at creating emotional and poignant events. \n\nFor instance, when characters die, their deaths cease to have an impact beyond the scope of maybe one or two episodes after. \n\nAnother problem would be the way Tekkadan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growth as a mercenary outfit is handled. The boss, Orga, constantly doubts his own ability to lead. And although this is a very logical flaw to have in a character thrust in an unfriendly world, it becomes rather annoying when these flaws are mentioned in almost every single episode. Many of the great characters of Tekkadan have become relegated to being tools for the writers to directly tell the audience how Orga is developing as a character.\n\nCharacter development should be implicit, rather than directly stated. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need characters literally laying it out for the audience in order for us to see that characters have changed. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need three minutes of dialogue about how the crew members think that so-and-so has changed as a person. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just lazy writing if anything.\n\nSo basically, if you thought Eugene was a great character in the first season, prepare to be disappointed. His main role is going to be simply reminding you of how Orga\u00e2\u0080\u0099s changing as a leader.\n\nFinally, a huge problem I noticed was how plot twists or surprises seem either artificial and / or obvious. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll notice what I mean as soon as the character of Vidar is introduced. If you are seriously surprised to find out who he is later on in the season, then you are really not paying any attention.\n\nI really wished the second season could live up to the high standards of the first, but alas, that is not the case."}, {"id": 3953, "score": 55, "body": "The type of shows that appeal to kids, specifically for boys, are normally the kind that revolves around action, sci-fi and supernatural powers\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially if the theme is of a superhero-esque flavour. This hodgepodge of styles makes up for a similar formula we have seen one too many times, however, while it is very unspectacular, Majin Bone has the charm to make it watchable for all audiences. It depicts the life of a young boy who gains powers and turns into a robotic-armoured fighter with dragon powers to save the world from its enemies. Very simple, very lacking but again, it has the charm of most tokusatsu shows of the past that makes a bit more endearing.\n\nMajin Bone is based on Bandai\u00e2\u0080\u0099s digital card game of the same name. It started with the manga being published in the magazine Saikyo Jump and within three months it received an adaptation from Toei Animation to help promote the game and the merchandise. At the centre of the story, a young boy named Shougo Ryuujin finds himself caught in the middle of a war between armoured fighters who are wreaking havoc and destruction around a city, fighting battles between themselves in both, reality and in a digital-cyber world. Oblivious at first about this, his friend Saho Shimatami constantly points him in the direction of aliens and soon discovers foreign sounds that draw him to this mysterious object. Are trio of strangers observe from afar, who later turn out to be the people he teams up with later in Antonio, Tyrone and Luke. But for now, they are pedestrians to a bad situation for Shougo when a warrior accosts him when he comes into contact with a magical stone tablet and merges with it. \n\nShougo becomes Dragon Bone, one of five White Bone warriors who have the duty to save the world from the hands of Dark Bone. This is the gist of the show, about our main protagonist learning his powers of the Dragon Bone and defeating the villains in a similar vein\u00e2\u0080\u0094whilst also dealing with the sexual tension of having his best friend Saho staying in the same house as him\u00e2\u0080\u0094her family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home got destroyed in the aforementioned fight\u00e2\u0080\u0094and her discovering his porn collection doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bode well for our young hero. What I need to make clear here is that this Majin Bone isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t meant to be a deep or a study case of robotic warriors and such; it's simply an anime created to help sell a card game. And just enough details with its plot to serve the purpose of advertising the cards available, the basic concept, the main characters and future merchandise. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fairly generic with characters representing all the class archetype troupes in anime.\n\nShougo is the classic aloof teenager who grows into being dependable and confident. In contrast, Saho is the oddball supernatural obsessive with a happy personality, she is always wearing a smile. Luke is the stoic leader, Antonio is the eccentric \u00e2\u0080\u009cladies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tyrone represents the polite and respectful character from humble beginnings, but large and strong. Lastly, Luke is the cocky, quarrelsome type. They are all given backstories and real motives and goals. What makes the characters stand out from your typical Yu-Gi-Oh! clones are the voice acting. Having a voicing cast that was able to give a natural and realistic tone with their range. These characters not only sound normal but human as well. With a better script, the dialogue could have been less cringe-worthy at times. \n\nGiving credit where credit is due, Toei Animation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s production team did pretty well for the small budget it was given for Majin Bone. They tried really hard to make a product that punches above its weight. You can see some payoff here when the show has a nostalgic, retro tone with its visuals. The charm comes from its distinctive art style, reminiscent of tokusatsu series of old and complements the limited resources. And while the characters were generic in terms of personalities but their designs were very original and they standout apart from each other and similar shows. Most of the action sequences involving the bone fighters had the heavy use of CG. The designs were impressive, but the action was a bit lacklustre, save it be for a few moments, which were the important ones. In general, the CG made for a stale and unfinished look. With a decent budget, you can easily see how much cooler these sequences, and the anime as a whole, would have been. The OP \"Legend Is Born\" by Kazuki Katou is so good, when you hear \u00e2\u0080\u009cLegend is Born! / Rising! / Shining!\u00e2\u0080\u009d you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but feel pumped.\n\nMajin Bone is a bit of an oddball as its very simple, its lacking and obviously not some A-grade show but I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help be taken in by its charm. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try hard to be something it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t overplay its hand and has a surprisingly solid pace which made the daunting task of completing a 52 episode\u00e2\u0080\u0094an above average-like series\u00e2\u0080\u0094a lot easier and more fun than it should be. It's not something I would recommend but if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a fan of these types of stories and the tokusatsu style then maybe give it a shot."}, {"id": 3958, "score": 64, "body": "It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to properly describe just how absurd Hells is. Much like feelings themselves, this movie is inexplicable, irrational, and borderline unpredictable at times. By that same token, given that it embodies feelings so well, it does an admirable job at being a delightfully earnest film. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s honestly a shame this eye-catcher didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t receive that much attention until now.\n\nOn that note, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start at what drew me in. The art style in this movie is insane! Far removed from the blander or softer art styles present in most anime, this movie showcases rough outlines and keeps the sketching and coloring lines on its characters. This unique style allows for the designers and animators to go all out in constructing the craziest and loveliest character designs, craft a wonderfully vibrant world in Hell, and play around with the rugged linework and imagery in a way that Mob Psycho 100 would gain notoriety for mastering 8 years later. That being said, the anime still decides to use mediocre CG at times and the animation generally feels tamer than the art style. The film\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably not as visually explosive as the team at Studio Madhouse could have made. However, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still one of the most eye-catching anime I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve witnessed to date.\n\nThe other major draw is the dub. Purists may chant for blood at this, but the fact that several members of the abridging juggernaut brand: TeamFourStar, were contacted by Discotek Media to participate in the dub was explosive. The performances in this film were generally good, and some of the adlibs were as priceless as hearing the likes of LittleKuriboh and KaiserNeko as side characters. All in all, the performances were good enough for this risk to be worthwhile and potentially replicated in the future. After all, given how painfully obscure this film is, they had nothing to lose when taking this chance. The performances eclipse most of the soundtrack, with the only exception being the banger of an end credits theme: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBreathe Again\" by Jamosa feat. Sphere.\n\nIt feels rather fitting that they decided to take this risk with such an obscure, dumb, loveable anime. This movie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s infectious charm is rivaled by its own absurdity, constantly turning its own rules and world on their heads in a way that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost impossible to accept. Its messages of love, self-worth, forgiveness, etc. are deeply intertwined to this mess of a narrative. Nothing makes sense, all rules exist to be broken, and believing is what causes the setting to be created and altered constantly. Caution is thrown to the wind by the characters and the script as things simply happen for aforementioned reasons, and sometimes no known reason at all. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all hard to buy. Another reason why it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so messy is that the film is not just blatant about how it utilizes its themes, but as preachy about them as its characters are violent. \n\nSaid characters are generally lacking in any real depth beyond blatantly spelling out their deep-rooted sorrows. Their personalities often range from infectious to grating, and they constantly either stand around for no reason or beat the living shit out of each other. If a film less loveable as this had these qualities, it would be much harder to stomach most of this. However, this is Hells, a brazen, funny, beautiful mess of a film. That means these characters interactions often make up for how weak and shallow they may be upon analysis. \n\nIt's rather fitting that Hells was given this chance. Abandoned by history, this dumb, rambunctious upstart was given a loving license and dub by people who wanted to take a risk and share this with the world. If you like the unique and rough art style, like the kind of humor and writing that the best anime abridgers craft, or like the works of TeamFourStar and would like to see more eventful risks like this in our industry, then please, give this film a shot. It may be a hell of a mess, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but promote. A film as earnest as this deserves all the promotion it can get.\n\nWritten and edited by: CodeBlazeFate\nProofread by: Peregrine"}, {"id": 3968, "score": 53, "body": "Ahh yes, a show that was released in the Fall season of 2018 which most people avoided during the season. Is it worth watching, well let's find out? Spoilers may or may not be in here.\n\nSTORY: 4\nWhen you think of a story, that story should (in theory) go through for the entire season for the story to make sense. Then again, there have been series that doesn't follow through this formula and go the story in only one episode format. A good example of this type of format is Pokemon with most of the plot is for that episode barring a few episodes here and there where it takes place over multiple episodes.\n\nThis series falls into the third category which is to have four different stories set in the world that this series does take place. The problem with this is the fact that other than Merc and Yuu in this short story, none of those really connect with each other in a way that you would think that they are all in the same world. From a story that takes place with fairies to angels that don't want to touch groundlings due to some tarnishing thing, they want no part in is just two of the five stories that this show tries to fit in a 12 episode show. Looking back on it, none of them really stood out to me as my favourite.\n\nANIMATION: 5\nThe animation here is something that isn't completely special that you want to head back and watch just for that alone. This might be because of the fact that the studio who created this (Encourage Films) isn't well known for their animation with properly the most well-known show being Senki Zesshou Symphogear (1st season only) and even still they properly ain't known at all for that.\n\nSOUND: 5\nBoth of the songs that are played at the beginning and the ending of each episode is similar in terms of how good it is. But for me, I prefer the ED as it has a sense of calming with the song that is played as you see Merc and Yuu go through the ending with characters that they meet throughout the show.\n\nThe best song though for the show would have to be the insert in around the two-thirds of the show. For me, I don't why is this the case but compared to the other songs that are in this series, this is properly my favourite of the lot. \n\nCHARACTER: 5\nThere are only two main characters to this. They are Merc and Yuu. Yuu is the male character in this story who at the start of the series is scared of the monsters that are all around the world. Yeah, this would be good to see how he would cope throughout the series, except that it doesn't. Mainly because this arc to say doesn't really exist as he heals the monsters and all that is done and dusted. Another problem is the fact that he could be able to heal them in one turn and not needing to have issues in healing. This wouldn't be an issue for the target audience that is 'kids'. But the fact of the matter is plot armour on his healing skills.\n\nThe other main character in this series is Merc who is a girl that doesn't remember much and is also stuck in a bottle. There isn't anything about where she came from and how she got to that state of mind. Not that it matters here as she is there to guide Yuu on the journey around the place that they called home (even if they have troubles with Episode 10 being an example of that).\n\nThe rest of the cast throughout the series doesn't really have much of a stay throughout the series but this goes back to the episodic format that this series has done in the twelve show run. \n\nENJOYMENT: 6\nAt the end of the day, this show is what is classified as a 'kids show'. Did I enjoy this 'kids show', well I sort of did from the twelve episode run that this had. Yeah, it did have issues in terms of plot progression with not having one story which covers 12 episodes but four different stories. But at the end of the day, I enjoyed the time watching this series from start to finish."}, {"id": 3969, "score": 50, "body": "<div align=\"justify\">_B: The Beginning_ postured to be [Production I.G](https://anilist.co/studio/10/Production-IG)\u00e2\u0080\u0099s return to form.

Already, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve struck at the heart of the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fatal flaw. \n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s indecisive. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what it wants to be. Is it a no-nonsense detective mystery-thriller? Or is it an epic fantasy action piece? The show attempts to be both, unsuccessfully for the most part. This is not to say that these genres are necessarily mutually exclusive. Only that _B: The Beginning_ fails to find an appropriate balance between the two. Through its grounded visual style and heavy dialogue it builds itself up as dark and gritty. But it instead undulates messily between discordant poles, with jarring results.\n\nIn one scene, detectives apply their wit in an attempt to prevent chemical gas from spreading throughout a building. In the next, a member of the Insane Clown Posse __skateboards down a skyscraper__, flinging hand grenades in their wake. ~~What the actual fuck is happening?~~ This tonal dissonance is far too prevalent. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worse is that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intentional. Matters aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t helped by the fact that the the two protagonists occupy parallel story lines that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t intertwine in any way they ideally should. And when these plot lines do overlap, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so utterly contrived it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s funny. Time is therefore split between the two main characters and neither receives the attention they need to make them truly interesting.\n\n~~~webm(https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/5731d522cbff11bc205b26bb63941d26.mp4)~~~\n\nBipolarism and underdeveloped characters aside, there are a still a number of nitpicks to be had. Despite the esoteric literary references and dramatic narration, there is no subtext to be found. Not that there has to be. But all these elements manage to contribute to is the gritty tone (edgy, if you will), which as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve outlined is prone to sudden upending. Furthermore, as opposed to any actual police work, the brilliance of our genius detective is established by way of his ability to sketch portraits using mathematical equations. Similarly, vital exposition is delivered via clunky info dumps. Any major female character exists in order to be damseled. Shortcuts like these are lazy and uninspired, making for a shaky first half of the series. \n\nFortunately, the show picks itself up during its latter half. Here, the mystery element comes to the fore, burgeoning into a genuinely engaging game of cat and mouse. The central villain is a serious force to be reckoned with, and the ensuing battle of wits is good old fashioned high tension fun. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s here where the detective is shown to be cunning in ways beyond mathematical finger painting through his actions and powers of deduction. It helps that the side cast is quite likeable. The fantasy plot kicks into gear too, but simply lacks any weight.\n\n~~~img380(https://i.imgur.com/TvXJJiK.jpg)~~~\n\nIf there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one thing Production I.G can rarely be faulted for, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s there audiovisual design. Crisp, realistic, and dark, _B: The Beginning_ looks like what a sci fi mystery thriller should look like. It's all __really__ pretty. An interesting visual choice is the presentation of the detective\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thoughts via text and mind maps and such superimposed over the screen, _Sherlock_ style. Take that how you will. The action sequences are by no means mind-blowing, but are mostly fun to watch nonetheless. \n\n~~~img380(https://i.imgur.com/UVj2mLS.jpg)~~~\n\nBoth the subbed and dubbed version are fine. Meanwhile, the end credits are fucking amazing.

It lacks focus, thematic or otherwise. It is comprised of two separate story lines that fail to complement each other as they should. Rather, they conflict tonally and in terms of substance matter. They detract from each other and from the show as a whole. I suspect that if the fantasy elements were removed altogether, the show would have improved significantly. Because when the pacing quickened, the mystery story became pretty exciting. With a second season in the works, perhaps the divergent story lines will somehow converge better than they did here.

It was the perfect setting for a series about giant robots that is simply about giant robots doing kickass shit without the need for collateral damage or war-related drama, instead making this effectively sports series about Gunpla fans. So, when we started getting continuations and spinoffs such as Build Fighters Try, and GM no Gyakushuu, we were certainly spoiled for choice in terms of seeing cool new iterations of mobile suits and cool battles involving past suits, but there was always this itch, this craving that we wish would be addressed...\n\nCue Gundam Build Fighters: Battlogue. It advertised itself as this haven for Gundam dream matches akin to the immensely popular Death Battle youtube series. However, as the months went by, that itch started popping up again and we started feeling at least somewhat disappointed by this ONA and what it initially promised us. That is unfortunately this show's biggest failure, even if the action in general is still its biggest success. \n\nFor example: episode 1 is mainly comprised of a simulation where Char Aznable from the Universal Century Timeline, and Ribbons Almark from the Anno Domini Timeline. Both of them operate new machines based on their canonical mobile suits, and this is what we had been wanting all along. Unfortunately, the next 4 episodes all starred Build Fighters characters either battling one another or alongside each other, battling a Perfect Grade Exia (which incidentally marks the first Perfect Grade kit to be featured in the franchise), or weirdly enough, two characters becoming SD Gunpla Bear Magical Girls. The worst part is that these episodes were released monthly, and we only had 5 of them. Just imagine how incredible it would have been do dedicate an episode to a battle between Hiro Yui from Gundam WIng vs Setsuna F. Seiei from Gundam 00, or Kamille Bidan from Zeta Gundam vs Shinn Asuka from SEED Destiny. The possibilities were endless! We could have had episodes like these on occasion (particularly episode 4) to sort of break that up and offer something different on occasion, but understandably, we do feel at least a little cheated, given that the rest of the ONA felt like a bait and switch for he sake of solidifying that this is still a Build Fighters show when it could've easily been Build Fighters characters introducing or even tinkering with these match-ups like in episode 1. Not to mention it also serves as a reminder to many just how annoying and childish the Try characters are (especially given how the actual child characters from the original were more mature), even if we do still get to spend more time with some of the infinitely ore likable Build Fighters characters such as Sei, Kawaguchi, and especially Rinko. Even the Renato brothers are fun, especially with how episode 4 ended.\n\nHowever, the fights we got were still pretty fun to watch, like the Char vs Ribbons fight in episode 1, and the Renato brothers vs Exia and other 00 Units in episode 4. However, the fights certainly aren't as well-animated or as flashy and pulse-pounding as in the original seres, where the sheer impact of the attacks and the emotions and situations of the characters made every battle feel as climactic as a major battle in some of the better Gundam series. A few bad moments aside, these are still fun battles with a few cool new designs, mainly the two Gunpla that battle in episode 5. As a side-note before wrapping things up, the music doesn't have any new additions barring the decent ED and the small track that plays at the beginning and at the teaser post-credits.\n\nSo while we were robbed of the itch-scratching we craved involving these dream matches this show advertised to us, we still got to see some enjoyable battles unfold, for better or worse. It was a bit of a disappointment though, and having some of the old characters back doesn't really fix the issue. It was, if nothing else, an interesting and unique entity in the franchise. Unfortunately, GM no Gyakushuu is without a doubt, the superior of the two main Build Fighters projects that came out this year, if partially because it stuck with what it promised us all the way through."}, {"id": 3990, "score": 57, "body": "Violet Evergarden is an anime...y\u00e2\u0080\u0099know?

I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t call it unenjoyable to watch, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel like there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too much to sink into, despite its attempts at depth. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a perfectly fine, well made drama, and if this brand of crybait is your thing I see no reason to skip over it, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just not really to my taste.\n\nFirst of all, I guess the main thing to discuss here is the visuals, since that is what seems to garner it so much praise on a surface level. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely a Kyoto Animation thing, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very detailed and clearly a lot of care was put into the animation and setting designs. I do personally find the artstyle a bit too polished, it seems too aimed at just being overwhelmingly pretty most of the time, and as a result it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel as a very natural setting, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to get into it a lot of the time. Anyway, the visuals here serve their purpose well enough, having something pretty to look at never hurts.\n\nAs for the actual narrative, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just like...serviceable. I think that the concept of the auto memory doll is pretty unique, if a little easily exploitable within the world itself. I think a bit more attention to detail could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been put into actually describing the mechanics of this career, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a minor complaint.

And overall, I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the strongest part of this show, it achieves its goal of using the tools at its disposal to help Violet reconcile with her past and grow to be a more sympathetic individual. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a solid little character story that was handled just as well as it needs to be.\n\nThat being said, I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily say that qualifies it as an incredible anime in its own right. For one, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find Violet a very compelling main character for a majority of the show, despite her very clear growth. Being an emotionless individual makes it hard to get attached, and while the moments where Violet does learn about herself are rewarding to see, I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say they warmed me up to her too much in the long run, it just felt like an expectation given the narrative at hand. I liked the side characters a lot more (especially Benedict, if only because he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a cutie). All the auto memory dolls are pretty charismatic and fun to see on screen.\n\nThis is an episodic \u00e2\u0080\u009cadventure\u00e2\u0080\u009d show a greater part at the time, in the sense that Violet visits a different client every episode and learns about their traumas and how they handle them, but these more episodic stories weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t all that interesting to me. It seems like a lot of it just boils down to \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bad thing happening to good people\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and it expects me to feel bad as a result. There just isn't enough characterization or reason to care put into these people. In the end, the stories really aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that inspired or original, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stuff I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen before and done better.  Like, the episode that I liked the most was the one with the mom that wrote all the letters to her daughter, and even then, the first thing it reminded me of was an Animal Crossing tearjerker thing I used to like back in middle school. Maybe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just a cold-hearted cynic, but I find it really hard to get invested into these kinds of overly sappy bits of drama that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have much subtlety or any intention but to make me feel emotional. It just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work. To this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s credit, I do think that the events are worthy of the pathos that is assigned to them, more than many of the more pointlessly melodramatic Kyoto Animation works (here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s looking at you, Hibike Euphonium).\n\nAnd then this overarching story with Gilbert and his brother and the war and whatever is, again, serviceable, not all that interesting. I guess an element of it is that fantasy politics is the most uninteresting thing in the world to me already, so having that be an element of the show is just an automatic point of disinterest (granted, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take much prominence, but it is relevant to the plot regardless, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just not an interesting world regardless of my tastes). It's good context for Violet and, again, it's fine but doesn't feel all that inspired.\n\nSo I guess I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll keep this review relatively brief. The show is fine. It has a clear goal in mind and achieves it sufficiently. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well put together and a solid character study, even if it is a bit too focused on selling the emotional tone rather than actually constructing something interesting.

You never get an explanation and the story... well there isn't one? I'm not sure. The main character is the weakest person in the entire show, that being said the \"strongest\" the leader of zvezda absolutely needs his \"power\" which again is never explained and also doesn't exist. Almost every episode will have a battle scene where every enemy is a storm trooper that wen't to \"the academy of bullets that only hit the ground\" not only do enemies never hit there target but the battle always ends the same, zvezda pulls out some Super secret weapon, or ability, or robot, or new character, or... anything that can be explained by \"that's the power of zvezda!\". The characters never develop (Well maybe the main character finally realizes that he actually thinks thoughts and has a brain) and the plot never appears, we just get told that the world is going to be conquered, even that's a lie. I gave this show a 6/10 because I enjoyed the art and the different characters to an extent but most of all it was because I shipped Asuta and Renge. Too bad Asuta want's the loli that does nothing but use him instead, gotta appeal to the lolicons I guess otherwise this show would have been rated a 2/10 overall. There's not a lot of good points to make about this anime. if you like random no point anime shows then this is for you, if you like a plot, good character progression, or a reason other than \"this might look cool\", then this show isn't for you. I thought this anime could have potential at the start so I kept watching but in the end it was just a boring ending where they \"win\" and go back to fighting more enemies to conquer the world. I was hoping that maybe in the end that Kate finished her goal and evaporated and left Renge and Asuta together but sadly it goes on. As a quick side not I might actually enjoy this anime if literally ANYTHING was explained but nothing ever was. This show might have taken a spot for one of my lowest rated shows if it wasn't saved by the fact that Renge is probably the best clueless character right after anyone else trying to hide there identity in this show."}, {"id": 4016, "score": 60, "body": "__Fate Apocrypha, missed potential, a spoiler-included review.__\n<a href=\"https://imgbb.com/\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/DPXVjjj/download.jpg\" alt=\"download\" border=\"0\"></a><br /><a target='_blank' href='https://aluminumsulfate.net/uses-of-aluminum-sulfate'></a><br />\n\nThis is the first of the Fate series that i have watched ~~I was definitely not baited by Astolflo~~. I enjoyed it, but as a story and how it flows, I have a huge problem with its progression. Also, this is my first review, so cut me some slack yeah?\n\n\n____\n1.     __The first half is literally a game of cat and mouse with nothing achieved from it.__\nA common trend that I realized in Fate Apocrypha is that a lot of episodes tend to end up with one character saying _\"Next time we fight, we're gonna end this once and for all!\"_ Yes, while I understand that while it is to ensure that the final episodes have a massive final fight, but seeing Assassin bail after a fight or seeing Shiro call back his servants while being a \"tactical move\" in context of a Holy Grail War, makes each episode tiring to watch as the viewer knows that not all the servants are going to die until the final fight.\n\n __2. Fight Scenes come across as glorified light shows with no real depth\n__ \n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/C6BQWkD\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/FX6znSC/DzMmTR8.jpg\" alt=\"DzMmTR8\" border=\"0\"></a><br /><a target='_blank' href='https://aluminumsulfate.net/uses-of-aluminum-sulfate'></a><br />\nFight scenes involve a lot of  laser beams and sword explosions that seem like it came out of a Michael Bay film. In the Sieg vs Karna fight in Episode 22 that while being amazing to see, ultimately boiling down to _Which servant has the largest laser beam to destroy their opponent?_ . A number of fights in the show boil down to just a show of power, whereas it would be more interesting to see how a character uses their skills at their disposal to outwit their opponent based on their character. Fights, like Mordred's final fight against Semiramis is resolved by Modred's master using a command spell plus drugs to boost her power, which just seems like a easy way out to resolve a fight.\n\n__3. Characters are poorly made and are shallow.__\nThis is a massive gripe I have with the show, considering that it made me almost want to drop it. Its understandable that in a 25 episode span, it is tough to fully cover all the servants and masters, their motivations and characters, but even the main cast are just... ack. \n- Spartacus is a prime offender of this, serving no real purpose in the story other than being a destructive force that is but a hindrance to the characters. \n-Avicebron's desire to \"create the perfect golem to create paradise\" is out of place, and his episode where he dies for the golem serves no purpose in the entire episode other than even out the fight between the Red and Black faction.\n- Karna, despite being one of the characters who had so much screen time, especially near the end, did not have much depth other than being an extremely powerful servant who has a heart of gold.\n- Celenike (Rider's former master) is a sadistic woman who gets off torturing Astolflo in her Victorian torture chamber, which was pretty unnecessary and her being taken out of the Holy Grail War \n- Not to mention characters like Roche, Darnic, who had no effect on the story other than being plot drivers, which in that case they're better off not existing and that screen time spent on developing the others. \n\n__HOWEVER,__\nI especially enjoyed the dynamics of some characters, especially Mordred and Sisigou's, Achilles and Chiron's rivalry was more interesting than Jeanne and Sieg's romance, which wasn't very emotionally engaging and I did not get invested nor did I care about the end. Mordred, despite having little screen time, had a better development, wherein her wish to become King, as well as her hatred for Artoria is challenged and culminates into her realizing that she just wanted to help her father and relieve her burden.\n\n__4. The conflict of ideals could have been so much better.__\nThe examination of the dilemma between achieving salvation at the cost of human individuality and removing the entire point of living/experiencing the human condition could have been more interesting should it have been more well developed. Amakusa Shirou's desire for salvation against Jeanne's wish to ensure that humans experience life, regardless whether they suffer despair under evil while seeing the good appear in others is a good concept, but wasted by poor execution with exposition, with the characters debating in the last episodes about their ideals when it should have been explored throughout the series. Amakusa Shirou acted as a shadowy figure in the beginning, only appearing in the second half to take over the faction of red.\n\nMaybe I'm rambling, but ultimately Fate Apocrypha had potential to explore themes of the human condition, or the characters that were much more interesting such as Mordred or the other masters, instead of Sieg, who is arguably a boring MC who took up too much screen time."}, {"id": 4032, "score": 50, "body": "The gods can be quite cruel. For our unnamed protagonist, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as if unseen forces, far greater than himself, have conspired against him. What he wants is a simple, peaceful life; however, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forced to watch as that door is slammed shut by a vicious twist of fate. Having no other option, our protagonist turns to organized crime. After he acknowledges the situation he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in, he resolves to make the most of it. His efforts, though, are rooted in humble beginnings. At first, our protagonist is little more than a performer of menial tasks, an errand boy for his superiors, and a victim to their whims. However, this doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t last for long. By relying on a combination of confidence, ruthlessness, and ingenuity, our unnamed protagonist ascends the ranks, earning the higher-up\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trust, as his sights turn towards the top of the food chain\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\nStories like this fascinate me. Mobster movies represent a darker rendition of the typical \u00e2\u0080\u009crags to riches\u00e2\u0080\u009d tale, where sentimental value is replaced by realism. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re like most underdog-driven narratives, but with characters you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always cheer for and ideas you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always support. This is the genre that Sanctuary, Studio Pastel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 1996 film, finds itself in. Almost from the start, Sanctuary tries separating itself from the others through its heavily political focus. As you would expect, the film chronicles a mobster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rise to power but it also connects this to a larger plotline concerning favoritism. Sanctuary intends to criticize a system that only enables celebrities, bureaucrats, and children of older politicians to advance. Because he despises this practice, the film\u00e2\u0080\u0099s protagonist wants to undermine this system through his mobster influence. Along the way, Sanctuary forms several parallels between the political sphere and the criminal underworld, arguing that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re equally corrupt.\n\nUnfortunately, these ideas are overshadowed by a director whose vision is trapped inside mobster movie cliches. Characters lounge around and reminisce about old times under shimmering streetlights. Plot details are discussed inside lavish nightclubs and high-rise skyscrapers. Saxophones, pianos, and bass guitars supply the score for a string of sex scenes. The end result is a film that aspires for social commentary but fails to offer anything beyond the glitz and glamour and guns.\n\nActually, you can ignore the guns. Sure, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re waved around quite a bit but the guns are never used. At no point in the film is anyone in any real danger, especially not Hojo. As Sanctuary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s protagonist, he provides cigarettes and a comb-over to his role but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s his unwavering confidence that truly defines him. Hojo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s confidence is portrayed to ridiculous extremes. In a crucial scene during Sanctuary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latter half, an employer of his requires him to partake in a test of loyalty. As part of the test, Hojo has to stab his hand with a knife without flinching. He not only pulls off the stunt but he also does so with a self-assured smirk; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obvious that even this test has failed to penetrate his air of confidence. The scene serves as a microcosm of Hojo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall character. No matter what obstacle he faces (whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the police, the corrupt politicians, his deranged older brother, or the mob boss), he not only overcomes them but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also completely unfazed by the threat they pose. Because Sanctuary is unwilling to present Hojo with a legitimate challenge, what results is a series of conflicts that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just unengaging but predictable as well. By itself, the lack of dramatic tension is damning material. However, this is merely part of a larger issue with the film.\n\nEarlier, I described the mobster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rise to power and why I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m fascinated by it. However, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a concept that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m far more interested in: the fall from grace. Our unnamed protagonist has arrived at the summit but he won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be there for long. Thanks to fame\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trappings, the same traits that fueled his success have changed for the worse. His confidence morphs into arrogance. His ruthlessness swells to surreal heights. And his ingenuity evaporates. Eventually, after burning enough bridges, our protagonist is reduced to nothing. A journey to the mountaintop can be entertaining; however, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s falling from that same mountaintop that really resonates with me. Personally speaking, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s captivating to watch someone claw and scratch to attain the finer things in life (fancy suits, fast cars, and high-priced cigars), only for it all to instantly vanish. Ultimately, the mobster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fall from grace serves as a cautionary tale for members of organized crime; what it does is present the consequences of the lifestyle they lead.\n\nWith Sanctuary, though, there is no fall from grace. Matter of fact, there aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any consequences here whatsoever.\n\nTake Sakura Shuichi, for instance. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a sleazy, sewer-dwelling rat that forces himself upon random women. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a politician affiliated with the National Diet of Japan. So, naturally, when Hojo begins blackmailing Sakura with photos of his misdeeds, he is warned by the mob boss himself to stop. Hojo, however, insists on playing with fire. He tosses log after log into the flames, delighting in the disaster he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s made, before eventually deciding to pour a gallon of oil into the mix. Instead of being disciplined for his reckless behavior, Hojo receives a promotion. For another example, you can refer to Kyoko Ishihara, the police force\u00e2\u0080\u0099s superintendent. When she tries to infiltrate a mobster-owned casino, Kyoko is quickly discovered by Hojo, who drugs and rapes her. He suffers no repercussions from this; in fact, through a mind-boggling turn of events, Kyoko ends up helping him resist a group of kidnappers. Looking at the bigger picture, Hojo decides to become a mobster (or, in this case, a yakuza) and is never faced with the consequences of his choice. When you combine this with the lack of dramatic tension, what remains is a protagonist whose plot armor is powerful enough to neutralize anything, even the after-effects of his own actions.\n\nBy glamorizing its subject matter, Sanctuary falls victim to the same aches and pains that plagues every other dime-a-dozen mobster flick. It constructs a narrative of watered-down stereotypes, forgettable encounters, and incomplete character arcs. This film has no real identity, nothing that separates it from the herd, which is exactly why I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend it to fans of the genre. If you happen to enjoy mobster movies, Sanctuary provides pretty much everything you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d expect from its category. Thing is, there was a spark of potential here. At first, the film wanted to take risks with its material but Sanctuary ends up playing it safe."}, {"id": 4051, "score": 65, "body": "#Love is hard for otaku review.\n\nMy thoughts about this series are mediocre.

Crimes are instantly solved when Zhang Dabao looks at a crime scene which activates his ability to instantly solve a crime by just looking at a crime scene, this  renders any of the mystery and intrigue behind the crime obsolete.\n\nMost of the culprits and antagonists in the stories are fairly one dimensional and characterless. The one antagonist that is slightly interesting only appears at the end of the show and the conflict between him and Zhang Dabao is foreshadowed at the end of the show and promised for the next season (if there is going to be a season 2, which seems unlikely. \n\nThe show would be considerably worse if not for the character of Zhang Dabao. What makes Zhang Dabao character so appealing is two sides of his character that are balanced fairly well. On one side is the idiotic, clueless and socially awkward Zhang Dabao and on the other side is a decisive and heroic Zhang Dabao. That first side of him is portrayed in a way that makes his character more endearing than annoying like other dumb main characters. This is also helped by a good performance by his voice actor. Zhang Dabao is a simple character but his desire to help others and rush headlong in danger for others makes it hard not to like him. His character is well symbolized by the nearly identical captain america logo on his shirt.\n\nimg1000(https://i.imgur.com/L3V6Bsg.png)\n\nZhang Dabao\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship with Tang Jing is the one of the main aspects of the show and is the main way that the story does and will progress. Tang Jing is a fairly standard damsel in distress character but there is not a completely generic character with her feelings for her ex boyfriend providing enough potential intrigue for the relationship between her and Zhang Dabao. \n\nThe one other aspect that the show does fairly well is the relationship between Zhang Dabao and Egg. The dialogue flows quite naturally and provides the few jokes that the show has. Both Zhang Dabao and Egg show there selflessness for each other at certain times during the show. \n\nTechnically the show is typical of most other Chinese works. The art is quite simple and bland and the animation is quite jankie and poor. The show also struggles to get the perspective right is some shots that make it look poorly made.

Because of the heavy content, I would say this anime is not for the faint of heart - though I would not call it overly suspenseful per se. It has elements of horror, but morbid curiosity is the factor that will inexorably draw you, the viewer, and the characters deeper and deeper into the story. From the beginning the anime presents compelling impossibilities and mysteries you do not yet have the clues to solve. Throughout, it is...disturbingly imaginative.\n\nThe main character is am agnostic high-schooler who rushes to write summaries of alleged occult happenings on his cheap blog for clicks and popularity. He is neither open nor closed to the supernatural until the supernatural intrudes on his life and he steps straight into the scene of a gruesome murder and follows the instructions of an unknown voice seemingly contacting him through radio waves. As events go on, it becomes increasingly clear that nothing is really as it seems.\n\nYou should be aware that the content is disturbingly violent in many places. The title itself should tell you that yes, the occult is involved, but that will not necessarily warn you of some other related concepts: an underage serial killer with a strange box, a quasi-New Religion conspiracy, mass hypnotism, a barrage of occult and pseudo-science, fortune-telling, witchcraft, uncertain states of death, and uncomfortably large boobs (though to the animators\u00e2\u0080\u0099 credit, they are not oversexualized beyond their extraordinary size and one obligatory Marshmallow Hell gag).\n\n_Occultic;Nine_ does end rather abruptly. The climax is narratively satisfying, but it does not concretely answer questions about the fate of certain characters. It left me with a somewhat uneasy, unfinished feeling.

It's not that they wouldn't talk to him but he just didn't want to associate himself with these bad influences. However when they DID come by to ask questions/talk they were always nice and considerate and Chad would always struggle to speak coherently. Only ever responding to their questions. This always embarrassed Chad because he didn't want people to pity him but at the same time it did give some popularity of being that one loner so people would talk to him out of pity. Oops this is getting a little sad... errrr... yeah so he would cope by masturbating to hentai and that made him very happy. Wait, is that funny? \n\n(Sidenote: Chad did have a reason for his lack of social skills. It's not an excuse and it didn't give him social anxiety but it did encourage this behavior. I point this out because the anime didn't give any specific reason for tomoko's social anxiety. She just kind of had it at the start. I'm not a doctor but I guess people could naturally have social anxiety, however I believe there are usually some factors that lead them to this lifestyle. It doesn't have to be anything substantial but some background would be nice. I suppose some would point out that she's addicted to surfing the internet and playing video games but i would like to know why. What encouraged her to do this? Her brother (Tomoki) loves video games too it seems yet he has plenty of friends. What makes them different?)\n\nChad then one day found this neet anime called \"No Matter How I Look at It, It's You Guys' Fault I'm Not Popular!\" and he realized just how much he could relate to the main character. Cause that's all this anime has going for it. However Chad really hated Tomoko. She was very unlikable for many reasons such as: cheating, perversions, egotism, and plain idiocy. Still when Chad put himself in her shoes he wondered \"what would I do?\", and came to the conclusion \"Not this cringy Shit\". Then he would feel better about himself and years later write an anime review on it to post on the internet for the whole 2 people to read. Wait a minute.\n\nIn all seriousness the enjoyment in Watamote will completely hinge on how you view Tomoko. This review sums up her character and if you didn't like what you read then this is not for you. I also want to point out chad's a story of a real person with real anxiety. I point this out because you may have a story like this and if so then maybe look into this anime. You may like it, you may not. Chad certainly didn't, especially the main character. However it did allow him to reflect on his not-so-proud past. Tomoko can be hard to watch at times and maybe it's not at that level but i'm sure we've all had those moments we want to redo. I believe that's the point, Chad hates Tomoko because he hates his past and if you don't learn from the past your doomed to repeat it. That's how it works, right? Anyway enough with the half-assed morals, I hope this review helped.\n\nI also real quick want to mention some side characters:\n\n- Tomoki - Tomoko's brother who has friends and always looks a bit cynical\n\n- Yu - Tomoko's hot, trendy yet very friendly best friend from middle school\n\n- Megumi - Best girl who Tomoko doesn't deserve but goddammit that final scene with her was precious!\n\nAnd a few others. All these character are in stark contrast to Tomoko herself and I guess provide an interesting dynamic to the anime. (Not really, all she does is annoy her brother and perv the other two girls.)\n\nSo with all that said what do i give this anime? A solid 5/10! Balanced, as all things should be.\nHowever (A lot of \"however\" in this review) I go by the smiley face rating system in my anime list and i gave this anime a very happy smiley face. The reason for this is because I appreciate anime that approach issues like these even if i end up disliking it. I don't want to give it anything less than what i deem necessary. Also that scene with Megumi, ____Precious.____\n"}, {"id": 4060, "score": 67, "body": "L\u00e2\u0080\u0099histoire est centr\u00c3\u00a9e sur deux coll\u00c3\u00a8gues, Nicolas et Worick, \u00c3\u00a9voluant dans la ville d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Ergastulum en tant qu\u00e2\u0080\u0099hommes \u00c3\u00a0 tout faire.

With First Squad, the project was done in conjunction with Japanese animation studio Studio 4C and a Russian company Molot Entertainment. Molot Entertainment doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to have done much else besides First Squad besides another animated film called Ivan about a post-apocalyptic world filled with magical creatures such as dragons From what I can find, the company seems to be focused on helping promote independent projects.\n\nFirst Squad itself seems to have an interesting history by itself. Starting out as a music video in 2005 by both Studio 4C and Molot Entertainment, with the song for the music video done by MC Ligalize. It even won an award at the MTV Russian Music Awards for best hip-hop video in 2006. By 2007, the Russian studio behind the music video announced that they were working on a film adaptation of the music video.\n\n2 years later, First Squad: Moment of Truth was released to the public. Apparently, is was well received enough in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home country of Russia that it even went on to win an award by the Kommersant newspaper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prize. There was even a graphic novel adaptation the year after First Squad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s release. So with the surprisingly interesting history of First Squad out of the way, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s have a closer look at it.\n\nSet during World War II on the Eastern Front, a group of Nazi mystics plan to resurrect Baron von Wolff and his Teutonic Knights during the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMoment of Truth\u00e2\u0080\u009d, a moment that has appeared throughout various points in time that will determine the outcome of any significant conflict. To prevent this, Division Six of the Soviet Military intelligence has enlisted a group of young people with special abilities to fight the invading German armies and prevent the Nazi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s from reaching their goal.\n\nThe story follows a young clairvoyant girl named Nadya, who survived a deadly air raid attack only to be left shell-shocked. While recovering from her concussion, she soon discovers that she has a new ability, the ability to foresee said \u00e2\u0080\u009cMoments of Truth\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Soon, she is taken into Division Six, and is trained along with the rest of the rest of the squad to prevent the Moment of Truth from being used by the Nazis to win the war.\n\nUnfortunately the whole movie is a bit of a mixed bad. While the premise is great, the rest of the movie is a bit underwhelming. The fact that this movie is only an hour long is the thing that unfortunately drags this whole thing down. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to assume that the team behind First Squad not having a bigger budget, not having enough time, or not having both is the reason that the length of this movie is so short. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how much better it would have been having an extra 15 minutes, but I feel like the whole thing would have definitely felt a lot smoother.\n\nAs a side effect of the length of this movie, the characters don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always get the character development they need. Nadya pretty much gets most of it because she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the main character, but the rest of the characters only get the most minor of character development, something that could have been solved with a longer length. The few action scenes that this movie gets are just OK, nothing to write home about.\n\nThere is actually two versions of First Squad. A \u00e2\u0080\u009cTheatrical\u00e2\u0080\u009d cut and a \u00e2\u0080\u009cDirector\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u009d cut.The only difference between both versions is every now an again in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cDirector\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u009d cut there are a brief interviews done with veterans, historians, and other live actors in between the rest of the movie. These are basically just here to not only try and lengthen the movie with the meager budget they had, but these are more of a mixed bag than anything. Some of them don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really add anything, such as the one interview that simply explains what sedatives are.\n\nMaybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to give it some authenticity, but considering that the whole thing flows much better without them, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really recommend the \u00e2\u0080\u009cDirector\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u009d cut unless you found something about the original interesting enough to warrant something more.\n\nFirst Squad: Moment of Truth might be a rocky in terms of quality, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really hate it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not something you should immediately go out and see, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth checking out if you some free time and it looks interesting to you."}, {"id": 4082, "score": 55, "body": "(This review has been reposted from my review of Akame Ga Kill! posted on MyAnimeList)\nAkame Ga Kill! is a story about a young man named Tatsumi who travels to the capital of his nation in order to try and earn money for his starving village. However, after his arrival, it seems the capital is more twisted and full of despair than Tatsumi ever could have imagined. He ends up joining a team of assassins called Night Raid, a group whose purpose is to rid the capital of its corruption and turn a new leaf in the despairing nation.\nI really enjoyed watching Akame Ga Kill. It was a fun ride with fun characters, fun battles, and a setting that's well imagined and shown. It has many strengths, but I do believe that it falls short in some of what it has and what it could have done.\n\nTo start, I would like to talk about the setting, premise, and overall direction of the show. Akame Ga Kill makes it very clear what you're gonna be dealing with from the get-go and follows through with it to the end. Aside from a large amount of gore and violence, one thing the show does a good job of communicating is the setting we're in. The anime does an excellent job of painting how corrupt the capital is under its minister's reign. It shows how things are connected, how the public is being manipulated and abused, and how an uprising has been so hard to do. As Night Raid dispatches foe after foe, we get to see each one's unique weapons and powers as as well as the corrupt and sick things they've been doing to find themselves on Night Raid's hit list. These battles are also nice demonstrations of the heroes' abilities, as well as emotional moments for the characters. The show makes it very clear it isn't afraid to kill off a character we've grown close to, and it communicates very clearly that no assassin is safe from the job of killing they've burdened themself with. The fight scenes, though the animation can feel lackluster and a bit lazy at some points, is overall satisyfing, as what carries it through is each character's abilities and strengths clashing against each other.\n\nThis leads me to the next thing I would like to talk about: the characters. Each character has a memorable design and personality, and their distinct features, differences from each other, and abilities help make each member of Night Raid memorable. The chemistry between the characters, for the most part, is well established throughout the show, and we get to see how well these assassins are connected, which helps make their deaths all the more emotional for both their fellow friends as well as the viewer. However, I do have some problems with our heroes. For one, lots of them don't exactly have the most original personality or character archetype. Lots of them follow specific anime tropes that have been long overused, such as the tsundere character, the onee-san character, the pervert, the kuudere, the overly heroic protagonist man, and so on. They do make good use of these for the most part, and each character will definitely stick with me for a while, but I would be lying if I didn't say a large portion of their memorability comes from their character designs, which are not exactly outstanding, but do a nice job representing the character and making each one distinctly stand out in the crowd. Another problem I have is with some of the dialogue. Here's a fun drinking game: take a shot every time Mine explains how her gun works. Chances are, you'll be wasted by episode 10. The audience is treated like idiots through a good portion of the anime, and this is made very clear from the character's dialogue and exposition. Rather than let the audience figure out the situation for themselves, the characters feel the need to state in an out-of-place manner the blatantly obvious, and exposition scenes happen in almost every episode. They did an alright job of keeping me entertained with the visuals, but the dialogue became fairly irritating every so often. It's definitely a problem that's hard to miss. Finally, before moving on, I want to talk about character development. Lots of the characters have very clear motivations, and some characters have their lives cut short before they can fulfill their dreams, which does help to make their demises more painful. However, lots of characters especially seem to lack development. I think Esdeath's elite assassin team could have definitely had more development, which could have been fixed as easily as introducing them later. It would have been so much more interesting, and you would have had a much more powerful emotional resonance with the the characters and an audience member It also would've made some certain showdowns with other characters way more emotionally impactful and less one-sided, but I'd like to stay away from spoilers as much as possible. One character, in particular, I would like to address is Akame. Both the title of the show as well as the openings and endings highlight her in particular, so you would think her being the protagonist of the show is a safe bet. However, she gets significantly less screentime than you would expect, and instead, the show probably should have been called Tatsumi Ga Kill! as most of the show clearly follows Tatsumi's journeys and interactions, many of which do not include Akame in the slightest. Akame is also one of the main characters with the least development in the entire show. It does a good job of establishing her past and relationship with certain characters, but Akame ends up being a pretty static character throughout her time in the show.\n\nNow, I would like to talk about the atmosphere and tone of the show, which I think it handles nicely. The constant themes of death and violence are prominently present and never forgotten about, and, as I stated before, the show does a great job at nailing how the empire is in a state of despair and horror. The show manages to accomplish lots of the tones through its soundtrack, which is not outstanding or exceptional, but does a great job for adding another layer of depth to the battle scenes or otherwise, whether it's a tense or despair-filled moment, the music helps set the mood very well. The visuals and animations are about average, the fight scenes sometimes feeling like our vision is restricted so the animators have to do less work, but are overall interesting enough. A neat touch during some scenes of the show is this unique art style, one that really emphasizes the characters and their emotions, which are oftentimes delusion or hatred. It doesn't appear as much as I would personally like, but it definitely helps add some layer of uniqueness to scenes, though whether you like it or not is completely up to you, I personally enjoy the touch. One sizeable complaint I have about the show's themes presented, however, relates to the stupid-audience treatment I mentioned earlier. The show bashes you over the head over and over with its themes, and it would take a complete idiot not to take away something the show is trying to say about killing and the work and struggles the characters go through. Fights and dialogue give a nice shoving down the throat of these themes, and the show definitely could have taken a more subtle approach to this. Something that contrasts almost everything I've mentioned, however, is the show's humor. Throughout the series, the characters are cracking jokes fairly often, which debatably breaks the atmosphere, but I feel it helps make the character interactions feel more natural, though I agree it definitely could have been toned down in some places where the darker themes of the show should have taken the spotlight. For that matter, the show definitely could have had a more grounded and gritty feel to it with both the art style and color choices, which in the actual product are fairly standard, and it would have accompanied the atmosphere much of the show goes for very well in my opinion. The humor would definitely have to be more grounded and/or toned down if that were the case, and the show would have a much different feel to it, but I think it would've worked nicely. However, that's just my personal opinion, and you don't have to agree with me.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed watching Akame Ga Kill. I loved the characters, and the premise and battles will stick with me for some time. Despite its many flaws, there are a good amount of things the show does well, and I think the problem is less what it did wrong and more what it could've done better. Overall, I would rate Akame Ga Kill! a solid 6/10, and I would recommend it to someone not necessarily looking for something outstanding but a very fun ride (and someone who can handle gore of course).

Subtitles are rated but not included in the final score.\n\nI was having problems deciding how to  score this movie, and how to include both bad and good parts.

Understanding this review will require general knowledge of Love Live!

There where several nonsensical parts, similar to the end of Season 2 of Sunshine. What I enjoyed was the execution, the characters are very captivating and can kind of hide the non working plot and convince you of the power of School Idols being what holds reality together, otherwise there would be no way to overlook the huge amount of plotholes.\n\n--------------------------------------\nVisuals: 7/10\n\nThere where lots of good shots, the art style wasn't super refined but absolutely ok. Background characters looked a lot better than in previous instances. Facial expressions and eyes were excellent. Light and bloom effects looked ok. But there is still one big concern in all idol animes we have not talked about yet: 3D models.I found the quality of the 3D models wildy inconsistent this time around. Therefore I will go into detail on this in the \"Performances\" section.\n\n--------------------------------------\nAnimations: 9/10\n\nWe are talking about the movement of characters here, not image quality. I felt that Animation and expressiveness of the characters were excellent. Everything looked fluid and arguably realistic. At no point was I disappointed by the way characters moved. This movie had no fast action scenes, which are normally the best way to detect animation flaws.\n\n--------------------------------------\nSongs/Performances: 8/10\n\nAn idol anime rises and falls with it's songs and performances. There were 5 perfomances and a vocal insert song/montage by all of Aquors.\n\nFirst Performance: Bokura was Hashitte kita Michi...\nMembers: All 9\nCenter: Chika\nTopic: A song about continuing Aquors even after the third years leave. End with Chika having a Solo and the Center.\n\nSong: +\nOutfits: o\nAnimation: o\nModels: - - -\nRating: 4/10\n\nSecond Performance: Tousou Meisou Moebius Loop\nMembers: Dia, Mari, Kanan\nCenter: -\nTopic: A song about running away from PLOTHOLE.

And the movie only made it worse. So I decided to kinda count.\n\nCharacters by lines:\nChika > Ruby > Mari >> Yohane >> Riko > Tsuki(You's cousin) > You >Kanan > Dia > Hanamaru\n\nThe first three probably had as many lines as the rest combined. But that is not the only problem, if we look at only important lines, lines that progress the story or a character, we get.\n\nCharacters by important lines:\nChika > Ruby > Mari >> Riko > Tsuki(You's cousin) > Kanan > You > 0 = Dia = Hanamaru = Yohane\n\nThis is __NOT JOKE__, in my opinion Dia, Hanamaru and Yohane said exactly 0 lines that contributed anything. Furthermore You now falls behind Kanan. Yohanes only lines were Dark Angel related, Hanamarus Food and Dias dotting on her sister.\n\nThe distribution of importance is just disgraceful.\n\n--------------------------------------\nCharacter development: 2/10\n\nCharacters that had development shown:\nRuby, Leah, Shiitake, Mari?\n\nCharacters that probably had development, but not shown:\nMari's Mom, 1st and 2nd years.\n\nShoutout to Kanan for being as stale as wet cement.\n\n--------------------------------------\nOutfits: 8/10\n\nChika: - -\nYou: o\nRiko: +\nRuby: ++\nHanamaru: ++\nYohane: +++\nDia: ++\nMari: +++\nKanan: - -\nLeah: ++\nSarah: ++\nTsuki: +\n\nYohane was soooo cute. Mari looks great in leather. Kanan looked like she robbed homeless for her clothes. Chika took the stuff even Kanan wouldn't steal from the Homeless. Turns out, stripper outfits are hot.\n\n--------------------------------------\nHair: 8/10\n\nChika: -\nYou: +\nRiko: +\nRuby: ++\nHanamaru: ++\nYohane: +++\nDia: ++\nMari: o\nKanan: o\nLeah: +\nSarah: +\nTsuki: o\n\nDid I already mention how cute Yohane looked? Dia had a High Ponyttail, very nice. Hanamaru rocked tradditional braids + glasses.\n\n--------------------------------------\nComedy: 9/10\n\nThe humor is really on point. A mix of references, slapstick, witty retorts and sticky sitations left the cinema laughing every few minutes.\n\n\n--------------------------------------\nGerman subtitles: 0/10\n\nThere were huge amounts of typos. Aquors where always referenced with an article, the Aquors instead of Aquors. Fontsize was small and not very well stylized. The story ocassionally made no sense, details seem to have been omitted. Weird punctuation appears out of nowhere.\n\n\n\nSummary and final Score: 6/10\n\nIn total, I found the movie amusing and entertaining, but if I look any deeper than the absolute surfce it falls apart. I would certainly watch it again, but I would prefer to be slightly drunk. The songs and performances are great but the rest is clearly below average. Some characters got shafted, AGAIN. I really can't stand seeing Chika anymore. This leads me to give it: 6/10"}, {"id": 4085, "score": 52, "body": "# [~~~**This review will contain Spoilers for the show!**~~~]()\n<br>\nDARLING in the FRANXX starts off really strong. Taking quite a bit of its time to set up the world, the characters, and they plot that would ensue.\nBut sadly it falls flat right after episode 15, all of the character development and world building is meaningless. Let me tell you why!\n\n\n[**_(SPOILER AHEAD)_ STORY:**]()\nLets summarise the story first. The show focuses on Hiro, a young lad, during his olden' days he used to be \"prodigy\" among his peers. He was very excited to become a FRANXX pilot and defeat the very nasty \"Klaxosaurs\", everyone had faith in him.\n\nThat did not last, Hiro managed to fail his aptidute test. He later become very unmotivated and depressed, until he met a horn wearing pink hair lady (the seasonal waifu that is still kicking to this day). She was very infamous, everyone called her \"Partner Killer\" (her code being 002 or just \"ZeroTwo\"), everyone who rode with her sustained serious injuries until they died.\n\nHiro being the little hormone filled teen decided to ride with her, of course he sustained some damage but not as much as the previous pilots. Hiro was once again filled with determination. Later on we find out why this is the case, when Hiro was a young fella he found ZeroTwo in her prison like room. He decided it was a good idea to break her out of there. ZeroTwo got a cut from the escape and Hiro, being the stupid little kid he was, decided to suck the blood out. That blood infused with his and made him more like the \"monster\" she was. With every fight scene present we could see Hiro taking more and more damage until he too had horns.\n\nRight until that point we got to see the plot expanding in very interesting ways, the characters were learning more and more about the world before the \nKlaxosaurs showed up. Everything told me that the ending to this show was going to be strong and worth the wait. yeahhhh not what happened.\n\nWe were sent to **SPACE** to fight **ALIENS** that were \"controling\" humans. This part is where the story took a nose dive in quality. The choices and the things they learned had basically no impact, it was a series on its own. The ending was especially bad with Hiro and ZeroTwo wondering the space time after \"dying\", this made for a very flat ending that did not do the show any kind of justice.\n~~~img420(https://thumbs.gfycat.com/SophisticatedWickedDanishswedishfarmdog-max-1mb.gif)~~~\n<br>\n\n\n[**CHARACTERS:**]()\nThe show had several interesting and lovable characters.\nEach and everyone has their own quirks; Hiro is depressed, Ichigo is a b**ch, ZeroTwo broke the \"Seasonal Waifu\" definition. (not gonna name every character).\n\nThey all live together, we can see a lot of interactions between them all. A lot of them were interesting and gave us insight into their personalities. Others were just... yeah.\n\nAll in all, I liked **_MOST_** of the characters present, pretty much the only one I had issue with was Ichigo. She just wouldn't stop hating on best girl ZeroTwo, even after she changed her mind and turned a bit okay she was still the worst.\n~~~img420(https://66.media.tumblr.com/9b8bf55d6540779319818a4c66da1d17/tumblr_p3l5zp3LbT1v1hotuo1_400.gif)~~~\n<br>\n\n\n[**ART/ANIMATION:**]()\nThis show had really good animation and the art style was also very neat. \n\nOf course I wouldn't call this anything ground breaking. It was very nice on the eye.\nThe colour pallete was very bright most of the times, the mechas being very colourful.\nEach and every aspect of the Mechas had this cool looking \"glow\" effect to it, which looked amazing in dark scenes and in combat (as shown in the gif below).\n~~~img420(https://thumbs.gfycat.com/UnselfishPlumpClumber-size_restricted.gif)~~~\n<br>\n\n\n[**MUSIC:**]()\nDARLING in the FRANXX had a great soundtrack. The OP and the Torikago ED were especially great, making me fall in love with the show when I saw it.\nEach and every song seemed to fit in to the situation and battle quite nicely.\nSadly this alone was not able to bring the show back to its glory after episode 15.\n~~~img420(https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6f/ff/7d/6fff7daffdd8c0d576c964ff3b4dcd41.gif)~~~\n<br>\n\n\n[**OVERALL OPINION:**]()\nThis show had a **LOT** of potential, it managed to hook me in from the very start. The world, the characters, and even the plot looked very interesting. But as I mentioned numerous times it fell flat of, what I believe was, everyones expectations. The shift into space and the whole \"spirit\" thing was a big turn off for me personally but ever since episode 16 I felt like the show was kinda slowing down and turning sour.\n\nBasically what I want to say is... DARLING in the FRANXX was a 15 episode Anime.\n\n*(Note - woah that story summary turned out longer than I wanted, but hopefully you all enjoyed the review nonetheless!) *"}, {"id": 4088, "score": 64, "body": "__Welcome to THE SPACE SHOW__ est un anime d'aventure SF, de [Koji Masunari](https://anilist.co/staff/103187/Koji-Masunari) et [Hideyuki Kurata](https://anilist.co/staff/96967/Hideyuki-Kurata).\nHonn\u00c3\u00aatement, d\u00c3\u00a8s les vingts premi\u00c3\u00a8res minutes ont renifle une ambiance \u00c3\u00a0 la Ghibli.

While there are transformation sequences and a couple of friendship speeches, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a magical girl show, and it also doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t follow any of the general tropes of a shonen action show like _Dragon Ball_. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really structured like a JRPG- the main party of three young ladies are thrust into a fantastical world, given swords and magic, and told to save the land by the order of Princess Emeraude/Emerald. \n\nThe progression of the show is incredibly similar to that of a JRPG. They trot along, linearly, from locale to locale and villain to villain. From monstrous, animal-like beasts to mystic sorceresses, they fight every kind of enemy. (No slimes, unfortunately.) Instead of pure violence, they try to communicate clearly with everyone they fight, as feral as they are, and it makes for some great moments of dialogue and reason. A few of the villains even decide fighting isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worth it, and run off, perhaps saving the main characters later. No one really \u00e2\u0080\u009cdies\u00e2\u0080\u009d in _Rayearth_, for most of the runtime. The main characters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 armor and weapons literally become stronger with the experience points they gain. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to say this is all happy fun adventures, as there are a few dark developments that excellently set up the stakes of the world.\n\nI think the show shines specifically in its treatment of its characters. Hikaru, Fuu, and Umi are the only consistent cast (there are like 8 villains) and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a treat to watch. Their clearly element-oriented outfits and designs are pleasing to the eye, and they have outspoken personalities that clash and combine to make a lovely party. Hikaru is an especially entertaining and lovable girl, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s headstrong and tomboyish. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to not cheer for her efforts, and the audience is constantly rewarded with victories that are never one-sided, but earned. Hikaru is definitely the one thing I will remember from the show, if not anything else.\n\nThe action is also quite good. While it follows a basic shonen formula, where the heroes lose for  a couple of minutes before gathering their strength and taking it down, there are a few elements that keep it interesting to watch. The magic the main characters use is a bit repetitive but they still apply it in unique ways. There are, surprisingly, tactics involved in many of the combat scenarios.\n\nNow, for the weak parts. The story is a rough one. It starts as a generic \u00e2\u0080\u009csave the world\u00e2\u0080\u009d plot, and carries on with that for about 19 episodes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 out of 20. The last episode hits the audience with a bombshell of a plot twist that feels\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 off. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foreshadowed with tact, but only having one episode to digest and comprehend the implications of it is neither satisfying nor does it seem like a clever trick. It feels like an awful trick, actually. And the general pacing is good, but the pacing of the villains is pathetic. As I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen other people mention in reviews of this show, two villains are given a large majority of the episode count. Like, about 11 episodes are dedicated to two of them, out of a total of eight. Granted, one of them is a beast-master who summons powerful monsters to take on the protagonists, but still, seeing such familiar faces gets tiring. And the show does get terribly tiring in the middle point, when animation is constantly being reused and cheaped out on. The villains are the same, the conflicts are the same, and the magic is all the same. Episodes 7 through 14 is an absolute slog to get through. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty awful.\n\nThe ending makes up for a little in an absurd (SPOILERS but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in the OP so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really not that shocking) mech battle between two of the main villains and the protagonists. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great way to escalate what was a stagnating show, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really well-animated. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of weight to the weapons they use, and everything is designed with a slick style I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come to expect from CLAMP.\n\nThe animation is spotty. Some episodes look good, some just passable, some outright bad. The faces are the worst for this, but I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also just a quirk of CLAMP. The music is fine but it feels like about 5 tracks re-used. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great music, and they save the weightier pieces for very impactful moments, but the less important tracks are played over every little event.\n\nIn short, should you watch _Magic Knight Rayearth_? I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really know. Do you like low concept/impact high fantasy like _Dragon Quest_ or maybe even the Ys series? Do you like energetic high school girls getting armor and beating monsters up after they try to befriend them? Do you like magical girl shows but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re tired of the \u00e2\u0080\u009chiding identities\u00e2\u0080\u009d plotline? _Rayearth_ is for you. But if you just like regular high fantasy, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d go somewhere else. My first recommendation for a slightly older audience would be _DanMachi_, younger audience, I suppose _Deltora Quest_.\n\n6.5/10. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s by no means bad.\n"}, {"id": 4128, "score": 65, "body": "First thing's first, I've been a huge Dragon Ball fan ever since I was a toddler.

I must say that the backstory was actually one of the only times I've felt much emotion for the characters in Dragon Ball, other than History Of Trunks. \nThe rest of the movie was basically another Frieza formula where f(x) is Frieza and Broly was being pushed to be the x in Frieza's formula. Frieza merely has much of any relevance left within the Dragon Ball franchise, his recycling is getting so cliche that it's not even exciting or funny anymore. To add in Frieza to this movie was a weak plot device, and thus somehow makes Broly's relevance in the canon storyline somewhat corny. \n\nAnimation/Art: 8/10\n\nI must say that the animation in the movie looked fine, but as typical of Toei, there were those cringey, lazy animations as expected of them. However, that's not something I'd like to ramble on about. What I do think was amazing was the CGI they incorporated into movie using the same CGI as Dragon Ball FighterZ. The fights looked pretty astounding and that's where the movie did shine in glory with its animation. Overall, the animation wasn't bad at all, but props to that CGI. \n\nSoundtrack/Music: 5/10\n\nOther than the reminiscence of the traditional Dragon Ball themes, there didn't seem to be much of any connection with anything else. The soundtracks just seemed quite dull to me and barely intriguing. There was a drive to it, but not enough to keep it memorable. \n\nPersonal Enjoyment: 9/10 \n\nAs a typical Dragon Ball fan, I enjoyed the heck out of this movie, there shall be almost no complaints from my end except for what happened in the end. I was just straight up \"WTFing?\" out loud at the end. I didn't expect them to milk the character of Broly down to that level, but I guess I'll give them a chance since it's a whole different Broly compared to the one from the previous movies. \n\n\nVERDICT: 6/10\n\nIt was your typical Dragon Ball movie with all that corny Shonen stuff going and awesome fights, but if it's your first time watching, then I'm sure you might love it if you love Shonen fights. If you came expecting to see a good story, then I'd suggest you to not look further into this series. As stated before, I'm ready to watch another Dragon Ball movie or episode any day.\n\nKudos to the artists who put their efforts into movie !"}, {"id": 4152, "score": 62, "body": "<center>img(https://i.imgur.com/zMVkmUd.jpg)</center>\nGoblin Slayer was one of the most hyped up anime of the fall of 2018 mainly because we might finally get something dark and violent like Berserk that doesn't shy away from some brutal and messed up stuff. Regarding that, while it did show gore and the like, the more happy and wholesome kind of guys in the anime community was livid because it had rape scenes already in the first episode which they didn't like and started to bash the anime in multiple ways to satisfy their greed.\n\nWhile I am willing to admit Goblin Slayer was not what I wanted, it still ended up being a relative fun watch and an interesting take on the adventure aspect with some darker elements. You don't see much of this kind of anime, so it was refreshing in some ways. \n\n<h1><b>Story</b></h1>There is no goal like becoming stronger or any of the sort. Although, you have heroes in this anime which kills the more dangerous creatures like dragons, demons among everything else. Meanwhile, you have Goblin Slayer far secluded from everyone else who only kills goblins and nothing else if he can avoid it.\n\nWhile it might not be an issue at the time, as more goblins get produced it could become a huge problem, so in that way what Goblin Slayer is doing is an excellent work, one that is and shouldn't be ignored just because killing goblins is no fun or any other stupid reasons. It can come and bite you later, and when the problem is too big, it will be too late to cry about that.\n\nBeing only about killing the same old would just become boring in the long run, that's what you would call being repetitive. However, as he goes on his killing spree, you see him strategize, and there is even teamwork involved once he gets himself into a group of the rather fun and amusing bunch. With all likable and quirky personality, the anime became more fun once they entered the scene, according to myself at least.\n\n<h1><b>Art and Animation</b></h1>Art was not all to write home about, but it was acceptable and didn't come in my way as I was watching the anime. Although, I am willing to admit there are moments where the CGI is terrible that it did annoy me, but not enough to make that my whole reason to trash on the entire anime. \n\nThe anime does to a certain extent show gore and blood, and while I didn't think the censoring was an issue for me. Manga is far more brutal and detailed. One of the more messed up things you see in the anime is above and beyond in the manga; it's a very sickening sight. But being a fellow Berserk reader myself, I never had trouble with anime nor the manga concerning those aspects.\n\nAlso, if I had to compare it to Berserk, I would say they are nothing alike, and I don't see any point into making a false assumption about that. The only thing that I can without a shadow of doubt see that makes people think that way is the violent nature and the rape scenes. But, Berserk is another league when it comes to how grim and gritty and all of the above it is. If you haven't read it already and want something genuinely dark which gives it justice and more, then read Berserk and tell me how it's anything like the latter.\n\nAnimation beside CGI is okay, but during certain fight scenes, it became more fluid and looks better where you can see the studio put some effort int animating. It's not amazing but not so bad you can rave about that alone.\n\n<h1><b>Sound</b></h1>The sound was quite good in this case; there were some very memorable insert soundtracks and especially that beautiful opening song, which to this day I still go back and listen to. I want to see more of her Mili's work in the future; I enjoy listening to that opening song of Goblin Slayer, it's one of my favorite from 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, the voice acting was nice and did the job it was set out to do. I never once taught as I was watching if the character felt off or something similar. Adding on, the goblins were disgusting and dangerous, and their voices conveyed that well, it didn't feel false so to say. \n\n<h1><b>Characters</b></h1>Goblin Slayer as a character was not all that amazing, he was for the most part silent in the start and didn't talk too much. His conversation always had simple sentences or even when he answered questions, and he didn't go through the effort of lengthening them. However, as he got used to this new team, he started to show more character and life to him, making me in return enjoying his role more than before. That said, him being so not talkative was one of the aspects that produced some of the quite funny scenes in the anime, just because his character was like it was, it made for some hilarious moments which I can still go back and get a giggle or two out.\n\nThe rest of the cast is simple but effective; they did a wonderful job to give life to both the anime and our main character. Without them, the anime might not have hit so well of with me. Also, The dynamics between Elf Girl and the Dwarf was hilarious and never ceased to amuse me. The Lizard was also funny and made it all the more entertaining. The comedy was quite simple, but in some weird way, it was just sufficient to give me a good time. \n\n<h1><b>The Negative</b></h1>As a manga reader, I did notice some issue in the pacing and some things were cut out, or the order was changed. A particular scene especially might make no sense to anime onlies because there was no build up toward it.\n\nThe dialogue was also a bit lacking and felt more on-point in the manga. I am not a light novel reader, yet, but I am sure it's even better in the source material. Moreover, the last arc impact was not as strong as it was in the manga. Though, it was not bad either, just slightly lacking and could've been done better. It's only my gripe as a manga reader, so not something that should be true to everyone. \n\n<h1><b>Conclusion</b></h1>If you have some time to kill and want something dark but entertaining with a slightly unusual take on the adventure aspect. Then this anime might be you. However, if you are looking for something more like Berserk, then this will unfortunately not satisfy you. \n\nAt best, it will only give you the tip of the iceberg of what Berserk has to offer, maybe not even that. Are you able to look beyond that, you might find this anime enjoyable enough to entertain you for a few hours. It's not what I expected, but I still had a good time watching Goblin Slayer.\n<center>\n<h1><b>Overall Scores</b></h1>Story: 6/10\nCharacters: 6.5/10\nArt: 6/10\nEnjoyment: 6.5/10\nOverall: 6.2/10\n\n</center>"}, {"id": 4166, "score": 63, "body": "Radiant is basically just another shounen anime following the steps of Naruto and Black Clover, main character who is an outcast for some reason and has some sort of demonic ability that makes him special in a world where magic exists, powerful and different in some way.\n\nNow how does this anime differ from his predecessors, well shortly it doesn't, it is almost a Naruto copy/paste but at least the main character doesn't scream like hell all the time (Black Clover)... most of the time. \n\nThe story in this anime is pretty average the main character only has one goal and then what happens besides that it is filler. Although I enjoyed the Rumble Town arc which was pretty much the highlight of the show and gave me a few hopes for the second season.\n\nThe characters of this anime are pretty straightforward and there is not really a character that stands out , [Seth ](https://anilist.co/character/128547/Seth) is you typical screaming, fighting and good guy Jesus Christ type of character with some hidden demonic power that makes him an outcast and therefore wants to do something that will change people's view of him and his fellow sorcerers (reminds you of someone), while also protecting the people that discriminate him, the only two characters I personally enjoyed was [Melie](https://anilist.co/character/128549/Melie), being a sweet, naive and lovable girl that everyone loves while also having a double personality where she is badass and kind of tsunderish, and [Hameline](https://anilist.co/character/134335/Hameline) being a anti-hero type and one of the most beautiful characters I've seen in anime and having a really sad back story really helps her to stand out from the others, but still not enough for them to be remembered afterwards, now a character that wasn't really necessary was [Doc](https://anilist.co/character/128550/Doc) which was the worst part of the damn show and he is in most of the damn episodes with stupid slapstick comedy and unnecessary whining and screaming.\n\nIn terms of visuals and audio it is pretty standard, the op and ed are pretty good, in terms of visuals it doesn't really standout much but at least the fighting scenes are not just still images (Black Clover).\n\nHonestly I'm not surprised that this show will get a second season since is a shounen and even though it looks like it is not very popular and it isn't even from japanese source (French what?) it easily can get a second season for sure. I recommend this show if you are an hardcore Naruto or Black Clover fan but don't expect nothing special because it isn't, if you are not an hardcore fan of Naruto or Black Clover and don't wanna waste time then don't mess with it."}, {"id": 4169, "score": 68, "body": "Another Lady Innocent  (Front Innocent: Mou Hitotsu no Lady Innocent) is yet another anime involving Satoshi \"King of Breasts\" Urushihara, based on his artbook with the same name, meaning it's definitely something worth checking out for all you classy smut enthusiasts out there.\n\nThe plot is set during the Civil War, and a powerful landowner called Carson had a beautiful young daughter with an innocent heart, named Faye. As Faye enjoys an intense sexual relationship with her friend John and her servant girl Sophia, the end of her innocent days draws near. The mysterious Lord Mark has set his eyes on her and will stop at nothing to get her.\n\nUnfortunately, this story doesn't really go anywhere, as Lady Innocent/Front Innocent is only one episode long. It doesn't have a lot in terms of sex scenes, but the few that there are are pretty good for the most part. From what I've gathered, the production put all of it's money and effort into the first episode, leaving nothing for the 2 or 3 other episodes that were planned, and looking at the one episode that came out, I can believe that.\n\nAs a result, this is one of the best looking hentai that I've ever seen, and it surprisingly rivals a lot of non-hentai stuff in that department too. All of the characters are detailed and look good, and the animation is incredibly smooth. I never thought I would say this about a hentai, but this one might be worth checking out purely on art and animation alone. I know, I'm surprised too. My only complaint is that Lord Mark's face looks a little weird. It just looks off.\n\nSurprisingly, the DVD comes with an incredibly brief special feature focusing on the historical background of this hentai. Sure, it covers the most minimal of information possible, barely being 2 minutes in length, but apparently someone on the production team actually tried to read up on the time period. It's completely unnecessary to the hentai itself , but I guess it's a neat little addition, I guess.\n\nLady Innocent/Front Innocent is incredibly high in quality, even if there is no conclusion to it's story (if you're looking for that in your jerk off material). If you want to get your rocks off, this should be on the short list of hentai to check out."}, {"id": 4171, "score": 69, "body": "Every season has a shitty hentai short with a questionable premise. This season, we had *Papa Datte Shitai*, or, \"I'm a Dad, but I want to [fuck/be fucked]\" (The verbiage is not precise in Japanese like it is in English). Luckily, the premise for this one isn't an instant red flag-- a horny babysitter falling for a single dad is interesting enough to feel like a change of pace, while also being comfortably vanilla. As a gay romance between two men with a slight age gap, and with the wholesome presence of a cute little kid, *Papa Datte Shitai* distinguishes itself among the myriad of shitty hentai shorts that air every season.\n\n~~~img500(https://i.imgur.com/9xBA5Hc.jpg)~~~\n\nUnfortunately, the show starts the first few episodes with a very rapey tone. In fact, the first two episodes' sex scenes are pretty much sexual assault. It was uncomfortable to watch and bothered me a lot. Rape is something I definitely do not enjoy watching, and I find it especially problematic when sexual assault is presented as just something erotic for the viewer. That said, if you're able to make it through, the rest of the show is pretty consensual. Naruse (the titular Papa) will still sometimes say \"stop\" or \"no\" as the two fuck, but ultimately that is coming from a place of internalized homophobia instead of an actual desire not to fuck Asumi (the housekeeper and babysitter of his child). While that doesn't excuse the show from its still assault-y undertones, I'll take what I can get. \n\nOverall, I found the romance between the two to have decent progression throughout the show. It's a fairly predictable but still engaging plot- they fuck, they wonder if they actually like the other guy, they deal with some internalized homophobia, and gradually become closer with each other, rinse and repeat. Asumi is usually the aggressor, pushing Naruse's emotional boundaries, and then taking a step back when he's worried he's overstepped-- only to find that Asumi wants him to take another step closer. The addition of Ichika, Naruse's young child, adds a fun and cute element to the two's dynamic as well (and don't worry- the child is never made to be a part of the sex in any way). \n\n~~~img500(https://i.imgur.com/U2glozo.jpg)~~~\n\nThe sex scenes themselves were decent I guess. I don't really know to be honest, I'm a lesbian who likes reading BL for the romance. While the hentai was obviously a big part of the show, I went into it caring more about the romance part of it and got what I came for. If you're attracted to men, *Papa Datte Shitai* is probably some decent porn for you. While Asumi is nearly always the top/seme/aggressive/dominant one, he and Naruse engage in a variety of sex acts throughout the show, keeping things fresh in that area.\n\nSo, basically, I would recommend this show to anyone who's interested in seeing some guy on guy romance with porn. Or porn with romance. I don't know why else you would watch this. As a hentai romance, I'd probably give it a 7/10 or so. But since this is a BL hentai, I've got to make that a 69 for the memes. As an entry on my list among all the other shows I've seen, though, I'm giving it a 5.5/10. It's a half decent BL romance for an anime, but it's also still a seasonal hentai short with off kilter animation and an unfortunate rapey beginning. \n"}, {"id": 4172, "score": 51, "body": "There are many reasons why a piece of media is forgotten to the sands of time. Sometimes it's because something isn't very good, sometimes it's because it was released at a time that prevented it from getting a better foothold. In Colorful's case, it's because it just wasn't very memorable.\n\nSo what's the plot for this series? It doesn't have one! Based on a manga series, Colorful is a series that focuses on the misadventures of men staring, peeking, glancing, looking, and glaring at women and their efforts to get that extra eyeful of harmlessly exposed panties, bras, and occasional cleavage and the outrageous consequences of their actions.\n\nIt's more like a sketch show with a few reocurring characters and exactly one sketch rather than an ongoing series, which should be pretty obvious with it's tagline \"Roses are red. Violets are blue. This show's about panties.\"\n\nSome series have a character that's a pervert for comedic relief, or even have it as the main focus, but Colorful distills the perverted comical relief down into 96 minutes, consisting of 16 short 6 minute episodes. The whole thing pretty much feels like a montage of the slapstick pervert characters from a bunch of other longer running series. By the end of the series it definitely feels a little long in the tooth, and it doesn't have the benefit of being broken up by an actual story or other events going on. It's ecchi comedy distilled into the length of a feature film.\n\nI'd complain that a series with this little substance got made, but there have been series out there with somehow even less substance. And at least Colorful doesn't pretend that it's something that it's not. If anything, I can give this seres credit for at least being interesting with it's animation and art style, often being mildly creative with the way it looks.\n\nColoful has been described as a very love it or hate it show, seemingly being described as \"wildly funny\" or \"tasteless and depraved\", and it's easy to see why. It's very unashamed of what it is, a series of vulgar panty jokes one after another with very little breathing room. I'm pretty sure there is an audience out there for something like this, but it would be an incredibly niche one at that."}, {"id": 4210, "score": 60, "body": "img520(https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/55513l.jpg)\nHello and welcome to my first hentai review.\n\nAs hokey as it sounds, I originally didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know this was a hentai manga. While reading Outlanders, I decided to look up other works by Jouji Manabe. One such work was Ring x Mama, and Myanimelist said it was ecchi, so I _did_ do my homework...\n\n...that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily mean I did my homework _well_. Anilist correctly lists the manga as a hentai. Furthermore, it was published under Namaiki! which exclusively serializes hentai. \n\nIn my defense, one review of Ring x Mama praised its story, saying it did a good job of job of blending fanservice with a compelling sports theme. So, what is the story, anyway?\n\nRing x Mama tells the story of Ryoma, a young-man who idolized the wrestlers of the disbanded joshi puroresu (Japanese women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s professional wrestling) team, Gigamax. Most of all, he loves their leader: Justice Asuka. In his apartment he watches and masturbates to Justice\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrestling matches. One day, while watching a match, his landlord checks up on him. After having sex, he soon discovers that his landlord, Sanae Takamori in fact Justice Asuka. Thereafter, he becomes both Justice\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boyfriend and the manager of Gigamax.\n\nFrom this, I thought the manga could end up being actually pretty good. The sports element was established early on. Getting Gigamax back off the ground and watching Justice\u00e2\u0080\u0099s struggles in the ring, both from a professional and personal standpoint could make for a compelling story. But, depending on what you focus on, it sounds like it could be the plot (well, \u00e2\u0080\u009cplot\u00e2\u0080\u009d) to a cheap pornographic film. So which does Ring x Mama end up being? is it? A compelling story tthat happens to have sex? Or a porn with a plot? \n\nIt's very, very much the latter.\n\nTo begin with praise, I must give credit where credit's due: Ring x Mama works well as an erotic manga. Manabe is a very, very good artist, drawing people that are realistic and pleasing. He's good at making proportions large while not dipping into absurd territory. It's surprising considering how cartoon-y the characters in Outlanders work. The sex scenes are long and quite detailed. Manabe knows his intended audience quite well. Ring x Mama is harem manga, so Ryoma ends up having intercourse with many women; all of various appearances and personalities, so readers will likely find a character they're drawn to. In a harem manga, it's important to ensure that everyone is distinct, and Manabe does this well. A lot of different sexual techniques and situations are explored, making it even more likely that someone's interests will be appealed to. Footplay, cunnilingus, anal, snowballing, sex outdoors, to name a few.\n\nI didn't find the story laugh-out-loud funny, but it has its moments when I chuckled. I wouldn't recommend checking it out for the comedy, however.\n\nimg520(https://i.imgur.com/ssFLL0S.jpg)\n\nNow, it's time to talk about where Ring x Mama flounders like a dying fish: the story.\n\nYou can probably tell the story won't be of that high-caliber from the very first chapter. Ryoma has an extensive collection of his idol. Fine. Then Sanae comes in and everything falls apart. One: if he really is obsessed with Justice as much as the manga would lead us to believe, how in the hell can he not recognize her face nor her voice? Two: why is Sanae not at all put off by the fact that her tenant has been systematically masturbating to her? Three: Ryoma's hero worship of her persisting through her retirement causes her to realize that her fans still care about her. Okay, that makes sense. Why have sex with Ryoma though? What makes him any different than the countless other creepy fans she doubtless has? Because he was the first one she met? Why start a steady relationship with him? Why give him a managerial position despite his lack of credentials besides having knowledge that any devout fan of joshi pororesu would have? Because he's good in bed?\n\nYou might think that I'm getting a bit nitpicky, but it's to prove a point: Ring x Mama isn't really focused on the story and it shows in the first few chapters. Things don't really get better. The harem is downright nonsensical. Women, no matter who they are, no matter if they have a partner or not, will drop everything to have sex with Ryoma. If the character is a woman and appears in Ring x Mama, they _will_ meet the wrath of Ryoma's spear (that was bad, I'm sorry). Why does every woman find him irresistible though (ignoring the fact that he's the nigh-only male character in this world, of course)? Because he's described as being skilled in bed and being very well-endowed? Okay, well what about before they get to that part? Eventually, this question is somewhat answered when Ryoma's exploits are told via word-of-mouth, but still, why Ryoma?\n\nimg520(https://i.imgur.com/46GgfHM.jpg)\n\nNot to mention, I'm unsure of the dynamics of Ryoma and Justice's relationship in terms of exclusivity. With how much Ryoma gets around, this question would naturally come up. Thankfully it's answered in the story...but not really. Justice will often show annoyance at Ryoma's promiscuity, but its seemingly forgotten in a few pages. The only time Justice is shown getting angry at Ryoma's sexual exploits is when he has sex with Justice's sworn enemy. Given Justice's attitude, I'd like to think they're in a poly relationship of sometime, but this is never confirmed. Clarification would have been nice.\n\nThe characters don't  know what seem to be obvious dynamics, either. A few chapters before the end, a character laments that Ryoma must only see the women as \"fuck buddies.\" The poor woman wasn't genre savvy enough to figure out that she was some 40-odd chapters into a harem hentai manga.\n\nI was annoyed at a small detail: Ryoma never, ever uses condoms. Maybe I seem like a prude, but if you're a sexual work with a plot, I'd think this aspect needs to be acknowledged. How has no one gotten pregnant? Are they taking birth control pills? Does literally everyone connected to Gigamax and its parent company, Jiang Piang have their Fallopian tubes tied? Somewhat uncomfortable questions for some, I'm aware, but you can't have your cake and eat it too. Either you have a long, drawn-out plot that takes its world seriously, or you have a nonsensical and inconsequential serial hentai.\n\nAnd I get it. I get the harem, I get being irresistible, I get the unprotected sex. It's a wish-fulfillment fantasy, with readers placed inside the shoes of every man, Ryoma. There's nothing wrong with wish-fulfillment, it's the backbone of many types of works, including a large portion of pornography. But the problem comes in trying to have a good story with it. The things that occur in our lives happen with a reason. If a work changes details about life, there needs to be a reason why things are different, lest the story ends up being shallow and, to be blunt, often nonsensical.\n\nimg520(https://i.imgur.com/XLKVO5n.jpg)\n\nBut fine, it's not a Shakespearean play, so what? A lot (if not all) of the anime I love aren't. Ring x Mama's story could still be interesting, right? Well, the fact that the manga focused on sex above all else makes the story objectively sub-par as _well_ as bland. For this, let's look at the first chapter again.\n\nIt culminates in a sex scene. Okay, nothing terrible, but it's a bit strange. A work with sex not as the focus generally doesn't have it so early on. But maybe the author just wanted to show readers what they were getting into. The second chapter culminates in sex, then the third. The story doesn't have to try because it comes second to the sex.\n\nAnd things just get stale soon. Manabe's art doesn't get worse, but if you're reading it as a story, having each chapter be nothing substantial followed by sex gets old. Reading it as erotica might work, but the manga's a bit long for that, and it _does_ try to have a story.\n\nSports hardly is incorporated into the story. Characters seldom learn new techniques, fights are hardly shown, and Manabe's role as a manager is hardly shown. The best parts of the work are when the logistics of wrestling are shown, but those are very few and far between. If Manabe wanted to tie sex and wrestling together (besides the very surface-level observation that female wrestlers might wear less clothes than the average women), he could have made it like [Keijo!!!!!!!!](https://anilist.co/anime/21639/Keijo/) where the sexual aspects are incorporated into the sport (such as an attack utilizing a wrestler's breasts). But this didn't happen. I never got what I came to the manga for and I was left pretty annoyed.\n\nimg520(https://i.imgur.com/hT2ALjs.jpg)\n\nThere are some arcs. The story seems to pick up after Darkness Aoi, Justice's sworn enemy, starts becoming an active player in the plot. However, the story begins to stagnate again and not enough happens to make Ring x Mama a good story. It ends on a cliffhanger, but I didn't really care enough about the story to wonder what happened afterward.\n\nFor this review, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best to try to be as objective as possible (thus giving a final verdict based on Ring x Mama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own merits) or simply judging based on my own experience with the manga (thus having the fact that I read a hentai expecting an ecchi color my view of Ring x Mama). Mixing the two is best, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a problem.\n\nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t review porn.\n\nimg320(https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/55507.jpg)\n\nNot because I hate pornography, but because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inherently hard to review. What would I even base my score on? How it made me feel? How good the characters were drawn? In that case, Ring x Mama would get an 8.0 at worst. Everything I criticized the manga for wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter. After all, it would be porn. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not held to the same standards as story or character-driven works. Even if things could be better, all porn has to do is its job, nothing more. If nothing else, Ring x Mama is tantalizing. \n\nBut I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that would be quite fair to me. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t read Ring x Mama as a hentai, and my personal experience makes me rate Ring x Mama much lower than I would, objectively. Sure this is mostly a fault of my own, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think Ring x Mama can escape _all_ blame. Given the manga\u00e2\u0080\u0099s length and given that the story goes through arcs and changes (albeit infrequently), it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe to say that Jouji Manabe _did_ wish to tell a stronger story than what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s typically seen in hentai. Unfortunately, Ring x Mama doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do enough to be taken seriously as a story.\n\nUltimately, Ring x Mama is too focused on being a good hentai to be a good story. I suppose I can recommend it as a hentai, if you're fine with the length. If an engaging story with sexual elements is what you're looking for, then I really cannot recommend Ring x Mama on any grounds. It could've been better, but that would mean decreasing the sexual content, and that wouldn't work for the type of anthology it was released in. \n\nimg520(https://i.imgur.com/MirvE3n.jpg)\n\nAnd hopefully this is the last hentai I end up reviewing, because they really aren't meant to be reviewed.\n\n6.0/10\n\nD-\n"}, {"id": 4213, "score": 65, "body": "I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really have anything towards badminton regardless I really liked this sport for a long, long time. But, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know why I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not into it now. Yet, I watch everything as long as it can so, why not? \u00e2\u0080\u009cHanebado!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, at first, really caught me in the first episode. But, there is something at the bottom in my heart that I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t express it. The first episode introduces all of your favorite characters including Nagisa, Ayano, Riko, Erena, and upcoming side characters. The prologue starts with something similar to your sports anime tropes especially \u00e2\u0080\u009cHaikyu!!\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Nagisa and Ayano, at their backstory, competed in a badminton championship. However, Nagisa lost heavily and Ayano didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel victorious so her opponent as well.\n\nAs the story progresses, they finally meet again in one school and one club. Regardless of the story is about Ayano, sometimes, there is a transition from the point of view of two main characters including Nagisa. Ayano, when it comes to badminton, is a sociopathic with a beast-like mode. Nagisa, on the first hand, is more into winning and trying hard. She is more human if you compare it with Ayano. When it comes to badminton, she is the most competitive player you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever met. Ayano, on the other hand, played by her psychology in which her mother motivated her, a former badminton player. But, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just the worst mom ever.\n\nBesides Ayano and Nagisa, there is some of the underlook supporting characters which everybody doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give a freak about them. The show, in the end, was never serious nor focused on other characters. Like for example, Connie, Ayano\u00e2\u0080\u0099s childhood \u00e2\u0080\u009cfriend\u00e2\u0080\u009d. She is more like a douchebag at the time of her first introduction. But the more story progress, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know why she suddenly became an out-of-character just because she wanted to be recognized as a sibling relationship for Ayano.\n\nThere is Riko as a side character and supporting character especially to Nagisa. Her character development isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t too highlighted besides she is a best friend of Nagisa. She only gets a small role so that her impression seems forgettable. There are some of the male characters including Kentarou, Yukiteru, and Gaku. But as I said from the beginning, people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really give care on them or maybe except Kentarou as an important supporting character.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHanebado!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, from the start, was a show about Nagisa and Ayano. The chemistry between the two characters really overlooked in such a way. In some arc, the story focuses on Nagisa. But the more it goes, the story focuses on Ayano. In the end, everything collided into one. In my opinion, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve predicted that it would end like that from prologue to epilogue. Nagisa encouraged Ayano to play back to badminton. Because Ayano has more than enough potential but she should waste that. Both of them are completely, sometimes, act different personalities. Where can I say this show as psychological? Or some way? I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a decent sports anime.\n \nFor a sports show compared to some other anime, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHanebado!\u00e2\u0080\u009d is rather quite real to be said as a sport. For example, the development of characters and their skill. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s noticeable, of course, even for Ayano as overpowered here, the show always shows her weaknesses. There is also Nagisa who has to deal with herself and Ayano as well. This show as well shows quite strong drama elements. In addition to mixing with psychology, this anime carries a strong emotional feeling enough to its characters. But, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not too highlighted thanks to the lack of supporting characters as their trigger of the main characters. Although it seems to be in several episodes, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change anything.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHanebado!\u00e2\u0080\u009d has one of the best production quality visuals at the season. There are so many motion captures included when it comes to characters movement. Every movement in this anime feels real with good support by the cinematography. The gesture, the 3D motion, and the character designs gave a clean-look from each character. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very much impressive but something is up here. I think, this show has a demographic for men. Although there was no filler and it was already visible at first, it was most of the characters, the key was that some of the design characters were given huge breasts. I mean, there is no sport bra in this anime, I guess. But overall, the art is very impressive and has a lot of energy. The opening and ending theme songs contain a work of art. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely worth watching when it comes to this.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHanebado!\u00e2\u0080\u009d grabs my first attention but there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much potential when it comes to story and characters. Plus, the show mixes a lot of psychological and drama things. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind that but the show isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t too logical when it comes to that. I understand how everyone feels if they lose badly or whatever but this show put emotional stress to play with you. On the other hand, this show is recommended to you who love badminton or maybe not. It has the potential of a decent narrative yet great visual animation. I hope, this show still continues with even bigger stakes on it."}, {"id": 4214, "score": 64, "body": "# [~~~**This review will contain Spoilers for the show!**~~~]()\n<br>\nI loved Steins;Gate, it was a show which although had a slow start managed to go above and beyond with its story and characters. I had high hopes for this one too, but sadly it just didn't feel right.\n\n[**_(SPOILER AHEAD)_ STORY:**]()\nSteins;Gate 0 takes place in the Beta World Line. To understand why you would be required to watch Episode 23B. But here let me summarise it for you. In episode 23B Okarin's attempt failed at helping Kurisu, at this point he would've gotten a message from his future self but doesn't. He is the future self. To put it simply we follow the story of the \"Future\" Okarin who sends the D-Mail back to help and \"trick time\".\n\nThis whole concept sounds fantastic, we get to see the depressed Okarin think of a way to save the world and Kurisu what more can we ask for?\nYeah well there was an issue, the show felt really off. It was slow, **VERY** slow. For me it also felt like they were dragging it on for quite some time, everytime an advancement is made by anyone it is held back by Okarin. It is understandable that Okarin would not want to go back and try again to relive those nightmares of attempts but when it happens everytime up until the last few episodes it does ruin the fun a bit.\n\n~~~img420(https://66.media.tumblr.com/30e839ac84ede1c54b643ef6286eab54/tumblr_p7eicqd81G1u1uafro5_r1_500.gif)~~~\n<br>\n\n\n[**CHARACTERS:**]()\nIn this show we get to see not only our beloved old characters that we grew to love in the previous show, we are also introduced to many new ones.\n*(I won't be talking much about the old characters unless they changed or something happened, Okarin for example)*\n\nThe most important characters that were introduced into this series were:\n>Maho Hiyajou, Alexis Leskinen, and Kagari Shiina.\n\nThese newcomers served as the sole reason that the events of this show could progress. Maho especially was a critical part of the show throughout it whole.\nKagari and Leskinen were important in the last few episodes but still had important roles to fill.\n\nMaho, an old friend of Kurisu. She is the one who introduced Okarin to the Amadeus System and also was a major part of Daru's workforce that wanted Okarin to try and save the past again. Maho's personality is similar to Kurisu's, though she is a bit more \"shy\". Overall she is nice and tries her best to help Daru fix the machine.\n\nLeskinen, smart boi who loves shaman girls. He is the main villain, though we learn that near the end of the show. He wants the time machine.\nAt first he seems calm and collected with no intents of mass murder, but we later find out he is hiding a more mean side to his personality as mentioned before.\n\nKagari, future adopted daughter of Mayushii. She travelled back with Suzuha to 1998 but managed to get lost. She now has amnesia and was part of Leskinen's plan. Her personality resembles a child, especially when she is near Mayushii. She is always happy and wants to help people.\n\nOkarin and \"Kurisu\" also got quite the changed. Okarin went from his usual Chuuni self to a more \"Normie\" and depressed individual.\nHe has given up on any kind of Time Travel due to the agony he had to endure back then.\n\"Kurisu\"....well she is dead, as mentioned this is the Beta Line. She makes an appearance in the form of an A.I. She is still behaving like the usual self though does not remember Okarin.\n\nAll in all the characters are great, we got introduced to many great new ones and got to see our old heroes.\nThough my biggest dislike towards this show was that we got introduced to new characters that seemed like a bigger deal then they were.\nIn the previous show pretty much **every** character had a purpose and was explained. In this was not so much.\n~~~img420(https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/934945136888025563/27637B85D640F52E474D0F4EB448B8B5C09E084E/)~~~\n<br>\n\n\n[**ART/ANIMATION:**]()\nSteins;Gate 0 had a very similar art style and animation like the \"original\" Steins;Gate.\nThe colours were more on the dark side to fit the depressing atmosphere, the animation was quite good though nothing groundbreaking.\n\nThough that being said there were some scenes which filled me with so much hype that it managed to distract me from everything else in the show.\nOne is visible below this section.\n~~~img420(https://66.media.tumblr.com/9914fe2328bd61dcfdec7e244b7c6189/tumblr_pfooz8RObm1sxkjwwo1_500.gif)~~~\n<br>\n\n\n[**MUSIC:**]()\nSteins;Gate 0 (just like the previous installment) has a wonderfull soundtrack. The music fits so well with the given situation, the inclusion of some old time classics is also a good thing!\nThe OPs and EDs of the show were fantastic from the get-go. The animation/visuals and music were mixed together so well. The original OP still holds a special place in my heart but these ones do stand on their own!\n~~~img420(https://thumbs.gfycat.com/FrailLameCurassow-size_restricted.gif)~~~\n<br>\n\n\n[**OVERALL OPINION:**]()\nSteins;Gate 0 is a show with an amazing concept of looking deeper into Okarin and just how much he got affected by the events that happened in the previous world-line, the idea of exploring the way that Okarin managed to send that D-Mail back was also something I wanted to see. Sadly though the way this was executed just did not make me as thrilled as I was in the previous show. I have heared from multiple people that the Visual Novel was **MUCH** better, I have yet to play it myself but will \"soon\" get to it."}, {"id": 4218, "score": 67, "body": "Satou Matsuzaka is a girl who doesn't know what love really means. She doesn't have a meaningful life. In fact, she tried to find love even sacrifice herself for a man who tried to express love to her. However, an empty jar never filled the candy inside. The jar only filled with dust, spiders and cracked. If only her heart wanted to try to explain it, then the candy would be full in the jar she had. Therefore, came a child, Shio Koube. She is an innocent child who has lots of sweets. Shio then fully realized how powerless Satou was. So from that, she had various sweets until the jar was full. Her life is meaningful again. Now, she lives with happiness filled with sugar in it.\n\n\"Happy Sugar Life\" seems to sell candy to children. It's a show that combines various elements such as dark, horror, suspense, and thriller. I also like stories about anti-heroes who try to do anything to fulfill their desires. However, this anime seems nothing more than a gimmick who wants to be edgy. At first glance, I understand this is more than \"don't judge the book by its cover\" or something like that. Matsuzaka Satou shows her character with two \"personalities\" or rather, two lives. The motive she has is nothing more than a girl who wants to ask for candy. For Satou, Shio is the candy and if anyone dares to disturb them, you don't want to start it first.\n\nThe plot actually doesn't seem cliche nor complex. \"Happy Sugar Life\" has many mental illnesses you can get. There are pedophilia, masochism, sociopathic, psychopathic, PTSD, heavy obsession, anti-social, and others. Satou more precisely presented some of the things mentioned. She more precisely isolated herself in a normal apartment, outside of her. But, darkness began to envelop inside. The first episode is quite promising where the episode shows two characters committed suicide on top of a burning apartment. It's kind of neat, I guess, and I want to know why that happened.\n\nMeanwhile, the chemistry between Satou and Shio, in my opinion, was not normal. More precisely, they are so weird. They performed a ritual ceremony of marriage-like, kiss each other, and sharing one jar with each other. On the other hand, Satou is a normal female teenager. She is not the type of \"yandere\" or something like that. She is more of a complex character with a various twist. Depending on how the context can be taken, she will do anything, I mean, anything to be able to protect the candy. And of course, she doesn't like something bitter. Everyone, too - I mean - something \"bitter\", I think.\n\nThis show is kind of similar to \"School Days\" where the show presents someone who has a high lust. That high lust turns them into people who are not the same anymore. I don't know if you still remember this legend anime includes that phenomenal sailing boat ending. Anyway, \"Happy Sugar Life\" seems to use the same concept but in a bad and excessive way. Like for example Taiyou who presented pedophilia and severe trauma to adult women. There is Satou\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aunt presents her psychology full of lust. There is so much character in that. Some, in my opinion, there are normal characters besides Shio. There is Shouko Hida as Satou\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best friend.\n\nFor a psychopath show, there aren't too many murder scenes in this anime. Some characters, sometimes, often reject their intentions in order to kill these people for any reason. Sometimes too, it seems, once again, like they sell its own gimmick. This is like some kind of \"Breaking Bad\" type of characters where everybody in this show always breaks badly. They break badly in a logical way because there is so much backstory on them. So, some of the characters have their intention to be able to reach their ego. The more the story progress, it's kind of similar to that show. When one person fails, everything will end or vice versa. But, a continuous reflection who should we sympathize.\n\nThe ending is natural. No more than happy and even bad ending. It seems like it's hard to explain how the ending is. Meanwhile, Ez\u00cf\u008cla studio is a new studio and \"Happy Sugar Life\" is their first anime project. The visual combines some impressions of happiness like \"this is got to be a high-school girl slice of life show\". But, it's always taking you into a dark place like when you were in Satou's apartment. It contains a lot of violence besides there isn't much content murder in it. In addition, there are many very disturbing moments not for everyone will be able to endure. The sensitive and serious themes make this anime not recommended for people who are too sensitive. I also like the glitch-style concept they carry.\n\nI love the opening song. It's taking me back with Ho-kago Tea Time's \"NO, Thank You!\" but edgier yet still catchy. Kana Hanazawa as Satou was so great in this anime. A great talent when casting one character with many personalities. She is known for her out-of-characters type characters. She always carries a \"yandere\" type of character but doesn't often cast as cute characters. The ending song is just as memorable as the opening song. But, I like it because it's more into feeling, kindness, and smoothly. Misaki Kuno as Shio also managed to bring her character to full performance.\n\n\"Happy Sugar Life\" is a love story full of all kinds of abnormalities. It combines with many elements such as psychological, horror, thriller, drama, dark, and etc. This is also far from the word \"bad\" because it's just another average anime that sells a few gimmicks in it. I love the art for a new studio. Characters that are a bit complex when the story progresses forward. The soundtrack with the glitchy effects just making it hard for you to survive. At least, this is not recommended for those of you who don't like many disturbing or slightly explicit scenes."}, {"id": 4224, "score": 60, "body": "A mecha show with a unique concept done almost entirely in CG. What could go wrong?\n\nRevisions begins in Shibuya, focusing in on second-year Daisuke Toujima. In the past, he was abducted then saved by a mysterious woman. He was told that it was his destiny that he would protect everyone from some unknown event in the future. Now, in the year 2017, the entire city of Shibuya gets transported 300 years into the future. Giant robots that come from the wasteland beyond the borders of the city start obliterating the shocked populous. The unknown woman then confronts Kaisuke again all these years later with a mech called a \u00e2\u0080\u009cString Puppet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d to go against the \u00e2\u0080\u009cRevisions\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Now, Daisuke and his companions have to find a solution to fight off the revisions while trying to bring the city back to their original time.\n\nFirst and foremost, the most prominent feature of this entire ONA is the CG aspect of the show. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not incredible, but also it's done very competently. The CG never went into the uncanny valley at any point. It just seemed like a normal anime. Not as beautiful or elegant as Houseki No Kuni, but it had its own moments shown in its fight scenes. It may sound like it's being downplayed, but it should be stated that this could be a big step in the future of CG anime. It looks good and is well made, if this is ever normalized, then it would truly bring out the best in what the medium of CG has to offer.\n\nThe main gripe of this show lies within its characters. Every character is awful in most regards. Although most of the complaints come from its main character. Daisuke himself. So his whole deal was that he was told at a young age that he was destined to protect everyone. And Daisuke took it far beyond the logical extreme. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taken to the point where one can compare him to a doomsday prepper. He has a copious amount of preserved food in his home. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hyper-defensive of his friends and protecting everyone to the point of random bouts of violence. In a good amount of his scenes, he mentions that it's his destiny to protect everyone, and uses that as justification to go do stupid things. During the events of the show, he runs headfirst into dangerous situations often and normally ruins things for everyone. He literally kills people by accident during one of his lack of planning and headstrong idiot nature. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also very self-entitled, believing that he is the leader for almost no reason other than that he feels he deserves it.\n\nThe side characters and villains are more tolerable though. Not because they're better, but because they're just cardboard cutouts. All four of Daisuke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friends don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really like him at all, and frequently complain about his actions and headspace. It doesn't even seem like their friends, but the show hits us over the head with the themes of teamwork and friendship. The villains are better written than the main group though. They seem to have more interesting individual motivations behind everything, along with some interesting character design. Almost nothing is accomplished between them, but they had a decent amount of potential.\n\nWhile watching this show, at least during the first couple of episodes, the concept drives everything. It was super interesting to how everyone reacts to an entire city being transported to the future. One would think that there would be chaos in the streets. Like in so many other apocalypse stories before. But instead, the city organizes a provisional government. They keep track of everything, try to help find a way back to their time, and keep the peace. And the most interesting part is that people still listen to them, because otherwise it means certain death by giant robot. Some very smart things are done in regards to this provisional government and feels like the best idea the show had. \n\nIn conclusion, Revisions relies on mostly its concept and CG animation, which by itself is noteworthy. Although, the characters in the show bring the show to a lower level to the point of annoyance. It has ideas, but mostly wasted or not lived to its full potential here. Not enough to keep me interested. Watch it if you wanna see good CG shows. This is a Netflix show and was released all at once, so look there if you're interested. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a 6 out of 10. This has been your spoiler free but not really review on Revisions."}, {"id": 4233, "score": 50, "body": "Tell me if you've heard this one before.

And that's not really a negative, since it has all of the charm of a so-bad-it's-good type of thing. But most of that comes from the English dub of this hentai.\n\nWith the English dub, the people writing the English script seem to be completely aware that they're writing for a trashy porn, and go for a comedic script ala \"Ghost Stories\" instead of just doing a 1:1 of the original Japanese script. This means that Midnight Strike Force has a lot of dumb puns, inappropriate jokes, and an overall fun tone. With the Japanese version, it just comes across as a half-assed attempt just to have sex scenes.\n\nSpeaking of sex scenes, there aren't a whole lot of them. They're there, but they feel like they're there just because this happened to be a hentai, and it needed sex scenes. They're not bad, just there.\n\nAs for plot itself, it's pretty much your standard cheesy B-Movie type of plot to get the anime from setpiece to setpiece. I can't really complain since it's an excuse plot and wasn't really meant to be paid attention to. It does it's job for the most part.\n\nThe animation is actually OK. Nothing amazing, but decent. You might be asking \"If I'm here just for the wank material, who cares about the animation?\" I've seen so much poorly animated hentai that merely just having decent animation is worth noting. I know it's hentai, but I can't really use it for it's intended use if it looks like something a child could draw or some amateur teenager circa 2003 Newgrounds could animate. The voice acting is tolerable, but like the English script, the people behind the scenes were just doing this for the paycheck, and decided to have some fun while doing it.\n\nIf you're looking for something so-bad-it's-good, this is right up there with the infamously bad English Bible Black and Sextra Credit's (Mejoku's) hilariously great dub."}, {"id": 4234, "score": 54, "body": "\u00e2\u0080\u009cEdgy\u00e2\u0080\u009d, according to the dictionary, is an adjective of tense, nervous, or irritable.

There you have it, your underpraised show. But, what I love about her character is that the show doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give her serious hope. Maybe, that applies in the last episode. But, Aya Asagiri is the worst thing in this world. I mean, there is no overestimation here. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just saying that she is the one who describes it in real and clear terms. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not an emo guy or whatever.\n\nTo say \u00e2\u0080\u009cMagical Girl Site\u00e2\u0080\u009d as an average show, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll say yes because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually pretty decent. There is no good, no bad as well. This is really a simple story and a representation of Aya Asagiri as a scapegoat. But, after she was finding out a website called, you guessed it, Magical Girl Site, all girls got magical items. They have their own uniqueness like Aya who can teleport her opponent to where she wants. Bottom line, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like a simple story with not many things in it. There is an action in it and the plot is quite messy. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of those anime where I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really give anything with. I watch it with no high expectations, personally, because I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have anything to do.\n\nSimple, Aya Asagiri does not have any personality. She is always encouraged by other characters such as her first meeting with Tsuyuno. I hope, this will be something of a battle between magical gears with one another. But, the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s frick around. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really like the ending where it turns out to be a yuri romance, more precisely, between Aya and Tsuyuno. Other characters as well don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give a frick with that. Suddenly, this anime turned into a friendship where I expected something more \u00e2\u0080\u009cedgy\u00e2\u0080\u009d again. But, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just another slap to me.\n\nOne uniqueness that made me most focus on his character, Nobuhiko Okamoto as Kaname Asagiri. He is, for real, the scumbag guy with a quite unique backlash and role. Nobuhiko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance at this point is so great. His character as a scumbag really pissed me off in a few. His personality is real. There was a bastard smile appeared to the author when trying to write this character. And the defenders succeeded. Yuko Ono as Aya Asagiri did a solid job. Yuu Serizawa as Nijimin is quite good regardless of the same type as other characters from other anime. Himika Akaneya is pretty good as well.\n\nThe opening theme song is just standard rock music with a little edgy element. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self-explanatory and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look excessive. Same with the ending. The ending is just weird for me when you see two girls doing a live-action dance on a school rooftop. I just\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know.

As much as we can say that books aren't judged by their covers, we know better. Everyone judges a book by its cover, because with so artistic visions out there, if we can't take a cover at face value, we'll never be able to follow any journey. The key behind the clich\u00c3\u00a9 is that if we do judge a book based on its cover, we have to hope that it delivers on what is being sold, trusting that the text is wearing its heart literally on its sleeve. \n\nAnd that's unfortunately what After the Rain was not able to do. Because while it is a fantastically beautiful character drama of two very confused, complicated souls, it does not truly follow-through on its broader ambition. \n\nimg(https://gifimage.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/after-the-rain-gif-5.gif)\n\nAfter the Rain's general premise is the sort of thing to raise eyebrows: a romance between a seventeen year old track star and a forty-five year old manager grinding his middle-adulthood working at a simple, no fluff restaurant. Two unique individuals who, under the circumstance of working at the same place, have sparks fly, have love bloom, and have a deepening bond together. The age factor is obviously the more controversial portion of this, and will certainly turn many off out-of-hand by the implications. \n\nBut if one is willing to suspend their disbelief for a moment around the concept, it is the lack of commitment toward that vision that would both keep those more prudish among us around to continue watching, and is likely also ultimately the downfall of After the Rain. \n\nimg(https://pa1.narvii.com/6744/1b27c774704b2ab383ca9a80890386a200540fd7_hq.gif)\n\nThe big issue with After the Rain is that is fails to truly execute on its romantic narrative that is built up from the very beginning. The female lead Tachibana is stern, a little hard-headed, a little naive, and a lot of socially awkward. She very quickly realizes she has brooding feelings of romance for her manager, and seems so head-over-heels by the proposition that admitting her feelings to him seems like the most logical option. Kondou is more level-headed, having already had his time in the spotlight for teen romance, almost viewing his time as over, having passed long ago with his youth, yet with a vague, underlying notion that he deserves happiness even when he doubts he should attain it. \n\nAnd this sounds like a fantastic premise for a romance, yes? Two people who want something, are horrible at acting on it, who will inevitably end up together. The issue here is that their romance is plodding, to say the least. The show emphasizes their growth as individuals, allowing their coy but ultimately platonic interactions to balance out their own personal woes. They each learn lessons, learn more about themselves in the process, and grow both closer to each other as well as closer to their own understanding of their ideals. But the speed at which this is executed is drastically slow. While the interactions feel legitimate and natural, you're essentially left on the edge of your seat the entire viewing internally screaming JUST KISS ALREADY. Will they or won't they? Will they get out of their ruts or won't they? It's an eternal question riding a wave through the entire series. \n\nimg(https://i.redd.it/03efjpqdnig21.gif)\n\nWhich comes to where the show does excel, which is on its aspect of character drama. As the show continually institutes new characters, adding complexity to the narrative, different threads that will eventually be handled or otherwise strummed for emotional payoff, After the Rain spends its time analyzing the characters, their thoughts, their ambitions, and how they all interrelate. And it's quite skilled at this! After the Rain frequently takes a quieter approach to things, allowing scenes to play slowly and breathe, while also not going out of their way to bore you. Instead, small scenes of silence speak larger volumes. From simple shots of a pensive, love yearning, teenage girl gazing at the ceiling from bed, to more stupendous shots of sharing a literary quote while staring at the full moon, these scenes along with their gorgeous artwork highlight the subtle storytelling at play. Of particular note are the various dream-like sequences, which heighten emotional thoughts or climaxes with filters and sound-effects that give an emotional resonance, allowing the largely spoken-word screenplay to pull you around. As a character drama, After the Rain excels, with a fair if frequently somber and melodramatic emotional payoff by the end. But c'mon, if you're reading this far, you already know that this is a heightened melodrama. \n\nimg(https://66.media.tumblr.com/af0a9fb93485ff3d1af59e7c6267e438/tumblr_p2rwvhIx9d1wt5xqro2_540.gif)\n\nIt's when that character-analyzing melodrama ricochets over the more prominent romantic arc where things get tangled. After the Rain is inherently about Tachibana and Kondou, but because the show strings along the romantic aspect of the show, it ends up spending more time solving their personal problems without tying together their romantic disparities. It's the equivalent of going to see some shooting stars, but the sky is overcast; sure, maybe you can see glimpses through breaks in the clouds, but the payoff seems lackluster if your expectations were set on a more complete package. \n\nWhat can't be faulted is the artistry on display. The subtle yet lush animation delivered by Wit Studio is great, and a very big diversion from their typical Attack on Titan flair, leaning more in line with the quiet, almost magical prominence of something like Ancient Magus' Bride, with less of the overt fantasy overtones. The animation features straightforward but earnest visual metaphors to balance out the narrative itself, and harnesses some of the sleekiest animation in the industry for some really enthralling shots. Meanwhile, while the music is also enjoyable, its quite forgettable, beyond the stunning ED Re:frain by Aimer, which you would be a fool to skip at the end of every episode. \n\nimg(https://66.media.tumblr.com/607978dd76f462a93e4f5d2c6d407a94/tumblr_p6d6i9UZlB1v1hotuo2_500.gif)\n\nIf we are to judge a book by its cover, then how would one judge After the Rain after experiencing what it has to offer? While the premise is intriguing, the follow-through can leave a lot to be desired. While there is fantastic drama and realism within After the Rain, there is a lack of romantic bonding and execution on some of the narrative's core themes. And while After the Rain is certainly not a bad viewing experience, it might leave those who have high expectations leaving ultimately disappointed, not because the experience itself is unenjoyable, but because the execution was not as enlivening as it could have been under different circumstances. "}, {"id": 4251, "score": 50, "body": "Egao no Daika is a run of the mill mecha anime that does very little to stray from convention. The show attempts to explore the philosophical quandaries of war, however, it falls face first by approaching this issue on a fairly rudimentary level. The core philosophical stances this anime takes on war can be broken down into two basic points, war is bad and everyone in a war is human. While it may seem reductionist, it isn't, this show has such a generic message that you'd be hard pressed to find any piece of media related to war that doesn't have this message. Therein lies the problem, this show has very little reason to exist because these points have been illustrated in a far more entertaining and interesting ways than this show could ever hope to achieve. Aside from my gripes with the overall themes of the show there is very little redeeming that this show does. First and foremost the mecha fight scenes are uninventive and frankly boring in most cases. The show relies on ambiguous pseudoscience that's extremely unclear namely the chrars. The chrars are never explained as to what they even are, one is lead to believe they are energy cores of some form, however the show never goes into detail on how these operate or sets up any rules surrounding them. This ambiguity makes the final payoff of the plot completely meaningless and unfulfilling. The plot stumbles around after episode three and never seems to get back on it's feet till episode ten, as such everything that happened in between this time is pretty much a blur of boring plot points. The only thing that occurs in these episodes is that a few characters died and even this is uninteresting because after their death it makes one realize their utter unimportnace to everything going on because the plot just continues with little regard making you ultimately wonder why the character even existed to begin with aside from just pushing the plot along. With the exception of the main characters most of the characters within the show are all interchangeable, as such, they are uninteresting, utterly devoid of all personality and just melt into one bulbous mass of innocuous filler. The main characters are recognizable at  least, beyond that they aren't really developed in any meaningful way to make you understand them as people, which is ironic for a show trying humanize war.  All in all this show is a boring mess with middle school level philosophy and a cast of generic characters that doesn't bring anything interesting to the table that you haven't seen a million times in a countless number of other war related media."}, {"id": 4252, "score": 56, "body": "War is an awful thing and unfortunately humanity doesn't seem to want to slow down on it. There's no shortage of media that covers the horrors that come with it. Egao no Daika seeks to create its own take on the matter, and thankfully does so relatively well, and would be much more enjoyable if it wasn't for the quite weak technical side of the anime\n\nA large part of the anime are slice of life passages that seek to humanize the characters. Does it accomplish this goal? Absolutely. Does it do it convincingly? Not always. Outside of the main cast everyone feels like a plastic archetype or exclusively there for the purpose of furthering the show's goals. Unfortunately, everyone outside of Yuki, Stella and maybe the chief/commander character (who's forgettable enough to not serve any narrative purpose outside of adding on the Stella's character) is forgettable. This is partially because of the 1 cour format, and partially because the production team doesn't really seem to actually care about the anime. The anime is loaded with tragedy, and because of it being handled so frequently the execution is sloppy. Yuki, one of the two main protagonists, does not handle this well. She makes laughably poor decisions and as a result causes trouble for herself and the country. An idealistic view of the future during a violent, long war almost ruins her character in the first few episodes, and leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the viewer. Take another mecha/war anime, Code Geass, and see how the tragedy has a lot of tension, sadness, and borderline anger. The protagonist is legendarily well written and interesting to watch. Of course, comparing the narrative of a quite simple 12 episode anime and a massive, epic 50 episode anime with a plot twist every 3 episodes isn't necessarily fair, but comparisons to highly regarded anime is inevitable. The characters are purpose built to be human, and while it does succeed it unfortunately results in being flat and artificial. The characters that manage to avoid tragedy are unfortunately either boring or obnoxious, with often extremely poor character designs and poor voice acting. \n\nAnother unfortunate, and possibly the main downfall of the show is how little is actually explained. The military strategy is elementary and damn near insulting to the viewer, none of the science behind the tech and the big reason the war is the way it is (what are called chrars) is explained. None. Zero. It begs for the anime to be longer, but the main culprit is the clear and extreme lack of effort. This carries forward into the sound and visual design and production. The music, voices, and sounds are pretty much all fine. The animation is a different story. Especially near the middle and end of the anime, the art and animation are exceedingly lazy and feels amateur at best. The CGI used for the mecha fights is serviceable, again, until the end. This furthers the feeling of laziness and a lack of care put into the show. The technical side of the anime is an inconsistent and poorly run mess.\n\nWith the faults in account, Egao no Daika still manages to carry some charm. A recommendation is difficult when other options are available.

If you weren't a fan of Toradora! to begin with this probably isn't worth watching.\n\n# Review in full:\n\nToradora!: Bentou no Gokui is a zany one-off episode that focuses on Ryuuji early in the series. It shows a deterministic side of him that doesn't come up too often in the main series and gives the viewer a better idea of who he is and what drives him. However the plot feels a tad forced in that Ryuuji would have to be triggered pretty hard to push the episode's main dilemma like he does if we're going by what the main show told us. Within the main show he typically doesn't become competitive for its own sake, but here that's about all that can be drawn from the situation.\n\nThe way the main joke repeats itself doesn't make it as funny as the comedy in the main show either. In fact I can't recall any episode in the main show that recycled a joke as its main premise throughout its duration. It also doesn't help that most of Toradora! relied on and was seemingly built for story arcs that lasted 2-3 episodes. Perhaps this story could have been better if it had more room to develop. While the many characters present are generally themselves and the conclusion to the episode is nice, the episode as a whole just feels off-kilter.\n\n<center>img600(https://i.imgur.com/zeoTliR.png)\n_Discussing the meaning of bentou under the blooming sakura is such an anime land thing, but it also sums up the general tone of this episode._</center>\n\nLastly, Bentou no Gokui's general production quality is simply good enough for what it sets out to do.  The visual style is no different than Toradora! ever was, but there aren't any moments where particularly interesting camera angles or special animation changes are used like they were in the main show.  At least the sakura scene was nice.  Meanwhile the voice acting is just as lively & expressive as ever, but the episode sounds somewhat empty as far as music & SFX are concerned.  Of course both are entirely reused from the main show, it's just applied more sparsely than before, which is not to Bentou no Gokui's benefit.\n\n# Verdict:\n\nIt's a good thing they decided to skip out on this story in the main series as doesn't fit very well with the rest of it and would have thrown off the show's pacing. It's worth checking out if you wanted more Ryuuji though."}, {"id": 4266, "score": 60, "body": "Call it yuri bait, call it boring, call it whatever the hell you like. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only so much that shows of half-length episodes can bring to the table each week.\n\nWhile the low rating is quite understandable considering the context, Manaria Friends (also named Rage of Bahamut: Manaria Friends) is apparently a spinoff of shorts whose settings are based off of, if not in the same universe as, the Shingeki no Bahamut franchise that is produced and supervised by Cygames. It is by no means connected to the canon story of the aforementioned parent series, and its focus is mainly on two female leads, one of which (yea, I know) has a physical attractiveness so intense that it made her a \u00e2\u0080\u009clewdable\u00e2\u0080\u009d meme.\n\nSTORY:\nManaria Friends takes place within the aforementioned fantasy universe of Shingeki no Bahamut in an apparently renowned magic school known as Mysteria Academy. In this distinguished academic institution, enrolled members are taught all sorts of stuff regarding magic and the world revolving around it, regardless of their race or faction. Due to this lack of racial discrimination, the story quickly establishes that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no visibly ongoing conflict, at least within the academy, and is meant to bring a considerably more \u00e2\u0080\u009claid-back\u00e2\u0080\u009d atmosphere, compared to the more action and conflict orientated main story of Shingeki no Bahamut.. The attention is given to our two main heroines of the show: Grea, a Dragonborn, and Anne, a princess and prodigy sorcerer who also attends Mysteria Academy. \n\nThe typical generic settings of a fantasy world are apparent, but the show doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stray to either direction of right and wrong in that aspect, as it makes itself clear from the onset that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not conducting an overly elaborate matrix of world-building with tons of exposition. Because of this, it is clear that the prenotion of a deep story by the viewers would be quite disrespectful to the services of the series. The bread and butter of the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s premises is to mainly focus on the two\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationships and the dynamics of their social interactions with each other, which also includes showcasing particular activities or events that take place within the academy. Honestly, due to the half-life duration of each episode, the missing elements of plot development are not necessarily needed. It is almost completely slice-of-life (which amazes me as to why there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no tag for it on MAL), and the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s display of the ambient serenity should already be giving viewers the preconception of what to expect. The evolving display of Grea and Anne\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growing bonds and friendship, surpassing the constraints of racial differences, is meant to bring a calming sense of peace and beauty to the audience as they watch these shorts. There ARE a few instances of comedy, but not so much as to disrupt the nature of the story.\nOne more thing to note; there is almost no instance of action-based scenes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6save for episode 5, which I had mixed thoughts about. In that particular episode, monsters appear out of nowhere and lay siege to the academy, to the point where the inhabitants were close to their wits\u00e2\u0080\u0099 end and it was practically near a life-or-death situation. While it might be a purposely implemented change of pace, it can be perceived as a rather unnecessary derailment from the entire purpose of the series, even if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just for one episode. However, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give it the benefit of the doubt: that particular episode likely attempted to depict the constant reminder that the academy IS within a fantasy universe, where immediate danger can still be just around the corner.\n\nART and SOUND:\nThe animation is actually very nice and consistent, even though it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not nearly as flashy as something from Kyoto Animation or Ufotable. The sceneries, in particular, was given gracious amounts of fine detail and texture. Considering the nature of the story and that each episode is half-length, an adequate amount of quality was honestly needed, anyways. The overall bright colors and tones are meant to complement the ambience of peace and everyday life. The character designs are well-made, and the movements, while not entirely flawless, lack any signs of clunkiness or jarring CGI (thank god). The OST, while not entirely memorable, is calm and relaxing, obviously meant to complement the nature and visual art of the show.\n\nCHARACTERS:\nSince most of the attention is on Grea and Anne\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cunintentional flirting\u00e2\u0080\u009d, the character department does kinda suffer overall. The other characters, looking at it from face value, are just\u00e2\u0080\u00a6there. However, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re entirely useless. The worst case scenario would be showing Grea and Anne ALL ALONE in the god damn academy being left to their own advices (and God knows how much \u00e2\u0080\u009cviewers\u00e2\u0080\u0099-discretion-advised\u00e2\u0080\u009d content we would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve beheld, though not like some of us yuri fans would complain\u00e2\u0080\u00a6lul). The supporting cast are there to add the necessary details to the settings, like the sense of ongoing activities and other social interactions. They also function as third party devices to give more composition to our two heroines\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ongoing relationship. Needless to say, while the support cast could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been established much better, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not exactly useless at all.\n\nSo here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the brief summaries on our two lead girls:\n\nGrea is a Dragonborn, and essentially a demi-human. As her attractiveness and adorable personality can be pleasing to watch, she is a character I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve often found concern for from time to time; at the very least, she was a particular point of interest for me for the majority of the show. While there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obviously no sense of racial discrimination in the show, her shy nature often prevents her having proper conversations with most people, which even included her \u00e2\u0080\u009cbestie\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and she has some underlying feeling of anxiety. That also makes her a rather interesting character, when everything is said and done, because it makes me wonder if she had gone through some sort of traumatic experience in her past, possibly related to racial discrimination or even worse. I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be surprised if there existed any sources regarding her backstory, which we honestly never got, though that was to be expected from the start.\n\nAnne is apparently of royalty and is a talented sorcerer attending the Mysteria Academy. Despite her usual carefree, optimistic nature, and her mostly-one-sided flirting with Grea, she is also someone I invested a bit of curiosity in. At times, it felt like she was trying to avoid facing the reality of carrying out family royalty obligations, and the academy probably functioned as a getaway for her for obvious reasons. \n\nThe notion I had of Grea and Anne sharing similar underlying facets of concern and insecurity probably had me slightly more attached to them than what was needed, but in the end, it was a nice thing to have. Perhaps I may be too analytic in this regard, but with this notion in mind, I thought this gave more context and meaning to the two\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bonds and made it all the more enjoyable to watch the chemistry between them.\n\nENJOYMENT:\nTo me, enjoyment value is midline, because the show, as aforementioned, is meant to be a series of slice-of-life shorts, functioning as a nice \u00e2\u0080\u009ctimekiller\u00e2\u0080\u009d. The yuri vibes were really nice and not something excessively shoved in the face, so I have no objections for people going on about the shipping, though I sometimes worry about the memes getting outta hand. For me, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a nice thing to follow up on after watching a very serious and conflict-heavy episode from some other anime show or film.\nOVERALL:\nManaria Friends is not something I can easily recommend because of the overly serene nature that contrasts that of the main story of the franchise. As stated before, it is meant to be a nice timekiller, a different take to relieve one from the stress of what they were watching beforehand. Whether or not such a show with a singular selected purpose is right for you is ultimately your own decision. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be unethical to expect something extravagantly deep and serious from a show like this. So go ahead, make your choice. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re there for the memes, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fine, too.\n"}, {"id": 4274, "score": 59, "body": "When was the last time a light novel adaptation or isekai tried to be straightforward?

While the art style certainly feels unorthodox, a lot of the facial expressions are priceless and adorable as a result, particularly with Rimuru\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slime form. The sheer liveliness of some of the environments trumps even the likes of No Game No Life, which is arguably the most visually stunning isekai on the market. The show often experiments with different styles, like swapping between anime and photorealistic footage when getting us acquainted with Rimuru\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slime form in episode 1, or when he fantasizes about hot elves and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re drawn in a 90s aesthetic. Several moments in the show, along with the first ED, also add a sort of digital, VR-like filter to whatever\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening onscreen. Speaking of the first ED, the visuals for it change 4 times, and each version looks great. Even when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not experimenting, some of the action scenes and sequences of Rimuru wandering around in slime form look stunning and fluid. The first OP is a wonderful example of this. Sadly, the visuals are about as inconsistent as everything else. For every moment of smooth or lively visuals, we have moments of typical static shots, and episodes where we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get much animation. Some of the background and foreground scrolling tends to look awkward as well, and the rampant CGI tends to be even worse. Still, the character designs are generally great, and the high points in the animation put nearly every other isekai or LN adaptation to shame. Studio 8bit is probably one of the better sources of isekai anime out there.\n\nEven more vibrant is the music. Early on, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re treated to some fun chiptune pieces, along with some adventurous tracks. Somehow, the amount of more lighthearted and fun tracks, and even the amount of battle themes is completely overshadowed by the sheer volume of great emotional pieces. A track that perfectly exemplifies both sides of this is actually the first ED, \"Another colony\" by TRUE. The guitars and drums give this energetic vibe that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s both invigorating and a tad emotional, and the violins more than add to the more emotional aspect of the song. Along with the decent vocals, these elements turn this into one of the better EDs of 2018, and a great way to cap off each episode. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care as much for the second ED despite its more sentimental tone. Takuma Terashima does the 2 OPs of this season, and they are both fantastic. The first, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNameless Story\u00e2\u0080\u009d, is a striking tune, especially with that bombastic usage of the special guitar which gives a more rustic, perhaps 2000s vibe. The visuals accentuate that vibe, as both aspects of the OP meld to create both this sense of adventure and danger. The second OP, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMeguru Mono\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a far calmer, more emotional piece that shows just how far Rimuru and his civilization have come, and how wondrous things will remain in the future.\n\nAs expected from an isekai, the writing is a bit of a mess. The show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pacing is often strange, and it has a ton of pointless and bewildering time skips. Emotional moments often feel rushed or conjured out of thin air, and the show often forgets about its characters until they randomly appear later. Examples of the latter include the time when Gobta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just left alone in a cell halfway into episode 5 and forgotten about, or when the goblins and wolves are told to wait outside at the beginning of episode 4 and are forgotten about until episode 6, where we see them and a whole new batch of goblins working. The show also tends to resort to time skips, glossing over the progression of the central village Rimuru builds, and making the town\u00e2\u0080\u0099s progression and some of Rimuru\u00e2\u0080\u0099s absences feel utterly ridiculous. \n\nAnother problem is that the world-building is sometimes inconsistent and unexplained, like how Rimuru could only name like 50 or so goblins and one wolf before passing out in episode 3 and then 500 goblins in episode 6. The worst case of the latter is in episode 19 where the wolf Ranga suddenly has a strong partnership with Shion and pulls a flying ability out of nowhere, since the characters ask how and when he learned that and became that close with her, and we never get an answer. Granted, the world-building is never indigestible and rarely broken like it is in Mahouka or Smartphone. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just that these issues become especially distracting when the narratives are already rather unremarkable and badly paced. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even worse when most of the arc conclusions are drawn-out, anticlimactic, or cheesy, with the 4th arc\u00e2\u0080\u0099s finale being the worst example. That said, some of the storylines in this show are genuinely good. The best example of this is the 3-part storyline with Shizue at the end of arc 1, with its intense backstory and a sentimental payoff for Shizue and her ultimately tragic tale. If only more of this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arcs and mini-stories were as good as this or even the majority of the second arc, but inconsistency really is Slime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s middle name.\n\nA majority of the characters in this show are actual yes men, often with one defining character trait and only some level of chemistry to make them salvageable. Barring Rimuru (the little asshole), his internal sage assistant, and perhaps the utter dolt that is Gabiru, it seems like the best characters in this show are ones that appear for a short time, like Shizue, Veldora, or the trio of guild adventurers at the end of the first arc. They along with the characters I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve named often have the most entertaining personalities and chemistry, and the most we get from them are a few gags at Gobta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, Shion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and Rimuru\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expense. Almost none of them have any exceptional personalities or amazing chemistry to rival the GOATs in anime casts, nor do any of them necessarily wring any hype out of me aside from a character introduced in the penultimate episode. However, none of them are insufferable or horribly written. Still, this is probably Slime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weakest and least entertaining aspect. \n\nThe experience of watching this anime at its best is a lot like that of playing a Kirby game. It has an adorable, round, expressive protagonist who absorbs his enemies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 powers while exploring new lands, and a sense of whimsy crafted by the bouncy slime animation and wonderfully varied OST.

All it needed to do in order to not suck was just be straightforward and willing to entertain. \n\nWith that said, can we finally have a good isekai again, please? I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want another isekai ending with a recap episode, as amusing as this one was. (Yes, the recap is listed as its own anime now, but it was still advertised as the final episode by the show itself, and MAL did not list it as its own entry when this review was made. Fuck you, it's my review...you bullies.)\n\nWritten and Edited by: CodeBlazeFate\nProofread by: Peregrine"}, {"id": 4279, "score": 50, "body": " ~~~\n# **An army is a tool for violence, and there are two kinds of violence... Violence to control and oppress, and violence as a means of liberation.**\n***\n# **Attention: SPOILERS AHEAD**\nimg440(https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/401758812790325248/557596949142831134/legend_of_galactic_heroes_gay.gif)\n~~~\n***\nFirst things first: I think I now get the appeal of the fandom surrounding this work. The directorial differences to modern works, the reputation of the series, and sheer length of it prove as a barrier to entry to it that makes many that cross the boundary feel some kind of exclusivity to it all. There are not that many that finished the series, and having most conversations about it be in high praise about the show definitely lends that exclusivity feeling a nice air.\n\n**But**, I have few but intense grievances with the show that keep me from drinking the kool aid and going full circle jerk about the work, and I'll get to them first before I'll bring the post back home to the many aspects that are genuinely great about the show afterwards. So hang on tight for the next paragraphs, I promise to end the post on a high note.\n\n~~~**The Bad**~~~\n***\nFirst of them: For your own sake, please please always skip the previews. The narrator spells out exactly what happens in the next episode. There's no bait and switch like with some previews nowadays. You have been warned.\n\nIn a world where we hate on works like SAO for having endless, boring, and visually bland exposition dumps; it was impossible for me to overlook this with LotGH. Watching Monogatari alongside this show likely didn't help either. And this is not necessarily a critique on the dialogue writing part. High strung  aristocracy talk comes with the expectations, that's okay. Monogatari had it's fair share of technobabble and pretentious dialogue that is entirely out of place for high schoolers.\nThe show consists in overwhelmingly large parts of two or more characters talking at each other. But the cinematography and direction failed to stand the test of time. The visual language just doesn't carry the political and techno babble to a level where just watching the people converse would be interesting.\nTo be perfectly fair, *most* modern anime still has trouble creating great blocking and composition for exposition scenes, but some gems like the fence discussion in the first episode of The Promised Neverland (with truly great blocking from 12:00 onward), exist.\nOr my personal benchmark for an interesting conversational scene would be the final confrontation between Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman in the 2008 movie Doubt, where the camera and actors are like in a dance with each other.\n\nThis leads me to another directorial blunder which the series repeatedly makes. Every few episodes, there will be a scene which is entered and left without leadin and leadout time. And they're almost exclusively conversations. I once literally caught myself wondering what the fuck happened when the episode went from one conversation cutting to an entirely different one between Phezzani or Republic Alliance citizens (can't quite remember) without lead-in time jumping straight to the meat of conversation, and leaving as fast as we entered back to the scene that preceded it. I wondered: who are these people, where does this scene come from, how does it fit contextually with the scene surrounding it?\nThankfully though, this happens less than the harsh tone of the paragraph might suggest. I wouldn't be surprised if you'd call this a nitpick of mine.\n\nThe last of my big gripes, and an entirely personal one, with the series would be, that the whole package, the execution, just didn't land as well for me as it surely has for a great deal of viewers. With exception of the things I already stated above, I can't quite put my finger on why that is. I went into the series promising myself that I'd watch at least one episode per day, which I later bumped to two, seeing as it would just take too much time for me. I largely sticked to that schedule, but there definitely were stretches of time where I had dreaded the need to watch more episodes, where I already forgot all of the political babble from the day before. Never enough for me to consider dropping the series, but I'd lie if I would say I enjoyed the entire ride.\n\n~~~**Minor Gripes**~~~\n***\nI could not help but be bugged about the stark contrast between their capacity for faster than light travel, and the large spans of time they spend traveling from system to system. But I recognize that the story structure did not provide any elegant solution to this problem. True warp would deflate any sense of tension and urgency in battles when you could just instantly call for reinforcements. But the need for the tech to exist is there, if you want realistic distances between systems, and travel within normal human lifespans between them to be possible.\nBut, why did they never distinguish between normal and ftl travel? Is there even a difference? If so \u00e2\u0080\u0094and the moving of Geiersburg Fortress, and the visuals accompanying it suggest so\u00e2\u0080\u0094 why did no one consider using warp for escape/pursuit or use as a relativistic kill vehicle?\nTo be fair though, these problems plague most space operas, and in the big scheme of things it's no big deal. It's only if you **break** established conventions like The Last Jedi did, using that Rebel ship as a relativistic kill vehicle, which then in turn calls all preceding space battles and the lack of the use of that tactic into question.\nIn that regard, by never distinguishing a difference between normal and ftl travel, and never bringing relativistic kill vehicles up, LotGH at least stayed consistent with itself, hence this only being a minor gripe.\n\nConsidering that the work is set thousands of years in the future, the exclusive adherence to traditional gender roles, and at times a bit misogynistic views are a bit odd. This dawned on me by episode 100, where the new Galactic Empire higher ups debate about succession rights and women's role in that aspect. By series end it looked like Reinhard and Hilda had differing views on that though. And all in all the latent misogyny in LotGH can be chalked up to it being an artifact of the time in which the work was written.\n\n~~~**The Awesome**~~~\n***\nOkay then, with the depressing stuff out of the way, let's get to the main dish.\n\nWhile I was indifferent to the classical score of the show for most parts of it, while most everyone loves the idea of it, there were times when they chose a fitting piece, where it really hit me. `E97's use for Gustav Mahler \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Symphony No. 3: I. Kr\u00c3\u00a4ftig. Entschieden` is such a case for me. Perusing Gineipaedia (where does this name from?), where they noted down the name of the pieces used with timecodes in every episode entry, turned out to be a nice classical music learning experience too.\n\nLet's face it. You're practically bound to cry, or come close to it, at least once if not more during the runtime of the show. With over 100 episodes of time to spend with some of the characters, and the high body count nature of the setting, you will have plenty of opportunity to get a window into the characters. You'll share their joys and sorrows, and will inevitably get heartbroken when they die.\nFor me, considering my gripes with overall execution of the series, this was mainly only the case when Yang found his end. It was so sudden, un-glorious, and painful to watch. Bleeding to death in total solitude alone with his resting thoughts. Killed by an unnamed character without a fight.\nBut what made this one character death stand out from among the prominent ones was how this was the only occasion where the atmosphere shift really reached me. The show really took a bunch time for us to share some intimate moments of mourning with the bereaved.\nEspecially with Frederica, long having deduced Yang's demise from the behavior of the people surrounding her, took me by surprise with her calm demeanor at first. But the emotional breakdown when after she had the confirming conversation with Julian and the viewer gets to be alone with her and her tears, was all the more painful as a result.\nThey were torn apart from each other after less than a year of marriage, with only a few short months of quaint and peaceful family life together in that time. And what Yang told to her about not being deserving of familial happiness because of his tremendous guilt and inflicted death and destruction as a military commander \u00e2\u0080\u0094also where his drinking \"problem\" stems from\u00e2\u0080\u0094 turned out to be a prophecy. I like to imagine that this tragic thought swirled around in Frederica when she finally broke down.\nThankfully though, my heart was then mended in return when the Cazelnu family invited her over for a wholesome dinner.\n\nAlthough I lost interest in the political aspects of the show when It became obvious to me that by necessity of needing Reinhard to remain in the plot, the show would be a bit less critical of authoritarian forms of government than I would have hoped, the main messages that the show is not shy of hammering into the audience's head over and over and over again are timeless, and arguably really relevant in this exact time.\nSeeing how many nations across the globe are somehow regressing back into nationalism, LotGH is certainly a great way to remind oneself of the pitfalls of it. The creators dealt with nationalism and religious extremism in a straight forward manner and were not afraid to show what they thought about it. They're shortsighted schemes that thrive on hate to mute and control the populace. The nationalistic leaders of the Free Planets Alliance doom their nation into collapse through a failed invasion into the Empire \u00e2\u0080\u0094for which they built public support by feeding nationalistic zeal\u00e2\u0080\u0094 losing millions of soldiers only for the sake of remaining in office.\nOr during the episode where Julian is watching a documentary about the Goldenbaum Dynasties history, to which the quote of Yang Wen-Li in the title of this post alluded to: An army is a tool for violence, and there are two kinds of violence... Violence to control and oppress, and violence as a means of liberation. You know what we call a national army is fundamentally the former example. It is a pity, but history does not lie. When those in power confront popular opposition, there are not many examples of the army siding with the people. Far from it, in the past in country after country, the army itself evolved into a power structure and came to control the people with violence.\nWe get a pretty good display of what can result when nationalistic demagogues abuse military power.\nIn the end, while almost all characters show a certain patriotic pride for their nation, by the final episode, all the hardliners and zealots got the short end.\n\nAnd then there's the best character in the show, Paul von Oberstein, because he is just such a brilliant antihero. Hidden behind his calm and stoic attitude and these cybernetic eyes was always the pure intent to bring and end to the Goldenbaum Dynasty and see Reinhard thrive. He used the apparent ambiguity of his intentions to serve as a bearer of blame and hate for despicable things that, in the end, Reinhard made the final decision on most of the time. This happened most prominently with the massacre on Westerland, which turned out to the most beneficial result it could have for Reinhard and his followers. This had the result of rallying the entire population of the empire behind him against the remnants of the Goldenbaum Dynasty, but leaving Reinhards image of the benevolent dictator largely unscathed, as Oberstein took the full brunt of the blame.\n***\nSo, that's it. These are my thoughts on the show that I could scramble together at this point. I don't care too much about making some deep point obscured by flowery prose to make this seem way more interesting than it is, but for everyone that read the whole thing I want to thank you!\n\nHave a lovely day.\n***\n**Disclaimer: I'm not a friend of scoring, therefore I left the score at the default setting.

We immediately dive back into the relationship between Iroha and Tsutsui and watch as it continues to grow on a time constraint, since according to Iroha she will be moving away in a few months time...but naturally, she actually has a 'bug' in her brain that will need to be operated on, and will result in either a loss of memory or death. We watch Ayano struggle to come to terms with the fact that her senpai Ito is in love with her, and eventually see them become a couple as well. Ishino and Takanashi soon become a couple after building upon their previous experiences together and really play into the 'opposites attract' trope. We even get to experience some real life problems that young couples go through, such as sex, compromise, and the true concept of love.\n\nWith our three main couples set, a time skip occurs in the final two episode to seven years in the future: Ishino and Takanashi are expecting a child and get married, Ayano has married someone unknown and left Ito to be a big shot in the anime industry, and Tsutsui is depressed and alone without Iroha, whom we find out survived her surgery but indeed lost her memories. Through the selflessness of her brother who we were led to believe at the end of season one would be competing with Tsutsui for his step-sister's romantic attention, she is reintroduced back to her former boyfriend and the two share in a moment that of course brings Iroha back her memories and loads with a happy ending that I will admit I cried upon watching.\n\nNow, this might all sound like diet Golden Time, and it kind of is, but there is still a charm here that I wasn't expecting. Iroha returning and regaining most of her memories through a realization that this complete stranger to her radiates a love deep to his core is actually very touching, and shows off just how much Tsutsui has grown through the series. He is no longer doubtful of the love he has for Iroha or the love she had for him -- it's something that weighs on him everyday of his life as a grown adult. \n\n3D Kanojo S2 is not without it's faults as it is improves upon its disastrous first season of animation...but not by too terribly much. A lot of the movements continue to look stiff, some character definitely appear off model at times, and really it felt like once again I was watching something that a group of animators either didn't have a lot of time for or just didn't care to do their best with. However, stronger voice acting performances and a much better plot really saves the day, even without Iroha's brother playing as big a role in the season as was teased prior. It's humor still isn't super great and it's music leaves a lot to be desired...though, it improved quite a bit in the OP/ED department! \n\nAll in all, 3D Kanojo S2 is a huge step up from it's first season, and really can be seen as a guilty pleasure for me. The second half is a treat and the final two episodes pack real emotions that while some may find contrived, others will feel genuinely shaking their soul. It's not great, but it's most certainly not bad -- hopefully we can all find some 3D love like that shared between Iroha and Tsutsui.

A large chunk of the show was filler because it didn't matter what happened during a big event in the show when Subaru just dies and restarts. \"No, but it's good because it introduces a new concept to the Isekai genre and it's executed well because the character can figure out how to solve the conflict when he dies,\" You know, I thought that too, but when we are given 5 episodes taken place inside the Roswaal mansion and the main character is painfully slowly figuring out the problem doesn't make sense. So, without further adieu, let me explain to you why Re:Zero does not deserve the 10/10 rating.\n\n(Light spoilers ahead so be weary, nothing too extreme though)\n\n(Also, I'm writing this as I think of more things to say, thus why these topics are in no clear order)\n\nAs I mentioned in the very beginning, this show has almost no development for characters like Emilia, which is one of the main characters, which makes the opposite of sense. Tell me you know something about Emilia other than that she looks like the Witch and she's a candidate of the Royal Selection, go on, I'll wait. To call someone a main character and give them the opposite treatment as any main character should get makes the opposite of sense. Piggybacking on this idea of \"supporting characters get more development,\" in episode 11 titled \"Rem,\" we get a full backstory on both Rem and Ram. Both Rem and Ram are supporting characters, however, and the fact that we get development on them instead of A MAIN CHARACTER, doesn't make too much sense. I am glad that we did get this development because we could later empathize with Rem when she puts herself down about not being as powerful as her sister. \n\nAnother thing I wish to mention is its copious amounts of death seen from episode one to twenty-five. Episode one is when we first are smacked in the face with this world that Subaru is transported into and what his power is: to Return by Death. But the problem is, we didn't get to know the characters all too well before this happened, the first death happens so quickly, it's hard to sympathize with Subaru. He dies before he even gets any development. Not only this, but Subaru dies a total of 3 times before the first conflict is resolved. There's a thing about death that's truly fascinating: experiencing death every once in a while is shocking and heartbreaking, especially after we get to know the person that's died. The problem lies in when it happens 13 or so times in a rapid succession, the deaths become annoying after the first one or two times. This is because it happens so many times that it doesn't become shocking. It becomes extremely less shocking once we realize that whatever he did before he dies doesn't matter because he just goes back to when the conflict he has become a part of first starts. The only thing that changes when he dies is that now he knows how to fix what happened before he died. I suppose this is an interesting concept, but did Subaru have to die so many times? I think the series would have been much better if he died less than the number of times he died in the series already. This way he wouldn't die at least once every episode, and the deaths may become shocking depending on when they happen, what the scenario is, and how much we know the character.\n\nNow, after reading these two paragraphs, you may be asking yourself, \"Why did he rate this a 5/10 when it seems like he truly hates this show?\" I'll tell you why this show got a 5/10: Re:Zero definitely had its good parts. My first two paragraphs are just barely scraping the surface on what this show did wrong. I could have talked about how the exposition lasted for an incredibly long time or how Subaru and Emilia aren't the most likable characters in this series, but I don't want it to seem like I completely despise this show. So now it's time to back away from the greens and get into the pudding of this review. The next thing I wish to talk about, its truly good moments. I'll start off by talking about the smaller stuff. The art definitely took the show in a positive direction, this show had great character designs. Although its use of shadows was sometimes unnecessary, I won't let that take me away from how they made the city and the characters look. The music and sound design as well definitely made this show look good. Neither they didn't rely on super sappy piano music for the \"sad\" parts, nor did they rely on super intense music for the action parts. You could really tell that they weren't trying to force emotion out of you which I really appreciate. Some of the episodes were actually really good, some weren't entirely filler and I really enjoyed the entire battle of the White Whale. There was one episode that truly stood out from the rest, however. Episode 18 titled \"From Zero\" was the greatest episode of this entire series. Episode 18 was purely a conversation between Subaru and Rem, and might I say, it was the conversation that made Subaru's character make sense. It was the most developing episode in the entire series and was the catalyst to Subaru's character arc (something which I enjoyed considering throughout the first half of the series he was pretty unlikable.) We got to see Subaru's sensitive side when he's not trying to be the hero. This episode is what I truly watched the series for, I was waiting for an episode where Subaru would change and that's what we got. That is why episode 18 is truly the greatest episode in Re:Zero.\n\nSo, what else is there to say about this series? It had its moments. It was enjoyable at times, but when you take into account the lack of character development, slow development of the plot, and unlikable characters (among other things), the show goes from an easy 8 or 9 to a 5 or a 6. I enjoyed this show to an extent, this show was quick to grab my attention from the first few episodes, but over time I just wanted things to progress faster. Thus why this show does not deserve the 10/10 or 9/10 rating everyone thinks it deserves. \n\nMY FINAL RATING: 54"}, {"id": 4327, "score": 50, "body": "Himegoto is a gold anime if you like traps and think things like that are funny. \n\nThe plot is kinda blend since the episodes are very short. I think the show manages to tell much about the different characters even if the episodes are short. The episodes ends very fast. but i think they did a good work on making the most out of the episodes, even though there are little to no character developement.\n\nThe description of the show tells most of the main plot.\nThe main protaganist is a slave of the student council and have to do some weird jobs, but gets closer and closer with the girls in the council. Meanwhile, his brother is jealous of the student council keeping him, and with help from two traps and a reverse trap, tries to win him back. \n\n In the first episodes there are mostly introductions to the different characters, but the plot deepens later and things get heated up. It really reminds me of a slice of life anime, but with a plot twist.\n\nSome things in the show might be kinda inappropriate, like hime almost being sold of as sex slave or some of the jokes. The show is really good at the ending and makes you really happy. \nThe characters are cute and drawn good. It is typical archtypes and their desig is typically cast design, with weird coloured hair and unique personality.\nA main protagonist with a bunch of girls, and a caring little sister(?) fighting for his onii-sans affection\nFor plot, the main plot is traps, but other than that it is just like a slice of life anime with cute girls(?) doing cute things, just like old mama used to make. The show is a little ecchi with some panty shots (mostly guys panties but) \n\nThe show is a nice show if you just want to watch something short and funny. \n\nThe only thing i can complain about is how short the episodes are, cause all of this could just be merged into like 2 normal episodes.

From cinematic, adult-oriented realist narratives which are the bulk of Yoshihiro Tatsumi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s oeuvre to avant-garde surrealistic film/music-mishmash expressions a la Seiichi Hayashi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s *Sekishoku Elegy*, the gekiga movement sought to go beyond the Disney-inspired creations of Osamu Tezuka which were primarily aimed to a younger audience. Yet despite this rise of \u00e2\u0080\u0098alternative comics\u00e2\u0080\u0099, Matsumoto was considered a unique, and sadly, overlooked artist within his peers, and ultimately within the canon of manga.\n\nInspired by the films of the world-renowned Yasujiro Ozu, Matsumoto illustrates bite-sized panels reminiscent of the trademark \u00e2\u0080\u0098pillow shots\u00e2\u0080\u0099 often seen in the director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work, as well as the short, mundane exploits of the everyday Japanese urban person\u00e2\u0080\u0094which work in contrast to the dark, edgy, themes of his contemporaries. Unlike the 1970s trend of tragic, Japanese New Wave-inspired dramas reflecting the struggles of young adults, Matsumoto portrays a more nuanced and grounded side of society, telling seemingly insignificant vignettes of the average 4.5-*tatami* room tenant, whether it be a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s woos for the woman in the cigarette store, the interactions of a condom-selling lady with her customers, or an office worker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s romantic struggles represented by the red high-heels she borrowed from the shoe repair store.\n\nAs such, it is not hard to realize why Matsumoto was unappreciated during his time. Amid the revolution of manga\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cultural landscape of conflict-driven protagonists, Matsumoto himself remained faithful to his style, and even differentiated from the term \u00e2\u0080\u0098*gekiga*\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (dramatic pictures), calling his output \u00e2\u0080\u0098*komaga*\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (panel pictures). It is also unfortunate that, at the time of this writing, Matsumoto and his work remains largely ignored by the English-speaking community, despite the global attention given to his colleague and rival Tatsumi, who also leads the foreword of this anthology.\n\nIn his foreword, Tatsumi recalls:\n\n>What Matsumoto had was the ability to use a subtly humorous naivet\u00c3\u00a9, especially in the drawing of genial average people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lives, to bring out their charm. Looking back over Matsumoto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work again after thirty years, the pathos of the man at the time of publication comes through bright and clear. (November 2010)\n\nMatsumoto may have been forgotten, but the essence and timelessness of his themes remain resonant. The lighthearted and subtly comedic approach of his work makes an interesting outlier within *gekiga*, and in many ways it might have been the progenitor of the contemporary slice-of-life we have gotten to know. I would personally recommend this to readers interested in the history of manga, but other people looking for something different might also find some value out of it."}, {"id": 4356, "score": 55, "body": "\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was meh\u00e2\u0080\u009d, that's some words I hoped to not have to say after the amazing experience I had so far going through the franchise, even despite the issues I had with the first season of this entry that were saved more than enough by the positives, but Max Heart in my opinion is a sequel that doesn't provide enough freshness to feel necessary to be there.\n\nThe biggest change compared to its prequel is the introduction of Hikari, another girl with powers (but not considered a Precure) that fully focuses on supporting abilities for the girls, not being able to properly fight like Honoka and Nagisa do. Her calm and quite adorable personality is likeable, but she isn't particularly memorable IMO, and the show is once again carried by the main duo\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 that start to suffer from just the length of the series being too much for the depth of their characters, with 50 episodes it was more than enough for the fantastic development of their friendship, and in Max Heart it kinda becomes an overkill with some episodes feeling too similar to things already done previously because there isn't that much more to do for them.\n\nThe biggest negative in any case is definitely the villain side, Precure is a franchise that has some really lovable and/or memorable villain characters that bring a lot to the series, but that's not the case for Max Heart, they are just so forgettable and outside of the pretty funny Uraganos there is nothing I can even think of to describe the other evil characters, something I can't even say to the already underwhelming baddies from the second half of the original\n\nWith the significant negatives said, here come the good parts. The art got a solid improvement that was quite noticeable through the whole run, the action looks as nice as usual, and well, despite the staleness the series suffers from, Nagisa and Honoka are still great nonetheless. More importantly I have to admit that I was very satisfied with the conclusion of the story, something that saved quite a lot my opinion on this sequel.\n\nimg800(https://i.imgur.com/xNbq5yG.gif)\n\nI honestly wouldn't recommend much this sequel despite the still relatively positive score I gave to it unless you absolutely loved the first season or its been a good time since you watched it, the repetitiveness is very noticeable and I'm sad that I can't just go full fanboy as anyone reading my reviews on the franchise most likely sees me as, I can see people finding Max Heart outright terrible if they don't think that Nagisa and Honoka are as good as I do because they are what keeps this sequel entertaining enough to keep going in my opinion."}, {"id": 4363, "score": 50, "body": "First of all, there's...a painful averageness about this anime. I wouldn't call it particularly bad, but I wouldn't call it good, either. I wouldn't stop someone from watching it but, at the same time, I wouldn't encourage someone to watch it either.\n\nThere's definitely some level of potential underneath the surface of this anime, but I feel the same way about it as I did with B: The Beginning. It should never have been 12 episodes, and suffers greatly from being so short, as it fails to cover certain things or elaborate on its plot enough in the time that was given.\n\nThere were a couple episodes where they focused on different characters than the main cast. While broadening the cast would be a good thing, and while I'm sure that those characters are essential to the source material, they serve no purpose. One episode in particular introduces 3 new characters who are clearly enemies - or, potentially, enemies - that never get seen again.\n\nThe plot itself has some interesting stuff about it. There are tons of demonic weapons throughout the earth that basically possess their users and turn them into evil beings whose entire goal is to kill. Some people aren't immediately taken over by those weapons and can harness their powers to fight, but will eventually turn into those demons themselves. There is an organization whose goal is to gather these weapons and keep them out of humanity's hand. They work with these not-yet-demon humans to find and store them.\n\nThe main character sucks balls, and the series is barely kept afloat by its somewhat interesting side cast. Gai, the titular MC, was born holding one of these demonic swords after his mother, while pregnant with him, was possessed by one and she decided to kill herself. He's cold to everyone, treats even the people who care for him like garbage, doesn't benefit from MC power ups, and just...sucks. It's hard to be invested in him as a character, or his story, given that he has pretty much no development in 12 episodes.\n\nHonestly, I think with a second season the show could be pretty alright, maybe even good depending on where it goes. It certainly ended well enough for me to want to read the source material, but...there's no translations available, so scratch that, I guess."}, {"id": 4367, "score": 50, "body": "Oh boy, where do I even start with this one? This series is a mess; realistically, it deserves lower than a 5, definitely a 4 and maybe even a 3. The concept of the series is a joke, one that could have been entertaining: in Japan, there is something known as an 'idol dietwoman,' who serves both as a politician and an idol. It's certainly unique, but at the same time, I can't really think of anything that would have made it better than it was.\n\nLet's start with the things to its credit, and why it earns a 5 despite being notably worse. The characters, while nothing extraordinary, are at least pretty fun. The main character, Natsuki, gives off genki vibes, but she has just as many moments of airheadedness or clear flaws. She's not exceedingly happy in all situations, which, especially in idol series, usually just builds up to one breakdown that hits 'hard' because we're used to the complete opposite. \n\nOn top of that, some of the episodes were pretty entertaining. The opposing party to the Idol Dietwomen, the Rougai Party, continuously comes up with these random, crazy plots to try and discredit the idols. The show doesn't have any cohesive plot, for the most part showing the idols solving regular politican problems through the power of music. The songs are pretty good, and while there isn't anything necessarily memorable about them, they were at the very least a joy to listen to.\n\nAs for the bad...well, pretty much everything else. The animation is nothing to write home about, and while it isn't necessarily horrible, it's not really good, either. The characters can go from being gorgeous in one scene to looking jank or even 'stretched out' in the next. The plot, when the show tries to have one, is all over the place. In the latter half, they ramp up the \"opposing party\" thing, with the Rougai party kicking up their tactics to the next level and veritably trying to shut down the idols rather than simply discredit them.\n\nExcept that it really falls apart when it tries. There's no logical conclusion; the things that they do in the end should have been the things they did in the beginning. The series should have started near where it ended, and built the rest of the series off of that, rather than \"have 8 episodes of completely unrelated stuff. Oh, wait, we have a story now.\" The series has too many characters and doesn't really give the time to build any of them up...and, sadly, this ends up afflicting the main cast, as well. There's very little in the way of development for the main characters, which makes the progression even less believable.\n\nOverall, the series is a chaotic mess. It might appeal to people who don't value a cohesive plot as much as I do, but even then, the individual episodes don't really give as much satisfaction as other plotless shows might. I wouldn't really call it a complete waste of time to invest the time into watching it, as it does have some good moments here and there. I just feel like that time would also really be better spent on something else.\n\n[The ED is pretty lit, though.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSgDRsjLnes)"}, {"id": 4377, "score": 67, "body": "\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Quintessential Quintuplets\u00e2\u0080\u009d is not a weird-strange title. Rather, this is a harem show, a genre I always avoid. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get me wrong, I like this genre. I have an interest in it, especially \u00e2\u0080\u009cD-Frag!\u00e2\u0080\u009d as my favorite harem anime and manga. One reason why I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really like this genre is that it always takes the same format. It recites tropes and stereotypical \u00e2\u0080\u009calmost\u00e2\u0080\u009d the same as one and another anime. Every year, there would be harems that are based on either from a manga or light novel. One of them is this anime which probably everyone talks about. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 well\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 a decent personal show harem but somehow, this anime managed to suck me into it.\n\nBriefly, this is a story about Fuutarou Uesugi who is a tutor to rich sweet girls. It starts with a misunderstanding meeting scene but then wraps up with a misadventure story throughout the episode. Incidentally, these girls are twin sisters who have various personalities. Fuutarou is different from other main characters of harems show. He is not stupid but an idiot yet also insensitive but genius. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s okay to start out with something, something great but interesting. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, Fuutarou is probably the luckiest person in the world or even in an anime universe.\n\nFor Fuutarou, there was no other reason than to get money from being a tutor for these five girls. With the help of his sister and father who supported him, he tried to achieve anything and did not care about other things. Such a simple plot then wrapped with a series of harems in general. The impression is so charming, colorful, and full of sweet. On the other hand, the five girls, over time, fell in love with their respective tutors. This simply plots then races into a pentagon of love, the exact word or maybe ridiculously. The longer, insensitive Fuutarou then looks at them from another perspective and starts to open his feeling to them.\n\nAnd yes, this is a seasonal anime. Likewise with waifu everywhere. This anime has colored characters and also waifu-able. Thankfully, you can choose anyone with having a unique design, personality, and their efforts to reach Fuutarou. Let \u00e2\u0080\u0098s start with Miku Nakano, the first girl who ties a connection to Fuutarou. Although the story starts with the introduction between Itsuki and Fuutarou, Miku is the first candidate. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beautiful- definitely -cool, but a little shy. I think this is what makes the community immediately fall on her and is a strong candidate for this \u00e2\u0080\u009cbest girl\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Plus, she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look smart but isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t good at cooking. However, her interest in Japanese history might be out of character. She wore a headphone, as a plus and a cool fashion for an ordinary anime like this.\n\nIchika Nakano is the oldest of all her sisters. She is very mature with her strange habit of sleeping naked. I mean, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weird. She is probably the one that has fantastic plots and is most often discussed. Her life was complex as an older sister but always taken away from her four sisters. Therefore, she always fought for herself until she achieved what she could do for her sisters. She had a side people could not be seen but Fuutarou could see from one eye which was hiding from her happy smile. Probably, Ichika is one of the most interesting not because of the character design but more than that.\n\nYotsuba, in my opinion, is one character with a plot that is still lacking. I mean, there was no other reason at the beginning except she had to hide her feelings for Fuutarou. But, the audience already knew. She is the most careless but most active and happy. With no exception, she is very energetic every day, an athlete, but her kindness makes her attractive. Nino is probably the most underrated character of all because people rarely refer to her other than Miku. She is described as a cruel queen to Fuutarou. She will do anything to get rid of Fuutarou from her kingdom. However, on the other hand, she has kindness for her sister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake and is one of the most compassionate behind her true nature. Regardless of which, she is good at cooking and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not uncommon for her to be open with Fuutarou.\n\nProbably, my most favorite arc and character in this show is Itsuki. Itsuki was initially shown with an energetic type of character after she first met with Fuutarou. She is the center of attention of all his sisters and is the one who often conflicts with Fuutarou. She is a fine girl, but this is a totally effective execution arc from the end of the episode. However, the impression is still vague and the plot often overcome by other characters. Just like Nino, she rarely looks in the show and also seems flat.\n\nSo in short, who are the strongest candidates? Who is the best? Who are the women in the photo? Oops. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know why the ending is a little weird or I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to explain it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not open to interpretation nor cliffhanger. I just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to explain it. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear, it seems there is a second choice.\n\nThe visual is one of the best and is also one of the matters. In fact, it was very difficult to distinguish the five girls. Fuutarou himself often fails in guessing. The five girls, besides having different designs, always tricked people and switching roles in several episodes. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s completely unique and a little\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 funny, I guess? Fuutarou is indeed an idiot and insensitive person. The soundtrack is filled with the sound of happiness and emotional drama. In addition, the voice actress really did a great job with those we have long known. Inori Minase, Miku Itou, Ayana Taketatsu, Kana Hanazawa, Ayane Sakura, and Yoshitsugu Matsuoka. All of them did a great yet fantastic job at this point.\n\nI do have to say, this show sometimes makes me hate and annoyance which is a vague feeling I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t express. Maybe it lies with the main character or main heroines. But, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Quintessential Quintuplets\u00e2\u0080\u009d ended with one of the most favorable harem anime of the year. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably always followed even by the manga, which I recently read right now, and brings a harem into an old yet fresh format. Maybe, just maybe, Fuutarou will get them all. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know and we will never know it. Feels likes the third person who imagines, imagines if you might get one of them. Am I right? Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lie! And yes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ridiculous to say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the best \u00e2\u0080\u009charem\u00e2\u0080\u009d anime ever. But, probably my most favorite genre but still a decent anime.

IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED THE SHOW YET, NO NEED TO WORRY.__\n\nGrancrest Senki is really the typical anime I would normally be a sucker for. I like the setting, I like the themes it talks about, the animation has it's moments and the art design is a style I tend to really like as well. \nSo... why didn't that anime convince me? \nWell, to me, there are 3 main problems.\n\n1) __The pacing__: is generally fast (which is not necessarily a bad thing, don't get me wrong) but in this case it really feels __too__ fast. Making key moments and important events fall flat because you don't have the time to get invested into what's happening, that it's already over. For example: wars sometimes lasting half an episode, characters appearing kind of \"out of nowhere\" and \"dying\" soon after.\n\n2) __The staging__ : is another problem this show has. Some moments that are very key to the story and/or the development of the characters fall flat due to poorly staged scenes, those moments look good on paper, they should've been really impactful. They could've made me \"woah\" at them, if they were not poorly executed. It definitely lacks that something to make it really impact you and feel the moment. I strongly believe that a better staging for those scenes would definitely have made the anime greater and less forgettable. \n\n3) __Censorship__ : Without even checking the source material (the light novel) I already guessed this anime had \"censored/toned down\" many things from it and after giving a quick glance at the manga, which is way more bloody, my guess was correct. Yes there is blood in the anime but it is really minimalistic, and it shows that they also cut out all the \"nudity/sexyness\" from it. Because in the manga, things can get pretty gore-y and sexy. But it's not always your typical ecchi fanservice, the nudity in the manga in some moments is justified to make the story feel more mature and trashy. (Don't get me wrong the manga definitely has some stupid fanservice) I think it's a shame because this story definitey is supposed to be a more mature, seinen type of anime. The anime kind of is stuck in the middle between aimed for young teens and kids to young adults. They should've gone the \"full seinen route\" like the manga adaptation did."}, {"id": 4391, "score": 65, "body": "__(This review includes the four special episodes that were aired after the first season ended. These special episodes are part of the story and serve as a bridge from the ending of the first season to the start of the second season.

If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re lucky, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t intend to tell you, since this is a review of the first season of Oreimo, not a reflection or diatribe about it as a whole.\n\nimg1000(https://i.imgur.com/0WpbpKe.jpg)\n\nThat being said, is Oreimo worth watching? Honestly, I believe it is worth the watch if you took the trouble to take the clicks to get to this review. For what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the best anime of the niche genre it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in (which isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t saying much). There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something more here than a slice-of-life about siblings that bond over little sister eroge. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a whole handful of characters outside of Kyousuke and Kirino that are well written. Oreimo is way more developed and well-written than other anime of the same niche. Again, that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t saying much, but I think the author of this light novel series is a good writer, no matter how dark and sinister his intentions ultimately are.\n\nOreimo is at its center is about the relationship between Kyousuke and Kirino, older brother and younger sister. Viewing from the clouds, we see the lives of both; Kyousuke, who purposely tries to live his life as an average Joe, mediocre to the core, and Kirino, who excels at everything she does (school, track, looks, etc.). Their relationship at the beginning of the anime is strained at best, with Kirino being openly hostile to Kyousuke. Their relationship suddenly changes when Kyousuke accidentally discovers one of Kirino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little sister-oriented eroge laying on the ground near their front door. With the cat out of the bag, Kirino makes a choice and tries to get Kyousuke to \u00e2\u0080\u0098understand\u00e2\u0080\u0099 her otaku hobby, and makes him give her \u00e2\u0080\u0098life counseling\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (which is really an excuse for her to either tell him to do something or for him to just hang out with her).\n\nimg1000(https://i.imgur.com/yxkH4bL.jpg)\n\nAfter Kyousuke \u00e2\u0080\u0098accepts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Kirino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hobby, Kyousuke (at the order of Kirino) starts playing little sister eroge to \u00e2\u0080\u0098understand the appeal\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of them. Kyousuke, finding out that Kirino has no friends to talk about anime or eroge too, gets her to sign up for a discussion group. From there, Kirino (and later Kyousuke) become friends with Saori and Kuroneko, two slightly more normal girls that Kirino can talk about anime and eroge to. After that, most of the series is the same: Kyousuke helping Kirino solve various issues pertaining to her (their parents finding one of Kirino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eroge games/one of Kirino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s normal friends finding out about Kirino being an otaku/etc.)\n\nimg1000(https://i.imgur.com/uL13K1C.jpg)\n\nOreimo has many great side characters. They are one of the best things about the show. My personal favorite is Kuroneko, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the friends Kirino makes online. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also Saori, who is also part of the online friend group; Ayase and Kanako, Kirino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s normal friends; and Manami, Kyousuke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friend. I like all of the side characters besides Manami, solely due to her being one of the plainest characters to ever exist in all of anime. The group dynamics that operate between Kyousuke and Kirino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friend group, from Kyousuke slowly becoming friends with both Kuroneko and Saori, to Kirino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strong, seemingly random, dislike of Manami, are one of the best executed things about the anime.\n\nimg1000(https://i.imgur.com/gg00oqo.jpg) img1000(https://i.imgur.com/826F8IB.jpg)\n\nFor as much as I enjoy Oreimo, there are serious issues with the anime. The main issue in my opinion is Kirino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0098perfectness\u00e2\u0080\u0099. I know anime is not supposed to be all that realistic, but am I supposed to believe that Kirino is a track star, a grade-A student, prominent fashion model, AND a dedicated otaku at the same time? God damn, does she even have time to sleep? And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just at the beginning of the anime. I know the author wanted to have Kirino be an overachieving character, but this is by far overkill. I can accept her being a track star and an otaku, an all-A student and an otaku, and so on. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t accept her being all four at the same time. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just ridiculous. This doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even include the book and anime deal she gets out of thin air during the middle of the season.\n\nThe other main issue is how accepting most characters are about Kirino and Kyousuke both playing little sister eroge. The most trouble Kyousuke gets is being decked in the face by his father. The problem is that afterward, he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really talk about it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost as he never heard his son saying that he loves playing little sister eroge and plays them on his little sister's computer. At least Ayase has a strong aversion to Kyousuke after \u00e2\u0080\u0098finding out\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that he likes to play little sister eroge. She still somewhat associates with him though afterward. I can understand Saori and Kuroneko being a little more \u00e2\u0080\u0098accepting\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of the hobby, but they should see from a mile (kilometer?) away that this can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t end well.\n\nimg1000(https://i.imgur.com/OdyKbNV.jpg)\n\nEven though Oreimo has some bad flaws and quite a grotesque story, I still find it enjoyable to watch. I really enjoy the characters and the whole absurdity of the anime itself. The author does have talent and shows some of it, which differentiates Oreimo slightly from other siscon garbage. \n\n__Before I end this review, I just want to remind you that the original last episode of this season is a cop-out ending. It isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t canon, and if you want to watch the second season, you should watch the special episodes that came out after the first season ended airing on TV. The specials are a way better wrap-up to the first season than the last episode, which again is not canon. The only reason I emphasize this is because I saw on Anilist that more people watched the second season than did the first season special episodes.__\n\nThe special episodes are the best part of the season anyway, due to them being more focused on Kuroneko. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just my bias though.\n"}, {"id": 4417, "score": 58, "body": "I went into Shamanic Princess knowing very little about it other than it had a short non-canonical crossover episode with Magic User\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Club, so I had no real expectations going into this. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to say that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m disappointed, but more just underwhelmed with it. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not saying that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bad by any stretch, but the series overall could have been much better with a few minor changes.\n\nThis 6 episode OVA follows Tiara, a special agent from the Guardian World, the home of mages, who has been sent to earth disguised as an ordinary high school student to recover the stolen Throne of Yord, a powerful mystical object which is the source of magic energy in the Guardian World. During her hunt for the Throne of Yord, she discovers that it has a terrible secret when some of her friends and colleagues from the Guardian World fight to keep her from retrieving it.\n\nThis series has a lot going for it. It has good animation and art, a decent premise, a great soundtrack by Yoshikazu Suo that is appropriately moody and fits the series well, and has an darker atmosphere and themes that could drag you in if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something that especially appeals to you. But as I mentioned earlier, it does have a few problems that just prevent it from being a great series instead of just being an OK one.\n\nFor some reason, the first four episodes of this series seem to really rush through it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plot. As if either the series didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the budget or time to properly flesh it out. One scene goes to another without any real transition and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really give any breathing room, making the pacing of the show just feel off. By the time you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve realized what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already half way through the scene. There is even a plot point early on where out main character goes to a human high school to fit in as to not arouse suspicion that goes nowhere. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably why those first four episodes are so confusing and hard to keep track of at first, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too busy rushing through it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own story. Maybe the series could have done with at least one other episode just to give the series a better pace.\n\nMy biggest problem with this series are the last two episodes. Those last two episodes contain all of the character development and establishing plot points that lead up to the first four episodes of the series. Which begs the question, why are these last two episodes not the first two episodes? These two episodes feel like they were moved around just so the series could have some sort of twist at the end. If the people behind this series wanted to tell something out of order, they could have had these two episodes be flashbacks placed at certain points throughout the series. At least that way, it would have given the rest of the series a better pace, and it still could have lead up to some sort of \u00e2\u0080\u009ctwist\u00e2\u0080\u009d if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what the creators wanted.\n\nShamanic Princess isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a bad series by any stretch, but the idea to have the last two episodes be where they are really drags down the series as a whole, making it more confusing than it needs to be, and the series as a whole would have been much better if they were located somewhere else. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend Shamanic Princess to anyone who like their series with some darker themes and more atmospheric presentation."}, {"id": 4422, "score": 50, "body": "Sword Art Online: Ordinal Scale is the best movie about Augmented Reality since compilation videos of people falling off of things playing Pokemon GO. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two hours of all your favorite things associated with SAO: underdeveloped characters, Gary Stu Kirito, nonsensical plot, a villain with ridiculous motivation, and the romantic equivalent of watching a pickle and a pickle in a wig make out.\n\nIt starts promising enough. Kirito and the Trope Troop are into a new piece of technology called an Augma that is pretty much Google Glass. It allows you to play a fantasy video game in the real world while walking around town, earning promotions and such for ranking up in game. At this point in the movie I was pretty happy and content. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a decent idea, even if I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ridiculously far-fetched to think that this type of technology would be used en masse after the events of SAO.\n\nSpoilers ahead for those of you who actually want to sit through this dumpster fire.\n\nIt turns out that the guy who created the Augma has sent out a former SAO player to beat up players in the real world so that the monsters inside the fantasy game defeat the player and said player loses his memory. Because the bad guy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plot is to steal the memories of former SAO players, upload them to a database, and recreate his daughter who died during the SAO incident using said memories.\n\nThis begs a number of questions. First of all, if this technology has the capacity to steal memories and leave a person with irreparable brain damage, why the fuck was it allowed on the market? After the SAO incident, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d think anything that is able to connect directly to the brain would be vetted extremely well (but apparently they still sell Amuspheres...because those things weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the cause of 4000 deaths or anything).\n\nSecondly, if you have the technology to steal people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s memories and upload them as data, why not just copy their memories? That way you can recreate your daughter without going to all the trouble of having people get defeated by monsters before you can steal the memory.\n\nThird, why are SAO players playing Ordinal Scale? After being trapped in a life-or-death video game for so long I have a hard time believing that nearly every SAO player would happily pick up anything that transports them to a virtual world. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I nearly died playing a video game, but fuck it! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m gonna keep playing video games that are out to kill me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFourth, why can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the bad guy remotely steal the memories? If he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to steal them, why go to all the trouble to have the player be defeated by a boss monster when you could just figure out who is an SAO player, tag them, and steal their memory remotely? In fact, this would make a lot of sense considering I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll assume that not every player of SAO who was trapped in-game is from the immediate city area Kirito and friends are at. Or maybe SAO was only released to a tiny demographic of people in a tiny portion of Japan to make plot happen in future arcs.\n\nFifth, why steal the memories of every SAO player in order to recreate your daughter as an AI? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to assume that the vast majority of players didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know her, let alone remember who she is. This point alone makes the plan so stupid I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take the last half hour of the movie seriously.\n\nThe catalyst for the rising action of the movie is that Asuna is defeated and starts losing her memories. So Kirito goes out of his way to defeat the bad guys and return the memories stolen from her. Because the catalyst for the action hinges on my suspension of disbelief surrounding circumstances found in a sci-fi b-movie from the 80s, the emotional resonance that is meant to be felt for Kirito\u00e2\u0080\u0099s desperate struggle for his fiancee is lost entirely.\n\nThe end of the movie has Kirito confronting the \u00e2\u0080\u009cassassin\u00e2\u0080\u009d character sent out by the main bad guy to do the dirty work. He was in love with Yuna, the daughter of the villain. In a fight for the memories of his future wife and payback for the pain she has been put through...Kirito turns on the AR device and fights the dude in AR. They are both physically present inside the room. They could both duke it out man-to-man. But that wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be stupid enough. So here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a sword fight in a parking lot.\n\nThen it turns out that in order to return everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s memories, the characters have to defeat the 100th floor boss of SAO. This makes sense because the movie needs to have a pathetic attempt at emotional manipulation by forcing all the heroes of the series to show up to fight a monster inside of a game they thought they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never return to. So as they do a deep dive using their AR headsets (Why can the Augma be used as a deep dive device? Because fuck you!), their clothing is changed to reflect their \u00e2\u0080\u009ciconic\u00e2\u0080\u009d outfits. Cue the fan favorite side characters who show up to help out for no reason. Cue up Yuuki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ghost manifesting. And cue the theater full of teenagers crying and clapping hysterically because they recognize things. Because we are at a point in human history where merely recognizing things is enough to trigger emotional responses from people.\n\nAnyway, the final plan for this guy was to get all of the former SAO players to show up to an idol concert because, again, every SAO player has an Augma (to the story\u00e2\u0080\u0099s credit, they all got a free Augma for being an SAO survivor. Not to the story\u00e2\u0080\u0099s credit: WHY THE FUCK WOULD SURVIVORS PLAY WITH IT AFTER WHAT THEY WENT THROUGH? \u00e2\u0080\u009cSorry you nearly died playing a video game, have another video game!\u00e2\u0080\u009d) and lives in the immediate vicinity of the story\u00e2\u0080\u0099s action. Suddenly, monsters attack the concert as our villain stands over everything watching people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s memories get ripped from their brains and uploaded, all to recreate his daughter. Because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enough motivation to become a potential mass murderer.\n\nThankfully Kirito saves the day and the police, who were too busy arresting me for watching Eromanga Sensei, finally show up the moment Kirito has saved the world.\n\nYou know...the police could have intervened way earlier...the government could have told everyone to not use Augmas because they will give you brain damage.\n\nBut nah. In fact, the government and police of Japan are so inept, Augma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s are still being used even after it was found out they can steal memories, replace memories, and do pretty much every plot device from Ghost in the Shell (which begs the question, are all the characters actually androids or cyborgs? Do they all have cyberbrains? Because you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t rip memories out of someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biological brain using a device that you take on and off like a headband).\n\nI wish I had one of those Augma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to rip my memories of watching this steaming pile. I feel like I lost IQ points watching Ordinal Scale; and given my anime viewing habits I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have many more to give. This movie continues Sword Art\u00e2\u0080\u0099s streak of good ideas being ruined by the incompetence of a writer who doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to craft a sensible plot grounded in a realistic world. I can forgive the fact that this AR tech would be extremely dangerous to use in real life (getting hit by cars, falling down stairs, all kinds of potential hazards), especially if it changes your perception entirely to that of a fantasy world. I mean, that was my first major question but for the sake of enjoyment I can let it slide.\n\nSword Art Online as a franchise has a problem and this movie exemplifies it: the games are cool and the technology is interesting but the author feels the need to constantly push over-the-top villains and real world drama into a show that would be better as a slice-of-life about an overpowered cardboard cutout and his harem playing a variety of futuristic video games. Mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Rosario continues to be the only shining spot in SAO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history purely because it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have some ridiculous villain and stupid stakes. It was applying the technology to a realistic situation and building characters through slice-of-life drama rather than action drama.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not a baseless SAO hater. I actually like quite a few facets of the series. But I also can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t brainlessly fanboy over something that gives the middle finger to my capacity for thought. The promise at the end of Ordinal Scale that SAO will return is a double-edged sword. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m excited to see the game the author creates next but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m terrified by the stakes he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll attach to it.\n\nOrdinal Scale is a bad movie with high production values and a couple good ideas here and there. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty much on par with the stupidity of every arc that came before (and nowhere near as good as Mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Rosario). The stupid plot, the desperate appeal to emotions at the end, and the weak motivation of the villain leaves the only real reason to watch this the two seconds of Asuna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nipple you see in that one shot where they show her leaving the bathtub. Because they couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cut it when the audience intuits that she is going to leave to do something, you have to physically see her leave the tub. And see her nipple.\n"}, {"id": 4427, "score": 60, "body": "__(Before I start, I implore you to watch the Season 1 specials before starting this season if you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t already.

Characters like Kanako and Saori, who didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get much air-time in the first season, get more time this season, although still not that much.\n\nimg1000(https://i.imgur.com/FwhRWwg.jpg)\n\nThe best thing about Oreimo and one of the main reasons that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so gripping is its characters. The second season tries to develop side characters more,  Side characters that would normally not get much air-time, like Ayase or Saori, each gets an episode dedicated to them. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re both great characters, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s awesome to see them both get their own episode. As good as that is, it does sacrifice from the actual plot, which was more erratic this season. \n\nWhile the first season was a more one-to-one adaption of the light novels it was based on, this season cuts way more source material and is selective in what it adapts. While there are external circumstances for why the studio decided to go this way, I still have to judge this season as it is presented.  The last half of the anime was rushed, even skipping most of a full volume of the light novel. The result is that we end up seeing major plot events sneak up to us, without little preparation or context for why it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening. This is the case especially with Minami, whose childhood arc with Kyousuke was for the most part cut, which in turn makes her less likable in the anime.\n\nimg1000(https://i.imgur.com/9kF8tmB.jpg)\n\nFor a typical anime, this would be an instant turn-off, but for an anime like Oreimo, there is almost a bitter-sweetness to witnessing this. It creates a whole new monster from what it intended to be. It taunts the viewer, hurting its feelings and punishing them for being emotionally invested into certain characters. Its effacement causes the viewers to fill in the gaps for what they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see, and then get upset about it. Oreimo is the only anime that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen do that. I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give points for it, but Oreimo is one of the most memorable anime that I have ever watched, for this reason among others.\n\n__(The good thing for us is that the Light Novel fills in those gaps. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all translated into English, so you can find them and download the PDFs online if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interested.)__\n\nOreimo is a one of a kind anime. I will never forget it as long as I live. Hell, this is my fifth time re-watching it, if that gives you any idea how insanely memorable it is. Does that make it a good anime though? Not really. While making it memorable, the rushed pacing of the second half of this season creates unnecessary drama and makes certain parts forgettable. The first quarter, while having a few good episodes, is totally bland compared to the second half, and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t progress the anime that far.\n\nimg1000(https://i.imgur.com/aQYyDkS.jpg)\n\nEven if it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that good, and the plot of the anime is unapproachable to many (for good reason), I think everyone should watch Oreimo at least once. It is an emotional journey that will leave you empty as a whole, wondering what you are doing with life. It may make you take up smoking cigarettes as a hobby, but I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth it.\n\nAs the late Jim Valvano said, _\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you laugh, you think, and you cry, that's a full day. That's a heck of a day. You do that seven days a week, you're going to have something special.\u00e2\u0080\u009d_ Oreimo will make you do all three. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to explain my affinity for it, especially since I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not into other anime of the same nature. Oreimo has something special about it, it just is in a league of its own. Even if the score I give it is mediocre, and if its contents are disgusting, and if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a rushed product, I would recommend it.\n\nimg1000(https://i.imgur.com/T5lL3FE.jpg)\n\n__(If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking into the meaning of the ending of the anime, I would recommend you to google it. The Oreimo subreddit explains a lot about it and clears things up. Also, read the Light Novels if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re that interested.)__\n"}, {"id": 4430, "score": 57, "body": "Handlung (Quelle: A2Y):\nDunkle Wolken ziehen \u00c3\u00bcber den friedlichen Planeten Neu-Namek, kurz nach dem Sieg von Son-Goku \u00c3\u00bcber Cooler, Freezers Bruder, auf. Ein riesiger Metallplanet, genannt der \u00c2\u00bbGhetti Stern\u00c2\u00ab, \u00c3\u00bcberdeckt den Planeten. Die Namekianer werden von einer hoch entwickelten Roboterarmee gefangen genommen. Son-Goku und seine Freunde machen sich sofort auf den Weg, um Neu-Namek von den Angreifern zu befreien. Dabei trifft Son-Goku v\u00c3\u00b6llig unerwartet auf einen alten Bekannten. Jemanden, den alle f\u00c3\u00bcr Tod gehalten haben. Son-Gokus gr\u00c3\u00b6\u00c3\u009ften Rivalen Cooler. Werden die beiden Super-Sayajins Vegeta und Son-Goku dieser \u00c3\u009cbermacht gewachsen sein?\n\nAblauf 6.5/10:\nPuuhh nach \u00c3\u00bcber ein Jahrzehnt rewatched und ich muss sagen, joa... Der Anfang und die Erkl\u00c3\u00a4rung warum unsere Z-Fighter zum Planeten \"Neu-Namek\" reisen ist mehr runtergequaselt als alles andere. Ich finde es ja gut das man schnell zum Punkt kommen m\u00c3\u00b6chte, aber so lustlos? Der Ablauf ist genau der selbe wie bei Freezer. Alle Namekianer lassen sich gefangen nehmen und ein \"Krieger\" meint aus der Reihe zu tanzen und bekommt One-Hit... wow danke f\u00c3\u00bcr nichts, loser! Der Unterschied: Dieses mal ist es Cooler und der sogenannte \"Ghetti Stern\", der ein hochmoderner Computership ist der eine k\u00c3\u00bcnstliche Intelligenz entwickelt hat und der sich mit all den Weltraumschrott fusioniert hat... samt Cooler. Dende schickt Son Goku, Son Gohan und, wer kann`s erraten? Genau Pi\u00c3\u00a7Colo... um den Planeten zu retten. Dabei sind \u00c3\u00bcbrigens auch Muten Roshi, Yajirobe und Oolong... einfach Oolong... Zu erst k\u00c3\u00a4mpfen sie gegen die Cyclopian Guardian, die am Anfang nat\u00c3\u00bcrlich overpowered dargestellt werden um am Ende durch jeden einzelnen Schlag zerberstet zu werden. Diese nehmen Muten Roshi und die anderen beiden Nulpen direkt mal gefangen. Kuririn und Son Gohan schlagen sich tapfer, aber bekommen am Ende doch auf Maul und werden verschleppt. Pi\u00c3\u00a7Colo k\u00c3\u00a4mpft inzwischen Zeit gegen die restlichen Poser und erledigt alle mit einer aus dem K\u00c3\u00b6rper strahlenden Ki-Explosion. Sei Spruch danach: \"H\u00c3\u00a4tte ich doch nicht so auf dem Putz hauen m\u00c3\u00bcssen!\" oder so \u00c3\u00a4hnlich. Das sagt genau der der 10 Sekunden davor \u00c3\u00bcbel kassiert hat. An der anderen Front kommt Vegeta Son Goku zu Hilfe der \u00c3\u00bcbel gegen Metall Cooler kassiert. Zusammen schaffen sie es mit aller Anstrengung diesen zu besiegen. Und dann kommt er... der PLOTTWIST! Es gibt einen weiteren Cooler... nein eine ganze Arme! Vagina und Karottenkuchen stellen sich ihnen ersch\u00c3\u00b6pft entgegen und wachen im n\u00c3\u00a4chsten Moment in der Schaltzentrale oder eher das Gehirn? des Ghetti Stern's auf und sehe den wahren Cooler. Dieser zapft die beiden Super Saiyajin's ab um mehr Power f\u00c3\u00bcr seinen Stern zu bekommen. Als er merkt es sei zu viel Energie und der Stern kann diese nicht aufnehmen, pumpen die beiden weiteres KI in den Stern um diesen zu \u00c3\u00bcberlasten. Cooler's Antwort darauf: \"Oh nein! Ich wusste nicht das Super Saiyajin's so viel Kraft besitzen!!!11\". Aha. Hat in den Film davor aber \u00c3\u00bcbel gegen EINEN von denen kassiert und jetzt wundert er sich das ZWEI zusammen so viel Kraft besitzen... Da isser wieder euer Schlaukopf! Im letzten entscheidenden Kampf rettet V-V-Vagina erneut den Karottenkuchen und dieser besiegt Cooler mit der kleinsten, schmalsten und l\u00c3\u00a4cherlichsten Kikugel die er noch hervorbringen kann. Diese dringt in seine rechte Brust und l\u00c3\u00a4sst ihn implodieren. Wie viele Namekianer tot sind wurde leider nicht gesagt, Schade :c\n\nAnimation 7/10:\nUffu. Schwer diese heute neutral und ohne Nostalgie zu bewerten. An sich fand ich sie noch sehr stabil bis mittelm\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u009fig. Trotzdem gab es Dinge die mich gest\u00c3\u00b6rt haben. Als erstes sind es diese Lichtreflektionen auf Metall Cooler.. Ich meine wer war der Meinung das sein ne gute Idee gewesen??? Das sieht verdammt schei\u00c3\u009fe aus. Zweitens: Wieso sprintet Cooler IMMER in Zeitlupe? WARUM? Ich meine... klar der hat alle Zeit der Welt, aber anstatt in ber\u00c3\u00bchmter \"Bruder muss los\"-Manier zu laufen (was trotzdem ziemlich cool ist) kann er doch einfach ganz normal im NORMALEN Tempo laufen... Das dritte ist eher random. Denn es gibt eine Szene wo der einzelne Cooler auf Son Goku zu l\u00c3\u00a4uft und auf einmal ist da ein Hitzeflimmern... Einfach so, sonst nirgends. Nur in dieser Szene. Meckern auf h\u00c3\u00b6chsten Niveau. \n\nCharaktere 6/10:\nDas ist der Punkt den ich gerne ausf\u00c3\u00bchrlicher mache, aber hier fast gar nicht zur Sache tut. Hier geht es nur um die Einf\u00c3\u00bchrung eines Movie-Chars. Metall Cooler wird gut dargestellt. Sch\u00c3\u00b6n dominant, abgehoben, aber trotzdem eine k\u00c3\u00bchle \u00c3\u009cberlegenheit. Es ist gut das nochmal seine Vergangenheit mit Goku erz\u00c3\u00a4hlt wird, damit man ein wenig Referenzen hat. Sonst wird nicht viel mit den Charakter gemacht. Man h\u00c3\u00a4tte viel rei\u00c3\u009ferischer mit seiner Rache umgehen k\u00c3\u00b6nnen. F\u00c3\u00bcr mich fehlt da noch mehr der schlechte Ton und der eklige Charakter seiner Rasse die diese so ausmacht. \n\nMusik 1/10:\nHier ist die Rubrik geschlagen. Keine musikalische Untermalungen der Gem\u00c3\u00bcter keine Battlemusik die dich in Stimmung f\u00c3\u00bcr den Fight bringt. Verschwendetes Verbesserungspotenzial. \n\nEnjoyment 8/10:\nTrotz vieler Kritikpunkte die Aufgez\u00c3\u00a4hlt habe, habe ich diesen Film ohne Langeweile geschaut. Es lag hier glaube ich viel mehr am Nostalgiefaktor und an den Movie-Boss den ich bis heute als einer meiner absoluten Favoriten z\u00c3\u00a4hle. Die Handlung war nicht originell, aber wenigstens haben Pi\u00c3\u00a7Colo und ein paar Namekianer auf die Fresse bekommen. Krillin hatte seine gute alte \"Immer muss mir das passieren\"-Szene und Oolong die Sau war einfach nur nutzlos as fuck. Cooler wurde nice dargestellt und wie ich finde zurecht overpowered *fangirling*. Sein \"Bruder muss los\"-Sprint ist eine wahre Legende und war seiner Zeit Jahr voraus. Die Animationen sind auf Grund des Alters des Filmes (1992) ansehnlich und haben nicht genervt. Nur war die musikalische Untermalung einfach, f\u00c3\u00bcr mich pers\u00c3\u00b6nlich, nicht gegeben.. was extrem Schade ist. \n\nMit Sub gesehen? Nein\nMit Dub gesehen?

This is the point of the movie in which my hype died dramatically.\n\nSomehow Okarin is becoming more \"Unstable\" and travelling between the Steins;Gate World-Line and the R one, this is due to the Reading Steiner.\nOkay, hold up, Reading Steiner does not work like that. We **NEVER** were told that Reading Steiner can do that **EVER**. Reading Steiner is an ability that Okarin has to remember the previous world-lines he inhabited, not travel between them.\n\nThere is also the fact that two World-Lines (Steins;Gate and R) are active. This also breaks the rules of the Original Series that were made in the series.\n\nAnd this is pretty much it to the story. Kurisu tries to save Okarin from being forgotten and being trapped in the R world-line. She goes through time, even all the way back to when Okarin was younger. I also disliked the idea that it was Kurisu who told Okarin about a \"MAD SCIENTIST\". It was so much better when Okarin made up that by himself as a way to cheer up Mayushii from her depression since it proves further that Okarin does care deeply about his friends.\n\nThe whole story felt really rushed. They just threw in some random melancholic themes and called it a day just to get the movie out and profit from the name.\nIt's a shame really, I love Steins;Gate, its a sereis to hooked me into Anime. The thought that has went into it was impressive. I still have to play the VNs (Especially 0 since I heard its 1000x better than the Anime).\n\n~~~img420(http://www.animewp.com/wallpaper/2015/11/steins-gate-fuka-ryiki-no-deja-vu-5-background-wallpaper.png)~~~\n<br>\n\n\n[**CHARACTERS:**]()\nThe movie doesn't really bring any new character to the table. I assume you watched the original S;G so you should know how they behave.\n\nThere is a difference though. Kurisu, Okarin, and Suzuha.\n\nKurisu, being the main character, falls desperate trying to save Okarin. She goes from her Tsundere self to more of a Chuuni like Okarin.\n\nOkarin, he's just done. Not even a single care in the world. He wanted to save Kurisu and Mayushii so he doesn't care if he gets in to some trouble. He's kind of similar to the S;G 0 version of Okarin but just more lazy.\n\nSuzuha, she is a confusing case. Normally she only appears in the past when World War 3 is about to happen due to the Time Machine, but somehow she still is here despite the fact that this is the Steins;Gate World-Line. The explanation given in the movie...doesn't really make sense. Kurisu builds a time machine to help Okarin but then seals it off due to the reason \"This is what Okarin wanted\". Then Suzuha uses it.\n~~~img420(https://pa1.narvii.com/6913/50a190e6c3ad7735e6eeb42dbb8ec104b70808far1-640-356_hq.gif)~~~\n<br>\n\n\n[**ART/ANIMATION:**]()\nThe animation style and the art didn't change that much, the movements do seem a lot more fluid.\nThe movies still has the same colour scheme, same atmosphere. So its all good here!\n~~~img420(https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/960856720983537541/3C59E806AAEEF97E0047FA4E73B68FAA8B9F3CB5/)~~~\n<br>\n\n\n[**MUSIC:**]()\nAs much as I don't like this movie, the OST was quite good.\nWell this is to be expected from Steins;Gate. The OP (Sung by our lovely Kanako Ito) is amazing, she is always able to pull off any OP very well.\nThe ED on the other hand, not something I would listen to daily but considering the theme of the movie it fits.\n~~~img420(https://media0.giphy.com/media/VBc6l3CqQonqo/giphy.gif)~~~\n##### ~~~Couldn't find the OP gif so here have this one~~~\n<br>\n\n\n[**OVERALL OPINION:**]()\nI hate to say this but this movie really is an insult to the series. It is clear to see they didn't really try to come up with a story.\nThey threw some some stuff together, slapped the Steins;Gate logo and characters on it and called it a day.\n\nIt breaks the things we learned in the S;G and S;G 0 (This even released later than the movie), the story is all wonky and confusing and doesn't even wrap up well, it just kinda moves forward not really taking its time to explain its self.\n\nIn my opinion this is more of a spin off. A poor Spin Off. "}, {"id": 4433, "score": 61, "body": "\u00e2\u0080\u009cDate A Live\u00e2\u0080\u009d never stops in told its story of Shido Itsuka as the most fortunate man even though he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as lucky as other MCs. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the contamination series it lives on until today. After a long-awaited after the aftermath in the first season, this second season continues into visual novel dating sim-like into a gimmick; as the dating is an emphasize to save the world. This sequel feels more like a rushed series than the first season where Koushi Tachibana and Production IMS worked on just 10 episodes. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s different from the first season or the type of anime in general where they always work on one cour show. Because of that, this sequel is quite different, apart from I kind of enjoy what was shown.\n\nStill, the story focuses on Shidou our savior of the world without a robe. While the first season tells about Shidou\u00e2\u0080\u0099s struggle in conquering four spirits, this season focuses on the spirits of the Yamai twins and Miku Izayoi. But, the show is a little bit slippery and stiff. Like a harem show, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect much but it looks like the first episode makes me uncomfortable. But, why did I continue? Because I have to finish what I just start. Introducing, Tohka as the underlooked lead girl. In fact, the show didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t explain much except that she was the lead heroine. Then, Origami as the overcoming stalker to Shidou. But, I kind of notice something that Shidou really enjoyed. He really enjoyed everything as in the first season, he looked uncomfortable. Maybe because he had found Yoshino, Kotori, and Kurumi but they lived like family; except Kurumi.\n\nTohka is different in the first season but in this season, she is more confident, innocent, and honest. Similar to the second series, it is inseparable from the various cultures. On the other hand, there is Origami who doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be outdone by Tohka herself. The love war begins as in the harem war more precisely. In addition, this season sticks with its old format, which is a choice.\n\nShidou must go through various choices in order to conquer the spirits. Strategy and direction are the main keys but the show has something that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lacking with feeling. Like Shidou, like it or not, you have to pretend himself so that the spirits, or the girls, can be conquered. Therefore, all of the girls seem to react to Shidou instead of hunting for more spirits. That means there will be more kisses than I expected. Dating is no longer the main key, but a harem show I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really expect so much.\n\nThe pacing is very fast and different from the first season where you see new heroines. This season, because it has fast pacing, the execution is very bad. The Yamai twins besides the two of them are the stage of all of which are just memorable through a cameo. The show focuses more on the encore itself, which is the chemistry between Shidou and Miku. I kind of forgot how Tohka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s alter ego had been told and a few roles for Kurumi but just like things, nothing but poses personalities. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forget with the classic beach episode. I preferred the first season where Shidou slowly got what he had achieved. While this second season focuses on those who already exist.\n\nI like Shidou more this season than at the beginning of the series. He is now more aware of what his mission really was, what he was there for, and what his purpose. He is courageous in conquering all these spirits by playing his character to pretend to be someone else. The spirits also deserve to be blessed saved by Shidou because they have something more than just being saved. All of them are unique and one thing is certain as well, they deserved to be together.\n\nThe chemistry between Kurumi and Shidou is actually the most interesting part. Kurumi is the most unique spirit of all and the fans were adore her. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, but she seems like an antagonist or anti-hero maybe. But, she deserved more than just the OVA. And by the way, the OVA is one of the beautiful things I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen compared to other sub-plot characters.\n\nWhile the action takes the same format as in the first season, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say that the two are the same. Shidou, like himself, acts as nothing but worse in this season. In fact, almost all spirits cannot fight Miku at the end of the arc except Kurumi who even has a small role. Origami herself couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do anything and Shidou could only whine and try desperately as much as possible. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just focusing on the fan service just because screw action, here we come fan service. The artwork, despite the studio change where it was AIC Plus+ previously, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change anything and I liked it. The new spirits, the Yamai twins and Miku, have some unique and distinctive design. The background feels more natural even the beach episode seems as well. The traditional panties, swimsuits, and other things you could come with fan service.\n\nThe soundtrack is the same as the first season but Miku\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice sounds like a bit of annoying. Not that Minori Chihara is a bad voice actress regardless she was good in \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\u00e2\u0080\u009d as Yuki. While that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all, the soundtrack is fit with the scene whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s action or drama. The opening and ending theme songs have a remarkable feel because of it. The second season has a bit of disappointment from lack of characterization and story but in fact, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of those series which live on and on. We are not given much about spirits and only 10 episodes fill two arcs. Despite giving something new, the contrasting between the main character and new spirits were so-called blurry. For an average show, I still like this series and forever might be."}, {"id": 4440, "score": 67, "body": "~~~img400(https://imgur.com/h2gSWlo.jpg)\n~~~\nIn an era of the mundane, where every series is the same moe blob, the weird sticks out. Even the most mediocre series can get attention just by being weird. _Paranoia Agent_ is not mediocre, and it is far beyond simply \"weird\". Written and Directed by Satoshi Kon, _Paranoia Agent_ is one of his last works before his untimely death. With only _Paprika_ and _Good Morning_ coming after it. Known for a radical style and a penchant for the odd, Satoshi Kon was an extraordinary director, unique to any other. _Paranoia Agent_ lives up to this reputation, being unlike any other series I have ever seen. Its horror is Lovecraftian, its style chilling though as interesting as it is, this isn't always in it's favor. For the most part, the series is a joy, but when you try something new, it doesn't all stick.\n\nWelcome to _Paranoia Agent_, one of the hardest reviews I have ever written. I am still not quite happy with it, but let's jump in!\n\n__Quick Warning: This review contains spoilers for _Paranoia Agent_! If you have not seen the full series, turn back now. You can find individual episode write ups on my home blog [here](http://psgels.net/category/finished-series/paranoia-agent/)__\n\n~~~img(https://imgur.com/9b5vuK5.jpg)~~~\n\n# ~~~__Art/Animation__~~~\n\nStarting off, let's talk production. _Paranoia Agent_ is incredibly inconsistent on this front. Sometimes you will get an episode with fantastic, fluid animation in Kon's style. Very fluid faces and muscles, where the cheeks, tongue and chin all move and the skin stretches as they do. It's a style I love, and it looks fantastic when it's shown. There are also the occasional experimental animation, where they go off the book and do something... weird. However other times there is barely any movement at all. Lots of stills, pans and zooms. The direction, which we will get to soon, usually makes these visually interesting. But when talking animation, a still is a still. On their own, for its age, this wouldn't be a big deal. It's only in comparison to the high's that these start to disappoint.\n\nAs far as Art Style goes, I mentioned it a bit just now, but Kon has a very distinctive style. You could recognize it purely based on his characters faces in any of his works. If I had to pick out why, it would probably be the mouth, and the focus he puts on it. The shadows of the lower lip, the cheekbones and jaw. It's all very distinctive, and since I watch Tokyo Godfathers almost yearly at this point, I find it easy to identify. Outside the characters however _Paranoia Agent_ is very... not generic, but metropolitan. It most likely used a lot of actual streets, buildings and angels as references for its backgrounds. It's all generally rather bland. This only changes when _Paranoia Agent_ goes off the rails, completely inventing its own environments, where the style changes completely. These are always a treat, standing out in the episode.\n\n~~~img(https://imgur.com/4f0Ltzd.jpg)~~~\n\n# ~~~__Direction__~~~\n\nPersonally, I find _Paranoia Agent's_ direction to be much stronger and augments its animation well. Kon goes for a lot of interesting or informative angles. Telling the viewer how to feel based on these angles. One might call this, \"good film making\". For instance, take the screenshot above. The downward angle and direction of the eyes conveys a very oppressive atmosphere. Making it appear these balloons are watching you, marking your every move. These kinds of tricks are found throughout _Paranoia Agent_. Informing the viewer how to feel about scenes long before any dialogue. It manages to make what would otherwise be a dull, still shot, captivating, at least until it needs to change scenes. All in all, I found the Direction and Cinematography to be the most interesting part of _Paranoia Agent's_ production, as it has a distinctly Kon flavor.\n\n~~~img(https://imgur.com/OFamb0l.jpg)~~~\n\n# ~~~__Story/Setting__~~~\n\nNow though, let's get into perhaps _Paranoia Agent's_ most ambitious segment, its Story and Setting. The setting is, for the most part, just Tokyo. A large, metropolitan city with plenty of conveniences and people. The story though is... its weird. It is simultaneously the best Eldritch Horror, most inane mystery and expert social commentary I have ever seen. It starts off telling a singular story, slowly splitting off to multiple characters that tie into the lead story. Then it splits of completely separately, before somehow wrapping it all up in a single episode, retroactively granting context to many of the more questionable episodes. Even now, I have yet to decide whether or not that was intended, or if its complete bullshit. But what I can say is this: I have never been more confused, yet wholly satisfied, than when _Paranoia Agent's_ credits roll.\n\nFor the actual story content itself, and why I was satisfied, I felt Kon presented it well. Each of _Paranoia Agent's_ characters hits on another aspect of society, effectively taking pot-shots on it. Whether it be gossiping moms, machismo in Japanese society, the stress of a workaholic culture or the power of rumors, Kon hits it all. All the while using it to build a greater narrative about accepting one's own mistakes, the suddenness of life, and moving on. Using Shounen Bat to turn all of our characters into victims, so their problems are no longer their fault. The only major issue I have with _Paranoia Agent_ is the effective filler episodes. After the fact, they fit a little better. But in the moment, they don't really fit the narrative leading up to that point. They feel out of place, and really drain away the stories momentum.\n\n~~~img(https://imgur.com/YrbQTah.jpg)~~~\n\n# ~~~__Characters__~~~\n\nSpeaking of the characters, _Paranoia Agent_ is rather hit or miss here. In the first half, many of them are well established. They get entire episodes dedicated to them. Only connecting them to the greater story as a whole by the end. Each of them then return in future episodes, to sort of check in on where they are. To make it known that their stories are still ongoing. However, in the latter half its almost as if _Paranoia Agent_ wasn't meant to be 13 episodes long. As there are 2 episodes worth of characters that aren't really relevant to the overall story. Such as the ghosts, who exist almost solely to comment on society's treatment of children or Homosexuals. I think these stories are worth appearing the _Paranoia Agent_, but not in this very fillery way.\n\n~~~img(https://imgur.com/l0IE0Fc.jpg)~~~\n\n# ~~~__Weirdness\u00c2\u00a0__~~~\n\nFinally, I want to talk about the sheer... weirdness, of _Paranoia Agent_, as this is where it excels. More than any other series, _Paranoia Agent_ is unique. Unlike anime I have ever watched before. Its story is cyclical, without being a complete loop. Pushing the nature of the world as one that inevitably repeats, what its events have happened even before now. That humanity needs a continuous reminder as to its own screw-ups. Yet, it doesn't feel cheap or unearned. It progresses each character through the story such that their ending fills the hole left by another. On top of that, it also doesn't pop this out of nowhere. _Paranoia Agent_ has suffused Eldritch Horror into its story from the very beginning. With an unknowable, unstoppable, inhuman monster beyond human comprehension. Basically, _Paranoia Agent_ is the closest thing to a Lovecraftian anime I have ever seen.\n\nThe only other place I have seen this from Japan come from Junji Ito. With his works such as \"Spiral\" and \"The Enigma of Amigara Fault\". It's something that, even if it can't happen, resonates with the very core of what it means to be human. Junji Ito does that with the unknown, and human curiosity. Our inability to stop ourselves when confronted with terrible knowledge. _Paranoia Agent_ does it here with our refusal to accept reality, to fool ourselves into believing our own lies. Creating gods and monsters where there are none, and having them strike at us just so our faults can be blamed on them. If nothing else, I think this makes _Paranoia Agent_ worth the watch.\n\n~~~img(https://imgur.com/Cm0Xkci.jpg)~~~\n\n# ~~~__Conclusion__~~~\n\nSo, all in all, how was _Paranoia Agent_? In my mind, it is a flawed masterpiece. A one of a kind series that, for all its faults, is wholly unique in anime. Is it objectively the best thing ever because of this uniqueness? No, it has plenty of flaws and for those who aren't into Lovecraftian Horror, I imagine it would be very boring. But for those like me, who love that kind of stuff, the flaws are easily looked past for the themes and style of the series. Yet even then, as much as I love Kon, I can't just waive away its problems. The series drags heavily in the middle, the production varies greatly and it just feels stretched thin for a 13 episode run. I feel that, had Kon made this a movie like his other works, it would have been better served.\n\nBut hey, it's not his fault. Shounen Bat probably wrecked his production team is all."}, {"id": 4444, "score": 50, "body": "Algo que sempre me incomodou dentro da franquia Gundam, s\u00c3\u00a3o seus constantes filmes que recontam as s\u00c3\u00a9ries de TV.

Truly, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely a unique anime to come at first. It uses the concept of a dating-like simulator as its main concept and blends it into a \u00e2\u0080\u009csave the world\u00e2\u0080\u009d theme. The main character has to deal with all kinds of heroines, risk what they are, develop strategies to be able to conquer them, and romance (and a harem of course). But instead have to go on from season one to two, why do we worry with this movie? What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the point instead of separating this movie from season two? Do directors and writers have other choices in drawing back the attention of this movie? What if using the same format that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not much different from the main series? Well, here it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cDate A Live The Movie: Mayuri Judgment\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nDate, a simple word, especially singles hate this word. But, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that the world itself has only one meaning. This simple thing can be a center of attention from the main concept of this series. But, it becomes worse. In a duration of approximately one hour, Shidou must go on six dates from each heroine he has conquered within 40 minutes. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a memorable movie or even a movie anime in general. The movie doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand as a movie in general.\n\nThere is nothing special but I could say, the plot takes you constantly so you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand up to it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about dating and coming, talking, but suddenly, what is that? What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s there? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bird, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a plane, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Mayuri. Now, who is Mayuri? I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know! Her character has never been touched upon from the start and her presence immediately shown up during the climax battle. No explanation, but I hope this character should be presented again in the next season to see her fate must end like that. It seems it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\n\nRegardless of not much that can be talked about on her own character, there was nothing else matters. Apparently, there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any development in this movie either Shidou himself or even Mayuri. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even know why Mayuri is a matter. The relationship between the main character and the rest of all heroines are just the same as the previous series. The characters are everything in this show. They are very interesting especially the chemistry between Shidou and all heroines. While the first and second season tells them one by one, this movie doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really change anything; except Miku for the after-story. Mayuri isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really the point while indeed this movie focuses on herself. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a hint that acts like a stalker following Shidou everywhere and after Shidou realizes it, be a plausible and weak plot.\n\nThe sound and art still are the best, especially this is also a theatrical movie. Production IMS still keeps some high quality, especially the voice acting. Sora Amamiya is pretty good by the way as Mayuri but isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t given enough roles as the lead character of this film. The 3D graphics are out of the box and it seems like they seem to be trying something new. However, their execution failed so that it just seems odd. The background, nothing special. Just Production IMS still stick with its distinctive style.\n\nActually, there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much we can be discussed in this series apart, this is a stand out from season two. Why do they have to separate them? Whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a problem, no matter this movie seems to stick with its unique concept but still used generic format. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMayuri Judgment\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a pretty disappointing average movie if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still related to the series. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really push anything from its character but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still one that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s failed. Not that bad as well. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fine movie from its prequel."}, {"id": 4467, "score": 59, "body": "*spoilers for Code Geass R2 and Geass Movie 3, and minor spoilers for this movie*\n\nAnd there I was, terrified. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no way this could work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said knowing of Zero\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past oversights and inability to come up with decent contingencies and rewrites. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve witnessed imbeciles foolishly latch themselves onto his name and provide nothing of value, unless you count unnecessary complications as valuable. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen him redo ideas to mixed results, and tamper with the inexplicable. As the moment of truth came, I cast my fears aside and prayed for a miracle, as a fellow Black Knight. \n\nSomehow, we made it, if not in one piece. Zero is the miracle worker, after all.\n\nRevival sequels are a strange gamble. Often without the vision of the original team, these titles are put up against nostalgia. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re confined by the rules and possible mistakes of their predecessors, as well as the expectations of those who cling to them. When looking at the likes of Diebuster or FLCL Progressive for example, I see nothing but mockeries of their predecessors and misunderstandings of what made them popular to begin with. Even the better examples I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen such as the 2018 Halloween sequel and Star Wars: The Force Awakens are still decent at best, therefore still incapable of stacking up to their predecessors. When you consider the legacy of Code Geass, how monumental the series finale was, and how messy its second season was, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to see this film justifying its own existence, let alone living up to either season. While this film never entirely succeeds at either, the fact that it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fail miserably is a miracle in itself. \n\nThere are a few aspects of the film\u00e2\u0080\u0099s narrative that I must praise. For one, they finally tried explaining C\u00e2\u0080\u0099s world instead of leaving it as a convoluted nonentity connected to a bunch of disparate, inexplicable aspects of Geass such as the Thought Elevator and how most of the new Geass powers are tied to the insecurities of the characters that wield them. It makes just enough sense for me to not question everything about it. The way they use this to justify Lelouch not being dead mostly adds up when you consider what happened in R2. The revival aspect was the main thing this movie needed to justify, and it did so while fleshing out something that both demanded scrutiny and damaged Geass R2 so heavily. \n\nThe subsequent reunion scenes were generally solid, touching on the baggage most of the characters had with Lelouch in ways perfectly befitting most of these characters, even if the way they handled the major reunion and Lelouch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character in the first leg of the film was questionable. Despite that and how the characters tend to stand around and talk instead of shoot, the film\u00e2\u0080\u0099s narrative is relatively functional. Most of the film\u00e2\u0080\u0099s setpieces work well, and every scene that touches on the former student council and most of the characters not heavily involved in the plot was handled in sweet and satisfying ways. It has a surprisingly decent final climax, and an incredibly interesting mental and supernatural chess match between Lelouch and the film\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gorgeous main antagonist, Princess Shamna. On the surface, the film\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plot is serviceable.\n\nThat said, it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be a Geass narrative if it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a mess, and it all revolves around the antagonists and their nation. The kingdom of Zilkhstan apparently suffered as a result of the Zero Requiem, which was meant to help restore peace and unify the world. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a war-torn country who was so powerful they once took down a Britannian army twice its size, and the pair of main antagonists, Shanma and Shalio, want to restore it to its former glory using C\u00e2\u0080\u0099s world. There are three major problems that destroy this entire thing. First off, where were they during the main series? They didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even try to justify the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lack of involvement given their supposed strength and how their specific powers would have thrown everything out of whack for all warring nations in the original series. Given that they fought Britannia once, why did they stop, and when did they fight? Perhaps answering all of this would have been too difficult, and I currently can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come up with a good one myself, so this seems like a lose-lose situation. \n\nProblem number two: the fact that the kingdom became war-torn following the Zero Requiem defeats the purpose behind the plan. Sure, this follows the film trilogy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continuity, where the plan was only a step in the right direction towards world peace instead of an automatic win for world peace, but there shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be any signs of war. In fact, barring the fact that the kingdom started the conflict in the first place, there aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see anything resembling a war-torn, broken country. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s literally just a third-world country. Where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the chaos? Where are the casualties? Where is anything resembling compelling evidence that this kingdom was brought to ruin post-Zero Requiem? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the sole reason behind the villains\u00e2\u0080\u0099 motivations and we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see any of it, making us believe that these characters are just power hungry instead of the desperate souls they are. More on why these characters don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work later, but keep in mind that this is one of the two main reasons the antagonists are less than the sum of their parts, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the final reason the kingdom of Zilkhstan doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work.\n\nTo go back to the film\u00e2\u0080\u0099s positives, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s look at some of the characters. Lelouch himself, barring the questionable state he was in the beginning, is as charismatic a Char clone as ever. He carries this film, both in terms of personality, and in terms of how they deal with his errors and lasting impacts. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taken to task for the emotional turmoil he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s caused, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re reminded that underneath the mask of a magnificent bastard, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a tortured, petty soul whose ability to handle being forced to rethink his plans is still lacking. Surprisingly, in spite of having no new character arc to follow up his long, arduous, series-spanning character arc, Suzaku stands out as likable, and even consistent. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the hypocritical douche he once was, but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s every bit as emotional, and his hang-ups regarding Lelouch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s return are some of the most believable in the film given his character. \n\nSadly, it goes downhill from there for a variety of reasons. Simply put, barring the return of the hilarious, sassy and borderline sociopathic scientist, Lloyd Asplund, the series seems to have run out of charisma for its characters. This is most noticeable with C.C and Jerimiah Gottwald. The former was a sassy, sarcastic, snarky vixen whose banter with Lelouch and his allies made for some of the funniest moments of the show. The latter was a monumental ball of ham across both seasons. Both characters are robbed of these traits, and even though C.C is now more important than ever before, her attachment to Lelouch and the insecurities she would often guard are given infinitely more focus than anything else about her. Sure, some of the banter and antics of the characters kept entirely intact are some of the most charming and entertaining parts of the film, but it feels like they have a hard time writing the personalities of most of the other characters without at least a little bit of strange deviation. Most of the reunion scenes were still great, but a lot of the returning characters that are remotely active in the main plot don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel quite right. If nothing else, the student council and scientist characters from the show were kept intact.\n\nThe new characters are easily the worst ones in the film. The secondary antagonists are incredibly one-note and leave little in the way of charisma despite how much screen time they take up. The main antagonists, Shamna and Shalio, are their own anomaly. The film tries to make us sympathize with them and see them as broken, desperate individuals rather than bland, badly-written characters, but this fails for two reasons. Firstly, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually see their kingdom in a horrible, war-torn state. They just tell us that it is and that this drove them to take drastic measures. As a result, we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel for them and how much they claim their people have suffered for them. The second reason they fail is that half of the time, Shamna and Shalio are simply portrayed as a generic, power-hungry ruler without morals, and an angry, bloodthirsty psychopath and cult lunatic. Those portrayals are at odds with one another. As a result, these villains feel like half-baked characters that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t truly commit to being either kind of antagonist. Even if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not the worst main antagonists this franchise has, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re honestly less than the sum of their parts. \n\nThe surreal, mixed bag quality doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop at the writing, as it impacts the visuals as well. I have one question to start with: why didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they use the updated art style of the remake trilogy? That art style was a perfect recapturing of the original, as it provided more detail and polish than ever before. The new style isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bad, but it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as good as what was given to us this past year. To be fair, most people likely wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t notice, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a functional update of the original art style. Still, if they were gonna make it less detailed than in the trilogy, they could have allowed the characters to move more. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not badly animated or distractingly limited like in most of the Akito films, but even the original TV shows had more 2D animation than this. That doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean the artwork isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pretty, even though it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surprisingly inconsistent. However, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s partially put to waste when the new character designs are a total mixed bag. Some of the redesigns look stellar, but barring Shamna, the new character designs look anywhere from mediocre to just awkward and practically overdesigned. \n\nAnother major problem is the CGI, as the sort of Gamecube cel-shaded CG machines look and feel borderline uncanny at the best of times, and horrendous at the worst of times. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even more of it than in R2. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all the more baffling is that the Akito films actually got this right with the later films, making the mechs look metallic. Why didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they opt for that look? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like the mechs have that much movement anyway compared to the TV series. Hell, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only one breakdancing mecha action sequence in the film. Speaking of mechs, the new designs are god awful. The clunky, Mobile Armor-esque armors surrounding the iconic Lancelot and Guren units are just ugly, CGI or no. The antagonists\u00e2\u0080\u0099 mechs look ridiculous as well, and one of them is a scorpion mech, which damages the design philosophy of the franchise\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mechs in a way not seen since the spider and horse mechs of Akito back in the first half of this decade. The CGI doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop there as they decided to make C\u00e2\u0080\u0099s world CGI for most of its scenes, and that was a terrible idea. The production is overall subpar for a film release, and while not the worst the series offers in the visual department, is still not even on the level of the first season back in 2006.\n\nThe audio presentation is also a disappointment. Kotaro Nakagawa actually managed to disappoint me with the film\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new compositions, as not a single one of them stands out. None of it is bad, in fact, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re serviceable. However, given how bombastic and magnificent the OSTs of both seasons of the original were, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a massive step down. It makes me glad they decided to reuse some of the original series\u00e2\u0080\u0099 tracks, as they were the most noteworthy pieces in the film. In fact, I wish they used more of them. As for the opening and ending credits tracks, they are also decent tracks, even if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not ones I would go out of my way to listen to. I also feel that the dub is weaker than it should have been. Most of the returning female voice actors sound off when you compare their performances here to the TV show. C.C is the most obvious example I can point to. Most of the actors voicing the new characters give subpar performances, with the only exception being Elizabeth Maxwell as Princess Shanma. As for the returning male characters, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also a mixed bag. Lloyd, Lelouch, and Suzaku are voiced just as well as they were originally, but the other male characters range from decent to mediocre. Even Crispin Freeman feels underutilized in his reprised role as Jeremiah Gottwald, as his scenes are limited, and he never really gets the chance to go full ham. No one does, in fact, not even Lelouch, who still shines in spite of that. Frankly, it feels like a lot of the returning cast were out of practice and the new actors weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t up to snuff. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the modern dubbing industry for you.\n\nI feel like I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m being harder on this film than I intend to be. In spite of the film\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glaring problems on the writing and audiovisual aspects, and how disappointing certain hallmark aspects of this franchise were here, I had a good time watching this film. I appreciate how they handled the return of one of the most iconic anime characters of all time and how the other characters interacted with him. I loved seeing the character interactions, including some of the interactions of the antagonists. I reveled in Lelouch dawning the mask of Zero and coming up with insane, 4D chess match plans once again. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m amazed they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t entirely fuck up the supernatural elements which seemed impossible to make function. I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t dissatisfied with what I got, even if the writing had glaring issues to fix and the audiovisual presentation wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t up to the series\u00e2\u0080\u0099 standards. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not even the first time this franchise failed to meet those particular standards thanks to the Akito films. Above all else, this film had to justify its own existence without destroying the monumental ending of R2. Given that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s set in the continuity of the film trilogy, that makes this task easier than it could have been. The fact that it worked at all is a miracle in and of itself, even if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still a little wary of the inevitable installments that this film sets up. All things considered, this was a decent way to revive the series, and that makes me happy."}, {"id": 4476, "score": 68, "body": "Handlung:\nEine Vorgeschichte zu Tokyo Ghoul in der erz\u00c3\u00a4hlt wird wie sich Shuu und Chie trafen.\n\nStory 5.5/10:\nHier wird erz\u00c3\u00a4hlt wann und wo sich Shuu und Chie (___wer auch immer das sein soll___) sich getroffen haben.

As a matter of fact, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth a watch overall, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking into it. But long story short, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely not for everyone, and it honestly wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really for me. That said, I can appreciate it for what it is, and I can appreciate various aspects of it. The show is respectable in its own right\n\n#Overview# \n\nDomestic Girlfriend is a show about a young man named Natsuo, falling in love with his teacher, Hina-sensei. He goes to a mixer with his friends in order to try to take his mind off of his feelings for her, and meets a girl named Rui. She takes him home and asks him to have sex with her, and they do, but Rui wants nothing to do with him afterwards, and Natsuo just feels worse than he did beforehand. After returning home, he learns his dad is remarrying, and happens to be remarrying the mother of both Hina and Rui\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 who are now his relatives.\n\nNow, honestly\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 This premise turned me off at first. However, for what it was, I think it was handled quite well. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not particularly unique or outstanding in any department, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more believable and the situation presented is moderately more tolerable than most other shows with a similar premise. While I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think this did anything to better my opinion of the premise of incest (or\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 pre-incest? I guess? I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know\u00e2\u0080\u00a6), said premise didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do anything to particularly diminish the quality of or the interest of the show. If them being related wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a factor at all, the show wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change all that much. Their being related becomes kind of meaningless (at least, narratively) after a certain point\n\n#The Review# \n\nThe show opens with a scene giving us the aftermath of Rui and Natsuo getting it on. Natsuo lying there, looking fairly dejected, and Rui seeming to not care about what just transpired in any real way. After that, we are greeted with this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opening.\n\nI can sit here all day and criticize the poor visuals of the opening. Is it absolutely devoid of all meaning? Not at all. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got a few symbolic references, and it sets up a much more interesting character dynamic than what is actually explored in the show, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly why I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not a fan of the animation itself; It isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t particularly representative of the show itself. However, the song\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Holy shit, the song is fantastic. The artist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name \u00e2\u0080\u009cMinami\u00e2\u0080\u009d is one I have never heard prior to this opening, but it is one that this song made me wish I had. The passion in the singing is enough to make me feel something, and the OP managed to get more emotion out of me than the rest of the show did, honestly. So on that front, this show is killing it.\n\nNow, moving back to the show itself, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to go over how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s paced. The show moves at a fairly constant rate forward. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see any problem that took me out of the show, or made me think \u00e2\u0080\u009cCould you hurry up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d so to me, the pacing isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a big issue. However, the actual writing lacked for me, especially in regards to the side cast. The show seemed to move characters in and out of the show kind of meaninglessly. Momo, for example, becomes pointless after her short spurt as a character. She doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do anything in particular for Natsuo, either\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 or Rui. Wait, what was Momo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s purpose, again? As for the other characters, they all fade in and out of obscurity every now and again. Sometimes serving superficial purposes, such as exposition or obvious learning moment that is obvious\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t become interchangeable, which is a plus in my book considering the genre the show sits in.\n\nSpeaking of genre, this show is meant to be a romantic drama that is character driven\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But I think it would have worked better as a romantic comedy at least, although I think it having been a Slice of Life would have worked the most. The best scenes in the show are the ones played for laughs. Character dynamics excel in these scenes, and they really highlight what the show could have been had it been more focused on building the web of relationships between the entire cast and hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been so focused on just the main three. The best and most memorable parts of the show are the parts where Natsuo, Rui, and the rest of the cast are casually interacting with one another, whether it be looking for advice and ending up participating in a skit, or bickering over who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s older. The show and its fairly trope-heavy characters work better when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re given time to bounce off of one another. Which is disappointing, considering how great they can be at their best, and how starkly that contrasts with how they are at their worst. The drama does not feel real to me. While it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not exactly so hyperbolic as to be devoid of all emotional impact for me, it never struck me particularly hard\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Especially with Hina.\n\nThe story and plot of this show is what I like to call \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust okay.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It never got me truly invested enough in the characters to look past what I saw as extremely mediocre drama. I also don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think the premise alone is interesting enough to carry that weight. However, it managed to keep my interest through what I described in the previous paragraph; the great scenes with the characters just living life and doing their thing. Every time the show started to get serious, I started to lose interest, and then these funny moments happen and make up for it. The only serious scene that is memorable to me is hilarious because of the way it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s played out. Without spoiling too much, basically Natsuo is put in an extremely uncomfortable position, and when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s peaked, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drawn like a six year old\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cartoon drawing of himself. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fan-fucking-tastic, and when you see it, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll probably at least chuckle at it too.\n\nThe side plot of Natsuo wanting to become an author is also a better story than the actual narrative we are immediately presented with in the show. That character growth and development wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be possible without the garbage that is the main story, but it is infinitely times more satisfying to me. The characters involved in this side plot make up the majority of the cast I find bearable, and they may only be bearable because of their involvement in this side-story. Either way, if this plot we are given was the main plot as opposed to one happening alongside the main story, the show would have been better off, too.\n\nThe cinematography of the show is fairly standard for this kind of show. Some shots really stand out, but most of them are relatively bland. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forgivable and there are no shots in particular that made me feel like it was worth adding or subtracting any kind of rating from this particular side of things. The soundtrack is also the same way, very generic and standard. The soundtrack also works a lot better when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not very serious. The dramatic, generic piano music doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t add to the scenes its in, it just makes me roll my eyes, and adds to the more-forced feeling the drama in this show provides to me. The acting is well done, but the general quality of acting in anime has, at least to me, appeared to be increasing over the last two or so years. As far as modern anime goes, this is one of the higher up ones, but isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deserving of any more particular praise than it being slightly above average.\n\nThe art is somewhat inconsistent but I would say overall it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty good. The background scenes are really, really well done a vast majority of the time, as well. The animation quality itself is just as inconsistent as the quality of the art in general. Sometimes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really good. Nothing standout, but good. Other times, it dips fairly drastically. Sometimes it does this for comedic effect, and it works out, but sometimes it does it when it shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t and it takes me out of the show a little bit. Other than that, not too much to complain about in this department.\n\n#Final thoughts#\n\nDomestic Girlfriend has a lot of good going for it. The comedic, personal scenes are great, the acting is good, the art isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t half bad\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But for all the good it has, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also something negative to be said.\n\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a person who is into romantic dramas and aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t too, too picky about how realistic the drama feels, or are someone who can get attached to characters relatively quickly, I would honestly recommend this show. You will find more enjoyment in this show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drama and seriousness than I did. But if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re someone who expects a lot more out of drama, or needs more time to get to know a character to really care about them, this show may just feel like a lot of wasted potential, like it did for me.\n\nOverall, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say this show is bad by any means. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty good. But that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about it, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just good. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all I can really say about it. So, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the final verdict;\n\n#Domestic Girlfriend: 6/10 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Average#\n\nWhat did you think of the show? Did you think it was better than I did? Or worse, maybe?

This is one of the series that still lasts until now with a gap period of 4 years since the movie. All we need from this series is the fantasies of the fans. Nothing else but this is also the worst one if you are happy to say it. When the first episode aired, this third season gets a not-really-good response. They say that this anime is nothing more than a hentai anime even hentai has so much quality than this. They said that it followed up from the illustration of the difference between the light novel and the series. And also if this allows them to be sad again with this third season.\n\nWith no crap at all, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDate A Live III\u00e2\u0080\u009d is indeed a curious case since the first glance at the second season. This show doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to be asked anymore because of such its simple premise. Although I myself am not too overpraised this anime is as proud as it is. I always say I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll watch anything and since then, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve arrived at this time. J.C.Staff made a lot of \u00e2\u0080\u009cimprovement\u00e2\u0080\u009d in this high-quality series. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like comparing diarrhea that comes in your ears than watching this series. However, I was so curious because, in reality, people were more concerned with quality than stories. This might also apply to video games. But, this third season is still one of your generic standard harems, to begin with. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s such a thing to combine harem with visual dating elements-like.\n\nOur story begins with our savior, Shido Itsuka, who lives happily along with the Spirits he has kissed. This season introduces Natsumi as the seventh spirit. She has two personalities at least or two forms. In addition, Origami introduced the second arc as one of the best arcs in this season. The arc also discusses Origami\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past, decent time travel story, and a rollercoaster allows this arc to be the most serious.\n\nThe first arc introducing Natsumi who played a mind game against Shido and her friends. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the matter? I feel like this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t too important besides Natsumi being the character who has gained the most attention since its PV. But why? This arc is pointless. She takes so much pride and jealous of Shido. Apart from that, I can conclude this arc as not the worse but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just pointless to see this pointless psychological game which is not discussed again in the next arc. Onto the next.\n\nNow, I assume Origami is just a character without any development at all other than being just a slave-love to Shido himself. In fact, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know why. This arc takes its tone into a serious and emotional rollercoaster ride. She is the girl who sacrificed everything to Shido the most. Not only that, but she was also not given the opportunity, especially the less sensitive Shido. This arc also discusses more Origami\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past and who actually killed her parents. One thing that makes me irritating with this arc is her character.\n \nIt follows the same format as the first and second season. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even know which side she was on. At first, she lives her daily life happily ever after with Shido and other friends. But, she always became one of the antagonists for other reasons. And don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t start again with capitalism-like antagonists without any clear reason. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even know where to start. I think the show stops at this arc without having to add Shido again in the last episode as fanservice. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a harem so what do you expect?\n\nThis show has awkward and wisecracks humor dialogues. The music is still pretty good and decent but the artwork is just \u00e2\u0080\u009cspectacular\u00e2\u0080\u009d. I mean, J.C. Staff take their ego by taking various kinds of projects. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even want to start again. Clearly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDate A Live III\u00e2\u0080\u009d shows its chance to become an interesting series into a gimmick generic harem. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a shame that the studio takes too much of the third season which is also a request from fans themselves. I just want to watch this series as always from the beginning. But, just enough already."}]}
